She's the most homophobic fucking person I know but we still live under the same roof, unfortunately. I'm just, rather quietly, listening to Lady Gaga's new album when there's a knock at my door. It's my sister asking me, ""Who's that singing?"" in her most condescending attitude. I know her intentions by now and she just loves to put down anything she thinks is gay related, especially when it revolves around me. I answer her question and she just cries ""OH MY GOD.""

jagadiosa,0,0,1r18dk,1,"I work for a very large company as an IT Field agent and was tasked with installing a new system for my company which had an office inside of an EXTREMELY large Tech company that makes (hint) Processors.  The security for the building is very tight and while inside you must be escorted by the Associate who has clearance to walk about the building.  Since I was a guest I was required to have an escort with me at all times, the penalty if I were left alone would mean the permanent banning from re-entering the facility again.

My chaparone for the day was a nice guy whom I get along with great and had clearance.  He was also escorting his manager which did not have clearance.  This manager and I have never been buddies and he has on multiple occasions tried to humiliate me and talk down to me.  So when I found out that both my escort and him could never be separated, I hatched my plan.

I quickly requested to go to the coffee lounge and upon arrival immediately began drinking as much coffee as I can in a short amount of time.  My plan began to peek its head shortly after as my stomach made quick work of that dark fluid.  While inside the small cubicle with the two of them, I gave them a preview with a small hiroshima erupting from my ass.  I played ashamed and told them both I was sorry but I really needed to go to the restroom.  The manager professed his disaproval stating that he was very busy and could not step away.  I pleaded with them and eventually the three of us went to the restroom together.  Once I was in a stall and was certain the manager could hear, I unleashed the hounds of hell.  I proceeded to serenaded him with the loudest, wettest sharts I could muster.  I keep it going for a good ten minutes while they had to wait on me.  I felt bad for my friend who was innocent in all this, but I could not miss this chance to let this manager catch some of my shit for once.

n33dyourlov3,4,2,1r13h2,5,"A few months ago I worked as a cleaning lady in a large day care. This was below my experience and education, but I was living in an area where I couldn't fluently speak the first language (Quebec, French). I wouldn't say I'm too good for the position, but no one deserves to be treated the way that  I was being treated. 








 On my first day, a woman (Nessa) yelled in my face for not taking out the garbage the day before (before I started working there), I was told I ""no good clean"", and she had it in her head that I was hired on as her personal slave. 



Although I am responsible for 89% of the cleaning, Nessa still had tasks assigned to her... until she tricked me by saying her boss had asked me to take over her cleaning duties. It was awkward for her when my boss noticed this and told her off. 






While cleaning the toilets one morning, Nessa screamed for me to come.. I made my way down the hall immediately after washing my hands only to see her gesturing to me to come by slapping her knees as if I'm a dog. I was slightly offended, but I brushed it off as a possible cultural difference (Muslim community).



 Then, she kicks a chair at me and tells me to reach a hat a child had thrown out of reach. 














If asked nicely to help reach the hat, I would have had no problems, but asked like that and it not being in my list of employee duties, I decided to walk away leaving Nessa to do the dirty work. After a month of harassment, embarrassment, and belittling, I decided to walk out early-mid shift leaving good ol Nessa to clean the mess all by herself.","Treat me like a dog, I quit half way through my shift!!",7
RotatingMaleCow,0,0,1r0xcu,6,"A few weeks ago I was making a long drive up to visit some friends and happily flying along in the consistent flow of the fast lane. Everything was going swimmingly, as usual the fast lane was 10+ the speed limit and going by the other 3 lanes. I was so happy. Enter commander shitbird. This guy decides that he needs to go faster so he rides my ass so hard I cant even see his headlights. I'm not sure what he expected me to do as the 20 cars in front of me were going the exact same speed and were still much faster than the traffic to our right. I figured he'd ease off after a bit but nope, the commander stubbornly persisted, and then i saw a big semi truck coming up in the lane next to me. Going much slower than the fast lane. 

A mad grin leapt across my face and as I pulled up next to the semi i slowed down considerably to match it, twenty five miles slower than the fast lane. Unfortunately I had some collateral damage as there was a car behind the commander but there is no way I was about to let this opportunity pass. For a whole 25 fucking minutes commander shitbird was my bitch and going 15 mph slower than he was previously. I was so happy in that moment I could have vigorously masturbated but I did't want to miss a minute of his misery. Maybe next time if you'd like to continue to enjoy the speed of the fast lane you should reconsider the impudent tailgate. Shitbird. ",Tailgater gets stuck next to a semi which gave me a semi,6
The_Forbidden_Toot,6,8,1r0gs1,15,"I had a (26 year old) friend from the Navy visit me for a week and she was a horrible house guest! Here is a list of her behaviors:

* Upon arrival to my house, does not say hello to my parents. Talks loudly using ""fuck"" and ""pussy"" every other sentence while sitting two feet away from the people she hasn't even greeted.
* Puts her dirty laundry on my bed. On my floor. On my chair. All over my room.
* Her and my other friend want to go the bar on a Wednesday night. I have school the next day, so I go visit my girlfriend and tell them I will be back at 9:30. When I get to the bar they are gone, their phones are dead. I search the town bars for an hour and don't find them.
* They finally show up drunk as fuck and loud at 1am. She stomps into my room laughing and shushing at the same time, even though she's the loud one. Doesn't even apologize the next day.
* My house runs on a well, the well pump broke and we didn't have water for a few days. She shits in every toilet in the house and doesn't flush it with the pool water even after I told her how to do it.
* Since I have school in the mornings I had to leave her by herself for a few hours. When I came back one day, the room had garbage and dirty dishes everywhere. When I asked her to pick it up a few hours later she called me ""Mom"" and acted like I was being a prude. I shouldn't have to fucking tell you!
* We went out to a bar on Saturday. She continually made snide remarks about my girlfriend and how I'm a ""grandma"" because I don't want to drink (even though I'm DD and having a good time with everyone).
* She gets so drunk that she starts talking shit about my girlfriend during the car ride home, even after I tell her to shut up and that she doesn't know her. She says she doesn't remember what she said the next morning, but that she's sorry. I tell her she smells like a bar.
* When I took her to my Aunt's so she could shower I brought a towel from my house. When we went to leave I asked her where it was, she said ""Upstairs, do I have to get it? I don't want to."" Are you fucking kidding me?!
* Got kicked out of a bar for stealing other patrons drinks and then calls the people around here rude and stuffy. 
* Borrows my laptop to watch Netflix and gets grease on the keys and trackpad, then laughs about it when I ask her wtf. 
* Borrows my car the day I go to a Seahawk's game (already had tickets before I knew she was coming), spills soda in the cup holder and doesn't bother to clean it. Puts a drinking glass in my car which then breaks and doesn't fucking clean it.
* Claims she's an asshole, but wants to be treated like she's Gandhi. 

My petty revenge!! I ended up spending the rest of my nights with my girlfriend (who refused to meet my ""friend""). I stopped engaging in conversation. When she'd start talking I'd make phone calls. When she asked me what she should do about her SO, I'd tell her that they probably cheated on her while she was visiting me. I didn't offer her food or the water we had to drink. I didn't offer to take her anywhere. I gave her a smelly towel to shower with. I gave her the coldest shoulder anyone could fucking give. When I dropped her off at the airport I gave her the single chop wave and said ""have a safe flight"".

LochnessLurky,5,6,1r0cz0,36,"So this happened right after I graduated high school. I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates. We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip. We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London. My girlfriend is getting thirsty, so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink. She grabs a chocolate milk, pays for it, and we walk back to our gate. After opening it and taking a sip, she asks me to smell it. I do, and it definitely smells sour. Just to be sure, I take a small drink to verify. We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her: 

Me: “We just purchased this chocolate milk, but it is bad. Can you give us a refund?” 

Clerk: “It’s already opened, so no I cannot refund the drink”

Me: “It’s bad. You shouldn’t even be selling it. Can you replace it with another drink?”

Clerk: *Smells milk* “It smells fine. You can buy another drink if you’d like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is here”.

At this time I asked her to call the manager. I had an hour to kill before the plane left, so why not. She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager. As people come up and try to buy drinks, I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk 15 minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in. I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them. The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rage:

Clerk: “DON’T TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERS!!!!”

Bitch, I already bought something. And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake. At this point I decided to cut my losses. This lady was on a mission to keep her $2.00 even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk. I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were. She had 2 rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets. There must have been upwards of 200 little packets in each basket. I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich, to which she replied “Yes”.

My mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor. I picked up the two baskets, dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch, walked 15 feet to the trash can, and emptied my pouch. I thought that was all, but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments. I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk, then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages. I then walked back to my gate, but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service. I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding, but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy too.

So there it is, the story of how I paid $2.00 for some sour chocolate milk and 500 condiment packets. Hope you enjoyed.

Tired0wl,10,11,1r0c31,54,"I just got off work and decided to grab some groceries before going home.

You know how people don't get personal space and decide to push their cart THISCLOSE when you're in line? The lady behind me was like that. Maybe it was because I was giving the person in front of me enough room. Like a good citizen.

Anyhow, I'm bagging my own groceries and chatting with the cashier. Lady behind me pushes her cart toward me. I give her *the look* but she ignores me.

The cart comes further, and she's actually pushing the damn thing into me. I sigh loudly, in an attempt to point out, umm, I'm standing here. YOU CAN WAIT THIRTY GODDAMNED SECONDS TO PUSH YOUR CART HERE.

Nope. Nothing. She knows what she's doing. She just looks at me in that, ""I know what I'm doing but I also know you won't do anything about it"" look. I don't know what the fuck her problem is.

I scoot the front of the cart behind me for a little more room. She takes this as an invitation to CONTINUE PUSHING HER FUCKING CART INTO ME. At this point, the cart is halfway into the walkway and I'm squeezed between it and the counter. What in the actual fuck.

I still have to pay, but the cart is preventing me from reaching the credit card reader. I grab it and swing it full out into the walkway. I swipe my card and finish the transaction. As I'm walking out, I push the cart even further away from her.

The look on her face was priceless. It was the face of an entitled bitch who never got her shit taken from her.

Also, she will have to go get the cart because she had at least $100 worth of crap.","If you can't wait your turn, you will lose your cart.",65
nappyheadedho,13,13,1r0678,108,"My freshman roommate seemed to be a pretty decent guy at first, but it quickly became apparent that it would be a tough year after he started to get comfortable. I like to go to sleep fairly early for a college student (around 11 PM or so), and my roommate goes to bed who knows when. This wouldn't be a problem if he just quietly did his homework or listened to his music through headphones. This is the opposite of what he does.

He likes to keep the room light on and loudly play the same Spotify playlist on repeat of about 6 songs exclusively taken from Madden NFL video game soundtracks. He also sings along. 

Every night I wake up to this and, as nicely as possible, ask him to use his desk lamp and headphones. He always does at first, but about 15 minutes later the light comes back on and the headphones come unplugged. I don't understand. I tried talking to him about it during the day, but he was unapologetic. 

Two nights ago I decided I'd had enough. He didn't have a morning class the next day, and I had to get up at 7 for my morning class. I set my alarm for six thirty and fought through the noise for the last time.

When I got up, I opened my laptop and played [this] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2EGKt8yONI) (which I actually happen to enjoy) at full volume. Needless to say, he wakes up very confused. ""Can you use headphones or something, man?"" I plug in my headphones for approximately 5 minutes and then unplug them. He woke up again, and this time he clearly got the picture. He just covered his ears with his pillow until I left.

Last night I slept like a log.

ecklcakes,6,12,1r0660,26,"Not entirely sure if this is the right place to post this but I can't think of anywhere better for now and felt like sharing!

I was at a friend's house warming party with a group of friends, it was also her flatmate's birthday party. I knew maybe a third of the people there, seeing as we all go to the same university.

I'm having a great night with mates from my uni course and my flat mates. We're all fairly drunk by this point. A friend, lets call her Jane, comes up to me and she looks a bit upset and fairly pissed off. I ask what's up and Jane tells me that some guy had just been talking to his friends and essentially told them that he had gotten with her one time, clearly trying to impress them.

This never happened, she doesn't know the guy, none of my mates with me there did either.

So she asks me if I wouldn't mind just pretending to be her boyfriend and having a chat with him. I'm pretty pissed off with what this dick's been saying so I think I'll go have a talk. I'm not a confrontational person, I always try to defuse situations, I'm not the sort of guy to go over and smack him in the face; but honestly I was angry enough that if refused I was ready to threaten him at the very least.

Jane points me in his direction, so I stroll over, he's currently standing near some of his friend with a drink, holding his phone. So I say, ""Hi, how are you? I don't think we've met. I'm Ecklcakes.""

""Oh hi, I'm good, I'm Carlos.""
(again made up name, mostly because I don't actually remember)

""Nice to meet you, listen, I just heard that you might have been saying something about my girlfriend, Jane, and I think you might want to apologise.""

I'm smiling, speaking in a pleasant tone and generally trying to look as non-threatening as possible. I'm not a big guy or anything, I'm average height and this guy has a few inches on me, similar builds, maybe I'm slightly sturdier looking.

In any case, this guy could probably take me on, if you look at it from the logic of a bigger drunk guy. But as soon as I say those words the guy pales, goes completely still and starts stammering out an apology and takes back everything he said.

And man it felt so good seeing him shit himself like that, almost felt sorry for the dickhead.

I feel like my relaxed nature and smile while saying something which sounds almost like a threat probably took him completely off guard and he realised he had fucked up in the first place. Alcohol can make you do stupid things I guess. Cheers for reading.

I work as a Data Entry/Computer Tech guy for my dad's oil lab. We do various fuel testing, oil analysis and such for vehicle engines, fuel depots and our local air base and airport. Not the best job in the world but it pays the bills with a decent amount left over for fun money.

Now, there is one particular co-worker of mine, who as of late, has had a major stick up his ass and for the life of me I cannot figure out why. He always seems to be groaning or complaining about something or other in the lab (i.e. it's too cold in the garage bay area; it's too hot in the lab area;, that kinda stuff) However, recently he has taken to talking nasty to one of my other co-workers behind my back in regards to how quickly I do my own work and get the sample data in the computers and then out into the lab technicians. The most recent one this morning was as follows:

""All he does is sit in there and fuck around on that god damned computer. Wish I could sit around and fuck off all day and get paid for it. Lazy fuck."" This is said out in the lab where he seems to forget sound rebounds and comes back into the front area where i work. I let it slide, as I don't need to worry about his grievances and just focus on my work. However, he didn't leave it be at that. Not ten minutes later as I am working on my second tray of samples for the morning, he comes in and snaps his fingers at me to go faster. ""get the lead out"", he has shit to do and wants off early. I grit my teeth and just continue on my way. But oh no my friends, I am not letting this slide.

After he leaves work today, and up until the end of the year, I am going to snap the pencil lead in all of his pencils at his work station, making it so he has to sharpen his pencils first thing every day for the rest of the year. Who needs to get the lead out now, Mr. Complains-a-lot?

PurplePeduncles,7,14,1qzihb,39,"This happened at the store I worked in and didn't involve me, but I figured the story was worth telling. On my mobile so excuse formatting (and long text, I've put in a TL;DR)

I was hired as a sales assistant in a new branch of a large footwear company, along with several other new employees. The store opened a couple of weeks ago and, for the most part, the new team all get along and everyone is friendly. However, the new supervisor (let's call him Pete) had already shown himself to be... not exactly the best supervisor. Put briefly, he got into arguments with the manager of the store that he trained in, childishly complained that he wanted to go home one evening when everyone was staying up late getting the shop set-up, and then disappeared without telling anyone when he was told that he needed to stay, and generally did not follow instructions or act professionally in store. 

On one of these occasions, our area manager was visiting, and this pretty much resulted in her telling our manager (we'll call her Amy) to ""get rid of him"". His next shift comes around, and he is called into the office for a 'meeting', and (even though our manager didn't want to as she has always gotten along with him) he is fired on the spot.

However, this wasn't the end of it for Pete.

First, he put in an appeal to get his job back. Fair enough, but seeing as the area manager herself told Amy to fire him, chances of that were slim.

A few days later, we spot Pete and his girlfriend walking around the shopping centre. You have to get a bus out to where we are, so everyone thinks this is a bit odd, but brushes it off. Later on his girlfriend walks into the shop, looks around, then leaves. No big deal. Until, that is, we're cleaning up and we find the notice for his replacement screwed up into a little ball and stuffed into a shoe. Very professional.

But wait, there's more. A little while after we find the notice, an angry-looking guy in his 40s strides up to me, and demands that he talk to the manager, naming her, saying they ""need a private chat"". He refuses to give a name. Amy comes out, and he insists they go into the stock room to talk. Fast forward a little bit, he leaves, and Amy reveals that the mystery man was none other than Pete's dad (Pete is 18 but has moved in with his girlfriend) who has demanded to know why his son had been fired because he was being blamed for something my assistant manager mistakenly did a few days prior (long story short, if you're going to comment on customers, wait until they've left the store and can't hear you...). Pete's dad threatens Amy with solicitors and appeals, but after explaining why Pete had actually been fired, he looks pretty embarrassed and left.

We figured it would end there, but nope, he had one last stunt to pull. Amy used to be the assistant manager in another store in the shopping centre we're in, and is still in contact with her old colleagues. A couple of days ago, she gets a text from one of them saying 'I've had someone called Pete hand in a CV today saying ""This is to replace Amy"" '. Reeeeal mature.

His appeal hearing is this Friday with our area manager, who has been made aware everything that has gone on. In this case, I really don't think any amount of petty revenge will help him get his job back.


TL;DR - Supervisor lost his job, appealed for wrongful dismissal, then ripped down the ad for his replacement and left it in the shop, sent his dad in to shout and my manager, then applied to 'replace' my manager's place at her previous job. Before his appeal.

wellingtonbear,19,28,1qzeqs,93,"I got my petty revenge sorta indirectly during my first job working at Officemax.

I worked the furniture department, and on all the desks, chairs, etc, I would print up the little pull tags and place them in holders on each item in the department.  There were hundreds of items and thousands of tags since the store didn't want the number of tags to match the actual inventory (we could order an item if we were out of stock) and most desks were sold in parts so we had multiple sets of tags for one desk.   I'd print these out daily due to the number of people who are just browsing and take home tags of stuff they were interested in but didn't actually buy.

So one Saturday afternoon this couple comes in with this little brat that is just running wild all over the store.  Yelling, screaming, picking up and slamming the handsets down on the display phones and fax machines, taking merchandise off the rack and throwing it onto the floor, etc.  Just being a general terror, and the parents just completely ignoring her.

A different customer came in and bought a desk, so I went to the back and found the item, loaded it on a flat bed cart and wheeled it up to the front desk to carry it out to their car from them.   Our entrance was at the very end of the shopping center, and customers had to walk PAST the exit door to get to the entrance door.  This was very annoying because if the exit doors opened when they walked by it, they would walk in through the exit while i was trying to wheel out heavy furniture, so whenever I would see this happening i would turn off the sensor on the door so it would not open from the outside, and they'd naturally continue to the next door.

I saw the father of this nightmare outside talking on the phone and was pacing back and forth and i saw the door open.  I instinctively walked over to shut off the outside sensor.  As I was walking to where the switch was, that's when I saw it.. the brat was running out to meet her father, and was double fisting a giant stack of pull tags she had removed from nearly every single desk in my department.  Just as she exited the carpeted area of the furniture dept, she threw them up into the air like confetti.

She ran right past me and out the door and sat down on the curb next to her dad.  I was flabbergasted, and fucking pissed that i now had to pick up all that shit, sort them out, and find the appropriate desks.  Since the parents obviously didn't give a shit, all I could do was flip the switch turning off the outside sensor so at least she couldn't get back in.

Then it happened.  I walked back to take my place behind the cart with the desk on it, and the little girl turned around and spotted her mom at the next register.  She stood up and yelled, ""mommy!"" and darted towards the door, which had just started to close.  With the censor off, it was not stopping as she approached.  She got there just in time to stick her fat head through the crack of the door as it closed, pinning it up against the door jamb.  

She immediately tried to fall, but for a good second and a half, the door held her up BY HER HEAD as her body dangled, then the door opened because it was obstructed, and dropped her right on her face.

lessthanthreesquared,18,34,1qzcxw,169,"A friend and I were traveling together, but had been assigned an aisle and window seat. We were hoping no one would be seated between us, but some guy hopped on the flight just before we left. My friend asked him if he wanted an aisle seat—he said, ""sure!"" and started to get up, but when she pointed out that in the row next to ours  and the one behind us there were empty aisle and middle seats, he refused politely and sat back down. Weird, but no big deal. We expected someone to be in the middle seat when we got the seating assignments, so this guy's own stupidity confused us more than it annoyed us.

Generally, I tend to give the person in the middle seat a lot of leeway: full reign of the armrest, keeping any of my movements into their space to a minimum (air, lights, etc). He began our relationship by splaying his elbows into my seating area, and listening to shitty live music on his phone without headphones, but electronic devices would be turned off soon enough, and I figured I'd only need to say something if he did it again after takeoff. I used a magazine as a force field to get his elbow out of my seat, turned the channel to something boring enough to sleep to, and settled in. Thankfully the music stopped once he turned off his phone for takeoff, and I thought it would be the end of that.

Once we were in the air, though, he threw his jacket over himself, spilling sleeves and coattails into my seat and my friend's seat, and both of us kept handing back his sleeves, asking him to be more careful. He'd make a show of tucking in loose ends and being in his own space, but every time he shifted it would happen again. I later found out he had also used my friend's armrest controls and gotten wildly confused when his channels weren't changing, but when he was asked to stop did he apologize? Of course not. He was just generally a clueless idiot.

Here's the thing: clueless idiot thing aside, he *really wasn't that bad.* Until...

My personal last straw was when I fell asleep comfortably, and woke up in a deep sweat because he had taken it upon himself to turn off my air. He kept craning his neck into my seating area to look out the window, so once I caught on to that, I shut it for the rest of the flight ""so I could sleep."" Thing is, I like to see the lights in the city when we land, so I had to weigh my options when we began to descend: I knew he would enjoy the show, but I, too, wanted to see the lights, and I felt an opportunity for petty revenge.

So I opened the window, and he jumped into action, craning his neck, moving his elbows into my space, trying to see better. So I made sure my whole face was taking up that window and I turned around to make my best ""Wow, this is AMAZING"" face at my friend. Eventually he reached behind me to open the window between us and the row behind us, but by then he was clearly agitated and the plane had reached the landing strip—too late. I leaned back in my seat, affecting his view of the other window, and shut my own window pointedly.

When we got off the plane, we were behind him talking about how pretty the city looks from up in the sky, and he shot me a nasty look before we parted ways. I could only grin.

compuhyperglobalmega,29,69,1qzcpe,402,"Was sitting in massive surface street commuter traffic.  This was 6-lane road near several shopping centers and multiple intersections jammed with cars, very slow going.  My goal was in sight, however.  If I could just make it through the next light, I could hit the freeway onramp and get out of here.  As luck would have it, the light turned red just as the car in front of me crawled through the intersection.  Stuck for another 5 minutes.  My own irritation was interrupted by a loud honk from behind, and I glanced in my rearview mirror to see a middle-aged woman in a lifted Ford F250 gesturing wildly at me, as though I cost her the light.

I just smiled and prepared to ignore her, until I noticed the red lights of a fire truck and EMT heading our way from behind, trying to make their way through the traffic jam.  There were so many cars with nowhere to go, at one point they were forced to cut through the shopping center parking lot.  

While I’m watching this drama unfold, our light turned green, and F250 lady immediately began honking and waving her arms at me.  What she didn’t notice through her rage (but everybody else on the road did), was just as the light turned green, the EVs had swung into the opposing traffic lanes which had cleared out. It was obvious they were going to hit our intersection and swing back into our lanes which had cleared out ahead of the intersection during the red light.  The only thing I could do was sit tight, keep the intersection clear, and stay out of the way. 

I just kept watching in my rearview as the lady became more and more enraged, and EVs got closer and closer.  She was laying on the horn continuously just as the EVs blew by on the left and swung in front of us and went on their way.  The look of horror on her face as she suddenly realized that everyone nearby was staring at her like the asshole she was, was doubled when our light turned red again before we could get through, and I got to watch her cringe with embarrassment for five more minutes.",Emergency Revenge,471

FredFltStn,68,179,1qz5am,555,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Josh is one of the guys that work for me every year at my fireworks tent, although I have to use the term “work” loosely with Josh. He’s a tall, skinny, 19 year old high school dropout, who would rather be lighting up than working given the choice. His parents are two of my good friends, which is the ONLY reason he still works for me.

When we’re working, I spend and unreasonable amount of time playing the “Where’s Josh” game. It’s like “Where’s Waldo”, but usually involves Josh sitting out of sight in the back of the storage container or “going to the bathroom” for 30 minutes. I know that if I’m not watching him, there’s a 86% chance that he’s sitting on his ass somewhere avoiding work.

Josh always owes people money. Friends, family, enemies, me, the list goes on and on. Since I’m pretty much his only source of regular income, and I only work him about 6 weeks out of the year, Josh is perpetually broke or in debt.

Last year, his mother let me know that Josh owed them some BIG bucks, several hundred dollars. They were making him pay for the repairs from when they were out of town and Josh had drunkenly stolen his father’s car, and then conveniently wrecked it into his mother’s car. Sadly, just another day with Josh. 

I talked to Josh about it and he seemed embarrassed, and asked me to work him as many hours as possible so he could pay his parents back. Feeling sorry for him (I’m a sucker); I let him pick up extra shifts.

I gave him his paycheck after the first week of work, and reminded him that he needed to pay his mother back. He assured me that he would. He then cashed the paycheck on blew the entire thing on fast food, liquor, and “herbs”. His parents were disappointed, but not really surprised.

I gave him hell after I found out what he’d done, and he assured me that he was going to pay back his parents with the next paycheck. I’m a sucker, not an idiot, and I know Josh too well. 

From July 1st on, we work a TON of hours, since that’s by far our busiest time of the year, and everyone’s happy when payday arrives. I hadn’t forgotten the fast one that Josh had pulled with the last paycheck, and I mentioned to him more than once that he needed to cash his next paycheck and give the entire amount to his parents.

On payday, I walked up to Josh carrying my checkbook and said, “Is this entire check going to your mom?”

He of course assured that it was, and danced around like a kid on Christmas while I filled out the check. I told him the amount, folded the check in half, handed it to him, and thanked him for his help.

About 20 minutes later, I got a text from Josh that said,
&gt;You bastard.

Apparently, Josh and several of his friends went to a check cashing store to cash his check and start the party. They had already made plans to hit the beach and get wasted after they cashed the check, but the store wouldn’t cash it for him.

My text response back to Josh was:
&gt;What? I asked you if the entire check was going to your mother and you confirmed it. Per your request, I made the check payable to your mother. Thanks again for all the hard work.

k-squid,26,85,1qytdq,327,"My first job was in a bowling alley/arcade. I originally worked at the prize counter, and then switched over to the food court. They're not the best stories of revenge, but they felt pretty good for 16 year old me.

The first tale of revenge comes from a real prick of a coworker. During my first week, he constantly left me alone behind the counter to go hang out in the food court with some other employees. If I had a problem and went to ask him for help, he would refuse to move if I didn't have every minute detail, leaving me running back and forth between Prick and a now annoyed customer. There were many times where he left the counter to go play games on the clock, something I had been told was a fire-able offense. He constantly had a problem with anything I said or did or enjoyed. When introducing me to other employees or regulars, he would always say, ""That's k-squid, the lesbian,"" because I had a short hair cut. He also would refer to me as ""retard"" or call anything I liked ""retarded"".

You may be wondering whether or not I went to management. I did. Multiple times. I told them exactly what Prick was saying and doing, but they either ignored it or laughed and said something like, ""Yep, that's Prick for you!"" I tried going to the arcade manager to get different shifts, but there were none available. I was stuck working with Prick all the time.

Eventually, we all found out that Prick had dropped out of high school. In May of his senior year. No intention of continuing elsewhere or getting a GED. 

Wat. 

On this particular night, some of Prick's friends had come in to say hi and play games, and Prick started making fun of everything about me, his friends joining in and all of them having a good laugh at my expense. Finally, Prick says, ""K-squid, you're such a fucking retard."" Without skipping a beat, I replied, ""Yeah? I may be a retard, but at least I won't have to work here for the rest of my fucking life."" He stared at me, slack jawed, while his friends were rolling with laughter. He never called me retarded again.

The second story of revenge took place after I switched to the food court to get away from Prick, and while I was planning on putting in my two weeks notice. A friend from school had gotten me an interview at the coffee shop he worked at, and it seemed definite that I would be hired. (I was, in the end.)

Being that the bowling alley was my first job ever, I was a total ~~model employee~~ suck up. I'd be there early every day, stay late, do whatever the managers asked without complaint or question, and took shifts for people whenever they asked. After switching to the food court, it was also rather common for the food court manager to schedule me from 2pm-10m, and then come to me at 7pm the day of to say that she was leaving to see her boyfriend and that I was to stay until close, at 2am. I did this without complaint, and often without a break even though it was illegal to have someone under 18 working past midnight.

I had put in a request off for a particular weekend well in advance. I was promised that I would have it off with no issue. Lo and behold, I get scheduled both Saturday and Sunday. I went to the food court manager who told me that she and her boyfriend had decided to go away for the weekend, so I would just have to work. I went to the GM, who told me there was nothing he could do. I had to find someone to cover both shifts. Of course, not a single person was willing to take my shifts. Even though I'd taken at least 3 shifts for each of them. I went back to the GM who told me, ""It's not my problem. I don't care.""

Defeated, I went home at the end of my shift and just bawled. I was so sick of being treated like complete shit, of being talked down to and taken advantage of. It was then that I decided my revenge. 

Cue to Saturday afternoon, 1:58 pm. I'm sitting comfortably in my PJs at home. The bowling alley, arcade, and food court were likely already swamped with customers and it would only continue to get more and more busy. I called the food court and said I wouldn't be coming in. I'd quit. The guy I was supposed to work with immediately got the GM on the line. ""You can't quit now! It's the busiest night of the week! [Male coworker] is the only one we've got! [Food Court Manager] is out of town, and I know you couldn't find anyone else to work for you! What do you expect us to do?!"" I took a breath, steadied my voice and said, ""It's not my problem.

So, today DD went out to take his guitar to his car, and my friends and I were sitting in the lobby just hanging around. We see him walk back up to the front doors and LOW AND BEHOLD, they're locked. He starts banging on the windows, on the door, but oh no, I'm not coming to his rescue.

I was going to the grocery store just for a quick purchase.

I saw cars parking like that often, but this time, it was grinding my gears at the highest point. 

My first idea was to leave a note saying ""You park like an asshole"" and leave, but I was out of paper. I was about to give up my plan until I had an idea. I took a picture of the licence plate and went to a cashier inside the grocery store. I told the cashier that I saw a tow truck around the car, like it was about to tow it, and that I guessed that it was because of the way it was parked (I thought about it, I wanted the owner to know somehow) And then, I go to make my purchase.

Less than a minute after (I told you guys it was a QUICK purchase), I go back to the cashier and pay for my purchase. Since it was the same one I saw a minute before, she starts giving me updates on the car situation, letting me know that everything was okay, no tow truck was there anymore. The cashier even pointed me who was the vehicle owner. 

Cashier : There was no tow truck you told me, right?

Owner : Nope. None. I guess it was okay, kind of a false alarm.

Me : Well, how disappointing.

This is a little more ""fun"" than most posts on here as it contains no real malice or anger, but I think it's funny nonetheless.

I had a roommate in college, let's call him Bob.  Bob's a great guy and we got along great, living together for about 3 years in college.  For various reasons, I moved around a lot after college and ended up moving back in with Bob for about a year and a half.

During this time, Bob decided to start messing with my computer.  Bob is a bit of prankster by nature.  Mostly it was minor stuff that was mildly annoying (picking the bathroom lock and pouring cold water on me in the shower, hiding and trying to scare the shit out of me when I come around a corner, etc).  I am really not prankster, but I will only take so much before I get revenge.

Bob wasn't great with computers beyond the basics like web surfing, typing, etc, but I think I know the day that he learned out how to change desktop backgrounds because I came into my room to find a naked dude, hand on his manhood, as my desktop background.  Bob was hiding out and giggled when he saw me discover the prank.  I rolled my eyes, changed the background back, and did what I needed to do on my computer.  I probably should have set a password on my computer at this point, but who wants to do that?

Anyway, I come back later in the day to find the same picture as my background.  Bob laughs.  I change it back again, silently making a note to think of a revenge plan.

Bob traveled a fair amount for his work, but it did not always require his work laptop, so he often left it at home.  Shortly after I found a naked dude as my background, he went out of town for work and I had decided how I was going to get revenge.

I opened up his laptop to discover he had set a password.  His girlfriend (who also lived with us) happened to be around and she helpfully gave me the password (she did her best to stay out of our pranks on one another so she assumed she could avoid blowback by helping me) and I set about doing the deed.

Cut to a couple days later when Bob comes home.  He opens up his laptop and clicks on IE to do some surfing.  A gay porn video immediately starts and I start laughing.  He scowls at me and says sarcastically something to the effect of ""that's funny"" and then tries to open IE again.  Same result.  

He tries various other shortcuts on his desktop only to find that I have helpfully reset all of his shortcuts to point at the gay porn video that I had downloaded and hidden on his hard drive.  After watching the first few seconds of the video the fourth time, he starts whining about it being his work computer and how I need to fix it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't want to get into trouble.

Being the nice guy I am, I fix it.  He didn't mess with my computer again.  And I think he was annoyed with his girlfriend for throwing him under the bus.  Not my problem.

neenerneenerboo,72,477,1qw75b,1218,"Sorry this is long. But oh so sweet. 


This guy that went to my high school, Jimmy, was the absolute worst. He was the typical asshole jock—everyone let him get away with shit. But I acted cordial around him because we shared mutual friends and classes. I would sometimes call him out in a teasing way, so he thought we were even friends. 


My main beef with him was the way he treated girls. Though Jimmy wasn’t very attractive, he coasted on popularity, and our school was very small with more girls than boys. He mostly preyed on underclassmen (my first interaction with him was turning him down as a freshman because he seemed creepy) but he was a great charmer and manipulator when he wanted to be, so I witnessed over and over again as he’d suck in one of my friends, who would be convinced that he’s changed for her and being genuinely nice this time, and then turn on the assholery once she was emotionally invested. 


He dated one of my friends, Jane, who is the sweetest person in the world. She was going through some tough times at home with a prolonged family illness and Jimmy just would not give her a break. Telling her she’s gaining weight, flirting with other girls in front of her, general toying of her emotions. You could tell she was super stressed out, and finally she broke up with him. Wahoo! 


But it didn’t end there. We had assigned seats in computer class, and I sat between Jimmy and Jane’s sister, Beth, who is equally sweet. On the other side of Jimmy sat all of his jock friends (close to Mr. Teacher’s desk so he could try to keep them in check) where they would act obnoxious and talk loud so that the whole room could hear about how awesome they were. Right after the breakup, Jimmy talked about how he’s over it and already has “a few public school sluts lined up,” (lols, private school life—this was the equivalent of having a girlfriend you “met on vacation so she lives in a different city”) and other stuff that was really disrespectful to Jane, and it seemed very intentionally done in front of Beth, who was not a confrontational person. 


I plotted. Jimmy was very insecure about his intelligence. Since he was put in the spotlight so often, it was easy to see that while he could get an A+ at getting girls to send him nudes, he struggled academically. So, I left lunch early one day to get in the computer room before everyone else. I hooked up an extra mouse and keyboard into his computer, pulling the cords behind and underneath the desk so that the mouse and board could rest hidden under my pull-out keyboard (there was a lot of hidden room, they sat just out of view above my own keyboard.) 


Jimmy made a loud and unnecessary entrance as usual, but when he tried to log in to his computer to start the assignment, he just could not get it right. This is because I would sneakily tap a key as he would type in his student password. He tries a few more times before yelping for help from Mr. Teacher, who looks annoyed after typing in Jimmy’s information just fine. “Maybe you had your password wrong?” he says, but Jimmy is insistent that he isn’t that stupid and something is wrong with the computer. 


I tormented Jimmy for weeks, pushing the extra keyboard and mouse as far up as I could to hide it in between classes. He would put his mouse icon over a button, and then I’d slightly wiggle my extra mouse before he clicked on it, infuriating Jimmy that he could not select something. Inputting passwords and other information was often impossible. His documents were full of typos. He would type a word, and I would just press one letter to throw him off, and then he’d try again, only for the same thing to happen. Pretty soon he just used spellcheck instead, but right-clicking that function was difficult for him when I was paying attention. Open the task manager while he’s in a program. He’d look away, and I’d close a window or document, or just press backspace until he turned around. I was careful to be pretty inconsistent—when other people were looking, I’d back off to make him look crazy. Whatever he’d been trying to do would always work when Jimmy called the teacher over. My movements were minute and mixed in seamlessly as I typed on my real keyboard. 


I started to punish him this way. Wandering eye? Wandering mouse while he’s trying to play a game. Distracted as he bragged to his friend about texting with that naïve freshman? Oh look, his PowerPoint text boxes somehow all got rearranged. Ignore new girlfriend because it’s funny? Unexpected shutdown, because losing unsaved work is funnier. One time he tried to reset a password where the characters are replaced with dots for privacy, and I put a number at the end of his new password, and the same thing when he confirmed the password. This new password then didn’t work, and he couldn’t reset it again without knowing the current password. Jimmy was going nuts, but it was all so subtle that his complaints made him look like a crazy person who didn’t know how to use a computer. He insisted over and over again that something was wrong with the computer. His assignments took longer, so he had less time to horse around with his friends. People started to talk about how irritable and unpleasant he was during computer class, and people would even tease him about not being able to use technology if he had any problems with his iPhone or anything. 


One time, when I was sure that no one else was looking and Jimmy didn’t even have his hands on anything, I wiggled the mouse slightly back and forth as he stared at the screen. His eyes widen and he shouts, “Look!” interrupting Mr. Teacher’s lecture. I stop. “It was doing it! My mouse was moving and I wasn’t even doing anything!” We all look at each other in disbelief over Jimmy’s delusions as he keeps yelling, myself and Beth included, although we were laughing on the inside, giddy at the thought of telling Jane later about Jimmy’s meltdown. 


“That’s it,” Mr. Teacher said, worn thin over Jimmy’s incompetence. “No one else is having problems with that computer. You’re just not compatible, I guess. Move to that one.” He points to a computer far away from his buddies and any other students, which is usually used by people giving presentations or student teachers. 


Jimmy protests, suggesting Mr. Teacher “just fix it,” but at this point, Jimmy is pretty done with that computer too. We weren’t bothered by Jimmy too much the rest of the year in that class. But to my surprise, Jimmy still had problems. Almost all the stuff I was doing. He stopped complaining since it made him look like he was just hopeless with simple tasks, but he would still ask me questions about what it could be after class since he thought I was relatively good with computers. One day alone in the computer room, I was inspecting the computer that Jimmy used when Mr. Teacher comes in. He sat down at his desk and got a sly look on his face as he messed with a cordless mouse, which wiggled around on Jimmy’s screen. 


“Wifi,” he explained. 


Turned out, Mr. Teacher knew what I was doing all along. He hated dealing with Jimmy too, and distracting him meant less class disruption. But after his meltdown, Jimmy just raged quietly in his corner as he failed to engage his far-away friends. 


Tl;dr: Guy is a douche to my friend, plug a secret mouse and keyboard into his computer and mess with him. He goes crazy and everyone talks about it. 

Edit for more info: We had a pretty relaxed atmosphere, our teacher was a young lad who just taught an easy class in order to be a coach, and he was Jimmy's track coach, so even though Jimmy annoyed the shit out of him during class, they joked around a lot. At our school, the real authority was with the coaches so a prank like this between them would have been a big deal. He was the kind of teacher that let us spend a lot of time playing games and helped us with senior pranks as long as they were tame enough. He was just a few years out of college, and only really messed with jimmy when he was a disruption.

Jimmy really actually was bad with computers. At one point he thought his MacBook was totally broken because he accidentally leaned on the dim screen button so his screen was black. He would never notice anything unusual plugged into his computer. I know that using Bluetooth doesn't always require a USB and it has been many years since I was in high school, so perhaps that's what the teacher meant--I am really not that great with that stuff myself. Jimmy only thought I was good with computers because he was amazed by things like keyboard shortcuts.

binbincrackers,13,12,1qvk6c,77,"**BACKGROUND:** I go to university 2ish hours away from home and live there during the school year, I visit home once a month to visit and I take the bus each time.

**Story:** On the bus going back to school the last seat available is beside me and one last girl gets on and sits beside me. She has one backpack and a small rolling luggage. She tries to stuff it under the seat but unfortunately it didn't fit so she just left it in the aisle. For the first half of the ride she played Candy Crush quietly on her tablet which was fine by me but the second half of the ride she got a phone call and then proceeded to bitch at the other person on the end. She was really loud and complaining that whatever she was being asked to do and how she was studying and it stressed her out yada yada

What was she complaining about? About feeding chickens, about how she wanted a new chicken coop and that no one was feeding her chickens. She was yelling at the other person about how they're lazy and all they do is go to work and eat. She kept going in circles about how it stressed her out and how she wanted to speak to her mother. People sitting around us were also staring and shaking their heads. I usually nap during my bus rides but she was too loud and moved while she spoke.

When we arrived I was finally happy to be able to go home but she proceeds to go through her texts on her phone and her bag is blocking the aisle and people behind us can't get off. She's so absorbed in her texts that people saying excuse me and trying to shuffle past her bag didn't phase her.

I wanted to tell her to move the fuck out of my way but then I decided to get petty. My book bag was on my lap the entire ride so I moved my book bag with as much force I could muster after a cramped 2 hour bus ride towards the my left side where she was sitting. It nearly knocked her phone out of her hand and she finally looked up and saw that all of the seats in front of her were empty and people behind her bag were waiting to get off and staring at her.

Had two kids run up past the line, push the other kids out of the way, and then grab me to get some candy. I told them to wait their turn, and they stepped back, then pushed in front of the next kid. Parents are standing there smiling at them the whole time.

FredFltStn,5,67,1qv0xv,177,"**BACKGROUND:**  This is a story from my Food &amp; Beverage/Retail management days at a large entertainment/theme park company.

**STORY:**  Years ago, my friend and I were both supervisors for a large entertainment/theme park company in Orlando. We both worked evenings (different locations), and would usually hit the bars for a properly chilled adult beverage after work. This was before everyone carried a cell phone, and because of our jobs, we were required to be available by phone anytime if someone needed to reach us. Sadly, they knew to call be bar if it was before closing time.

Eventually, I was moved to the early morning shift. Since my then wife also worked mornings, this was definitely better for us (but I REALLY missed closing down the bars with my buddies). After I started working mornings, my friend started to prank call my house. The calls usually came around 3am, after he had finished work and was enjoying the nightlife. Occasionally, I’d be serenaded by a drunken group still in full swing at the bar. 

After the calls, I’d inevitably have to listen to 20 minutes of bitching about my drunken asshole friends. One day, after receiving three drunken calls the night before, I finally snapped. Before I went to bed, I called one of my employees and told him that once they had closed (usually around midnight), he needed to forward all of the location phones, and I gave him my friends home phone number.

As I understand it, the calls started coming in around 4am, and the phone basically didn’t stop ringing until I removed the call forwarding, about 4 hours later. His wife was not pleased. Amazingly, the drunk dialing stopped that day.

I controlled the lighting on a music program ""Top of The Pops"".

They replaced a dance troop with a new lot.

One of them went to school with my girlfriend, now wife, she told me of her bullying and arrogance and how she made her live a bit more miserable than it should have been. A few others also suffered. I went to the same school and never noticed just how bad she was, but being a studious kid and two years older I never hung with that crowd.   

When I got to the studio that changed. The dancer recognized me and thinking I was a audience member and said some thing along the lines of ""Hi there, fancy seeing you here. I'm a performing here you know, I might get you into the green room later, you can collect autographs"" that's not a bad thing to say but it was said with was a certain tone of voice and twist of her lip that irritated and I suppose my wife had primed me to dislike her.

The whole time, she also complained about stupid, lazy cashiers, to her bratty kids who were mixing up all of the candy bars on purpose. This woman looked me straight in the eyes, and said, ""I know these things are hard for people who aren't college educated.""

I was working on a Bachelor's at that time, and I was just about seething. I scanned in some organic grapes, but for whatever reason, they scanned in incorrectly as regular grapes.

I could have let it go. But instead, I called up the manager.

The last time I flew was around a year ago from Atlanta to Memphis. I know, almost not a real flight; you spent more time being groped than actually in the air. Whatever. 

Anyway, I'm 6'3""+ and about 280-290 lbs, with a football lineman build. I'm also black, remember this part. 

We start flying, blah blah. I've got my music going, I'm knee-deep into the seat before me, and the dude in front of me starts trying to push his seat back. I say trying because it failed each time, and I was just sitting there. 

I felt bad for the guy at first since he probably wanted to relax and nap. That sentiment lasted until he started pounding my knees vigorously by means of plane seat, as if it'd help him bust a quickie. I heard him mutter something about entitled fat black people, and then he started back again. 

Now I'll never be skinny, and never have been. But I feel like I look decent; got some fat and some muscle, and it's like that (and that's the way it is. Unh!). For the black part, I'm pretty sure entitlement is rather separate from race. After the umpteenth time, I readjusted myself, ensuring he could go nowhere. I heard his frustation. The dude even called a flight attendant, presumably to move some imagined whale of lore.

She comes, hears him out, whining and rambling as an entitled douche would. She looks back at me, and subtly smirks. I give her a thumbs up. She leaves and a wait a few minutes.

The new one just sees customers as dollar signs and when she gets a customer complaint, she berates the employee without listening to their side of the story. I had 3 complaints in 2 weeks since she's been there, but not one when the other guy was over the department. Needless to say her and I don't get along.

Now, our department manager used to be a fair person. She left for 2 months because she had blood clots in her legs. Since she's been back, she's been a different person. Very strict, very dictator like. I don't know if it has anything to do with the new assistant manager, but I wouldn't doubt it if it did.

Anyway enough back story. For the last month they've been fucking with my hours. There's usually 3 shifts for wireless in my store: opener, mid shift, and closer. It seems like whenever I'm scheduled for one of these shifts, and there's a second one scheduled, when they come in I always get sent back to electronics. Which is all and fine, but wireless hours are not as long as electronics hours. Not to mention they get mad at me for not completing my work despite the fact that I have to cover the breaks and lunch of whoever is in wireless. Classic case of overworked and underpaid. And let's not forget my hours have gone down to the point where I only have 25 hours a week now. Lucky if I ever see 28, VERY lucky if I ever see 35.

Here's the revenge part: This past Monday I got called by the place I first interviewed at when I moved to where I am now last December. I re applied and they want to interview me again. So I go, and 3 and a half hours after I interview they're offering me the job, which I immediately accept. The biggest reason? True full time hours (40 hours, not the retarded retail definition of full time), benefits, every Sunday off with another day during the week. I would've been an idiot not to accept it.

So I walked into my current work on Wednesday and gave them my notice, which was a satisfying feeling itself. What was even more satisfying was when the manager asked what my last day would be when I was putting my notice in writing. You should've seen the look on his face when I told him it would be the day before Thanksgiving. That is my ultimate revenge to them. You treat me like shit and screw me over? I will screw you right back.

While they're all forced to work Thanksgiving and Black Friday, I'll be enjoying dinner with my girlfriend's family and have a nice long weekend to rest and prepare for my new job on December 2nd.
Score one for the little guy!

TL;DR: My work fucks me over on hours. I retaliate by getting a full time job and making my last day the day before Thanksgiving so I don't have to work that day and Black Friday.

jabbatheslut,6,12,1qrpi5,61,"I live in an apartment complex with underground parking,  but unassigned spots. 
There are several towers, and I live in the smallest and farthest tower, which also is the least occupied, so the parking around my tower entrance generally isn't a problem. 

However, the complex's A/C machinery is right up against the spots for the tower, so it can be difficult to open your driver door if someone parks too close to the line. 

This douche with a Cayenne GTS has been making it difficult to park the last week, so I've been waiting for the right amount of inches to pull this off. 

He parked today a little to close, but just enough for me to get out with no issues; however he won't be able to get in without figuring out which apartment my car belongs to and me pulling out. 

I'm going to take a long shower tomorrow and ""not hear"" my phone. (Sunday is the first working day of the week here.)

DarthPaki,61,111,1qrjwh,410,"A bit of background, I'm 6'2"" with fairly long legs and I choose aisle seats when flying so I can stretch them every now and then.

&amp;nbsp;

So I was flying back from Vancouver to London and had settled in nice and early.  I was all ready to sleep most of the flight (popped some NyQuil, plane was landing in the afternoon, no jetlag!).  Now this really short guy gets on in the seat in front of me, he must've been 5'0""/5'1"" max (not hating on shorter people, just making an observation for the story).  Everyone settles in and gets ready for the flight and I pass out.

&amp;nbsp;

Cut to about half an hour into the trip, plane had just taken off, and I'm woken up by this guy just slamming his seat all the way back onto my legs.  Captain hasn't even turned off the seatbelt sign (the universal indication for ""go for it"").  I lean forward and politely ask the guy, ""can you please move your seat back a bit forward please.  I'm tall and you're bruising my knees"".  His response?  ""Whatever man, I paid for this seat"".  @$$hole mode, engage.

&amp;nbsp;

I make myself comfortable, take the magazines out of the seat pocket, slouch down a bit, and extend my legs to get comfortable to comfortably sleep.  I can now literally feel his spine on my knees.  Great.  I can poke him.  Man I feel a bit uncomfortable... guess I'll have to readjust my position every few minutes.  Does that mean my knees keep digging into his back?  Too bad.  Even when I'm not moving I could feel him trying to find a comfortable position.  I'd quickly move my knees so that by the time he leaned back again my knees had found his spine again.

&amp;nbsp;

I kept it up for at least 2-3 hours, the guy was stubborn as a mule.  He asked me if I could not hit him in the back and my response?  ""Sorry, I paid for the seat, you know?""  The look on his face was so priceless I wish I could have saved it somehow and show it my future grandkids (on the way after I get married and have actual kids as well), just to show them how badly PopPop (would love that as a grandad name) screwed over a douche on a plane.

&amp;nbsp;

He moved his seat back all the way up and didn't say anything for the rest of the flight.  Peace.

Morkant,9,21,1qr3bn,21,"So a few years back I worked at a fast-food restaurant in Canada. As an employee there I was required to work drive-thru on occasion which meant serving hundreds of people their food over the course of my shift. 


With hundreds of people coming through. And my shifts being later in the day (4-11 being the most common) I would try and be smiling and upbeat for every customer that came through. But sometimes you get that one that's so rude, you just need to stand up for yourself somehow.


So I'm working the drive-thru, it's mid-evening, about 7-8 o'clock and the rush has died down. The store is fairly empty and there's only a few of us left working (night shift doesn't get in until 10:30). I hear a beep at my headpiece and I answer a middle aged man's call for a pair of donuts. 


Grabbing the donuts I quickly trotted over to the drive-thru window and took his money whilst handing him his donuts in a little paper baggy. Thinking that was the end of it I smiled at him, and turned to resume mopping the floor as he drove off. 10 seconds later I hear a voice through the window (I'd left it open) and see the man is back. He'd reversed back into the drive-thru, only to end up a good 10 feet away from the window. Yelling angrily about how I'd gotten the wrong donuts he proceeded to throw the donuts (still in baggy) at full force through the window, forcing me to snatch them out of mid air before they hit the wall and went everywhere.


I don't think I made a mistake with his order, and either way company policy said I was going to replace it anyways, but there was no reason for him to be such an ass about it. Throwing away the old order, I went and got the 2 new donuts that he requested and walked back to the window to find him standing there, having gotten out of the car. With a massive grin on my face, I handed him the donuts and asked ""What? You didn't want to catch?"" ",We're Not Playing Catch?,42

biddoodles,11,11,1qqyob,31,"**The Preface:**
So I work in a locally owned Italian restaurant as a server and have been there over a year. I've proven to my bosses and managers that I can handle my own sections, etc. Fridays are normally our busiest nights as we have a list of reservations and just as many walk-ins. On this particular night I'm given the back section, which contains two 6-tops, two 4-tops, and one 2-top.(#-tops is how many people a table can seat for those unfamiliar) The back section is also right beside Dishland and the bus room where we dump our dirty dishes. Alright, enough preface. Onto the revenge.

**The Setup:**
I'm in the back section tonight and I get sat back-to-back, so my section fills up quickly. I'm basically in catch-up mode at this point trying to meet all the demands of my tables. A family of 6 walks in and sits at my table. The head of the table, lets refer to him as Comb Over, takes it upon himself to hastily tell me they need their drinks and order taken asap. Normally, not a problem, but on a busy night, yeah bit of a problem. I'm rather busy already having been sat so quickly, and try and run around to get them their drinks and take their order. Not to mention, we're backed up in the kitchen because the orders are coming in out the ass. Go figure the entire table orders a different drink, so I have to prepare 5 separate drinks. I take their order and they want something changed in every item they order, sauce on side, light sauce, they want something substituted, yadda yadda. Basically every server's pain in the ass group.

**The Annoyance:**
CO decides to be a big shot tonight and flag me down every time someone at his table needs something instead of waiting 5 minutes for me to come around. CO stops me for every little thing so I can't get all of these things in bulk. Need a new fork because CO dropped his, need more water, a 2nd and 3rd Shirley Temple, want more coffee, more sugar, more water, creamer, this that, Ugh! They're chugging their drinks like fucking camels too and I still have 4 other tables I'm trying to keep happy as well. I counted up in my head and CO stopped me about 16 times, all before they even get their entree(approx 25 mins) and I'm fed up. I'm trying to clear dishes off of one table and CO stops me yet again, hands full of dirty dishes, to get him more coffee creamer. I say I will and walk past him to dump the dishes off in the bus room beside them. I come back empty handed and CO locks eyes with me, probably assuming I had forgotten and throws his hands in the air with a look of irritation. I walk by him on my way to the kitchen pissed at this point and grab a water for another table and a hand full of fucking creamer. I walk right out and slam down the handful of creamer and strut off.

**The Revenge:**
Just after that, their food shows up. I walk back and pass it out, asking if they need anything else. Surprise surprise, not a single person has something they need and no one will make eye contact with me. I walk off to tend to my other tables and ignore them until the end of the meal. I see that they have 2 coupons out and i walk over to take care of them, them only talking enough to explain which dish to put on which check. A smirk hits my face because with coupons I get to add gratuity (it's stated on the bottom of the coupon so they know this before they use it). I run their cards and sneak off to the kitchen and return with another coffee creamer. With a huge forced grin and the fakest 'Thanks for coming' I could muster, I pass out both checks and for CO's check I place a lovely coffee creamer on the top of the ticket.

I wanted to laugh so hard when I went back and smirked to myself in the kitchen.

Needless to say they complained that I was the worst server they've ever had. My manager understood how they were so I didn't get in trouble. Her response: ""Everyone needs to work in retail and food service just once to understand what they put us through."" I hope CO comes back and dreads his decision when he sees that I'm the one who gets to serve them again.",Would you like cream with that comb over?,42
oohfriedrice,3,12,1qqwlg,13,"**TL;DR: Fedora Wearing Douche Canoe causes the One Act Drama productions to have a huge amount of drama, so I tell him his essay is perfect even though it is a piece of shit with no main idea that didn't respond to the writing prompt.**

The yearly student directed one act drama productions began with a shit load of drama. After each director auditions everyone, all the directors fight for who they want to cast because it is un-ideal to cast one person in multiple shows. There is an unspoken rule of seniority. Note the word ""unspoken"". Directors who have directed before and are seniors have seniority and basically are allowed to cast whoever they want. Seniority is then given based on age, so if a senior director and junior director have a conflict over casting, the senior director gets who they want. Due to the dearth of males in drama, it was a fight to the death to cast the male you wanted. 

There are six directors: Awesome Girls (AG) who have directed twice before and are seniors, Drama Club President (DCP), Fedora wearing Ass Hat (FDAH) who caused this conflict, Girl who tries to mediate everything and fails, me, and Young Jew Sophmore (YJS). FDAH and his co-director (a senior) wrote their own one act while AG got theirs online. 

AG and FDAH want to cast the same male as their lead, but FDAH disregards the fact that AG has SENIORITY over him claiming his one act is the most important. Though AG present a perfectly valid argument about how it is their last year directing, FDAH says this is not a valid argument and says he should get said male. After 10 minutes of steam escaping from multiple peoples' ears, FDAH says he has to leave and study for a math test the following day and write an essay due the following day. He also says that he is content with casting (DCP) as his lead, relinquishing his hold on the male he had first wanted to cast.

DCP posts potential cast list online for everyone to see, and FDAH says he is casting the male actor he had given away to AG because ""he had yet to hear an argument that has persuaded him"". The guy does not get the unspoken rule of seniority; he just cares about himself.The resulting conversation resulted in a GINORMOUS timesink of 82 minutes, and I'm only at home for 180 minutes before internet shuts off. 

He further went on to say he was going to ask said male whose one act he wants to be in, which a) informs male about our inner troubles and b) puts him between a rock and a hard space. In order to justify his action, FDAH said "" If &lt;actors name&gt; wants to be in both casts,fine, if not, such is life"", yah FDAH thanks for screwing us over. Being that now the cast lists are far from complete, DCP proposes another meeting the next day. YAY, more time wasted in result of FDAH.

Not ten minutes after posting that he was taking the male actor, FDAH asks me if I can edit his essay as we are in the same literature class. Analysis of quotes from the book was needed in this essay to prove if the book should be banned or not, but sadly, FDAH did not get this memo. He used quotes from other sources that did nothing to prove his point. I told him his essay was perfect and that he would get A even though he did actually complete the essay prompt and had several items in his essay on the automatic zero list.

After a while everyone else in the room began to wonder what it was and started to look for it, but to no avail.  There were roughly 2 months left of school before summer break at this point and we would hang out in his room almost daily because he didn't have a roommate (no one had to get caught in the cross fire).  He quickly became infuriated at the beeping and buzzing and at least once dragged his mattress out to the lounge so he could sleep. He tore apart his room on multiple occasions looking for the source and even considered calling housing to see if they could fix the problem. The whole time I was really enjoying myself.

morganml,11,10,1qpivx,51,"Years ago, working in a little burger shack on Maui (one of the best jobs I ever had!) Just about closing time, and we're a man down, so there are only two of us in the store. One of the responsibilities of closing is, of course, taking out the trash. Here we run into a problem, as its against Policy to take the trash out alone, and against Policy to leave the store unattended. We opt, seeing as how the place is empty, except for one guy who is a non paying customer, checking his email, to take the trash out as quickly as possible, and rush back in. I see this guy every day, and we all know him fairly well. I take the keys out of the register and ask him to inform anyone coming in that someone will be back in two to three minutes to help them, and he gladly agrees to do so. Trash goes out, I come back in by myself and the other guy stays outside to mop the back deck. As I come in I hear a bit of commotion from the front, someone yelling, ""Where the hell is everybody?"" I walk through a door to the front, and the only person there is my webmail dude. (WebTV, thats how long ago this was.) He points to the other door leading back to the kitchen, says ""dude just went in there looking for you."" I go into the kitchen through that door as the guy looking to be served goes back out the other one. We repeat. Finding each other at last, I am left to be berated by this person for not being immediately available, and told hows he's friends with the owner, and helped ""build this damn place!""

I'm friends with the owner and built this place, and you are CHARGING ME!?!?!

Cursing at me, and in general just being a complete prick. I finished up his food, and went back to the register, pulled $16.42 out, and put it on the counter while I boxed up his food, after getting it all bagged and boxed nicely, I handed him his $16.42, and threw his dinner in the trash right in front of him. I told him he had to leave, as we were closing, and not to come back, as I was informing the rest of the crew not to serve him, ever. He leaves threatening all kinds of dire consequences, 'cause he's ""friends with the owner"" ""Once he knows how you were running this place, you'll be fired!"" I replied ""Do you SEE the owner? No? huh. Who do you think he put in charge? I'm here, and he is not, because he trusts me with his business, you go tell him anything you want, just get out of my store, before I call the police."" He left, foodless, and angry as hell cursing me the whole way. I should mention at this point, Maui closes at 9pm, being open till 10pm, we were literally the last option for food in town besides cold egg rolls from foodland, so its a good bet he went dinnerless that night. Best part of the whole thing, the webTV guy gets up, after watching all this, and says to me, ""Hey man, I have the same name as that guy, and that whole thing makes us look bad, you want me to go kick his ass?"" ""No, i said, but I'd love your phone number, so when my boss asks me about this, I can refer him to a customer that was here at the time.""

Enter Obnoxious Douchenozzle, or OD for short:  driving her little white 2-door Mazda - as I merged in to the fast lane, she apparently took offense to someone getting in front of her, and proceeded to speed up and ride my bumper.

She got so close to me that I couldn't even see her tail lights - and I'm in a small car myself, so that's quite a feat.  Step one:  clean the ol' windshield.  Yeah, OD got the splatter, and her wipers started going to take care of it.  Step two:  tap the breaks just long enough to make my brake lights turn on.  This, as you can imagine only pissed OD off - she turned on her high-beams.

I didn't care - I flipped my mirrors so that I wasn't being blinded and continued on my way - I had to be on this particular stretch for a good 15-20 miles.  I kept a safe distance between myself and the next car up the lane.  OD, on the other hand, was so far up my ass she could tell what eaten had for lunch.

Throwdeesnutsaways,183,265,1qp38r,1014,"I'm a Dungeon Master. KNEEL!

In my group of friends, the DM is responsible for the game itself and picking dinner. I fucking love lasagna and I cook it like I'm some variety of boss so one game weekend I cooked up a big ass lasagna. Of course everyone pitched in with money or a side, that's how the world works.

The house we play at is owned by the brother of a friend (BOAF) and he has a wife who I will abbreviate as DC. Figure for yourself what DC is, it's a choose your own adventure game with insults.

The lasagna had just come out of the over, it was cooling and it smelled and looked beautiful, the garlic bread is going in the oven and there chips and dip out, everyone has their beer and their smoke except me. I'm responsible for an entire fantasy world, I like to keep my wits about me. It also helps me catch them doing stupid shit so I can cleverly penalize them or reward them if they commit a failing-win but I digress.

We're out on the patio and DC is sitting just inside the back door on the couch. I was talking shop with the guys and somehow we were talking about how one of the hydraulic lift tables we use to transport caskets has a shitty wheel that gets jammed and makes subtle maneuvers difficult.

DC: Why don't you just fix it instead of crying about it?

I can ignore her, which she fucking hates, I can say I dunno how and appear incompetent which isn't really true anyways, or I can say the first thing that comes to my head, which she ended up fucking hating.

Me: Do you know how to repair every piece of equipment you use on the job?

DC: If you're gonna take that attitude with me then you can just leave.

I've heard stories. This wasn't a warning, this was her telling me to leave. Now. I already know the score but I'm the DM, the game doesn't happen without me and I brought the lasagna dish so if I go, it goes and these guys get stuck with garlic bread and chips and no game.

Me: Look, DC, sorry I snapped, that was rude of...

DC: I SAID GET OUT!

Chocks have been pulled, I am clear for take-off.

Me: Fine, but if I leave all these people here have no game, I can hold this game elsewhere and it's not like I don't have anywhere else to go, but if I leave you'd be ruining the night for everyone.

DC: Not my problem, BOAF, can I speak to you upstairs?

So I go collect my shit, my campaign module, my books, my dice, and I walk them out to my car. I come back in the house as she's walking back down stairs.

DC: I thought I told you...

I cut her off, she hates that too. Her alpha shit holds no power over me.

Me:Yeah yeah, I'm getting the rest of my shit.

DC: Well hurry up, I wanna eat and I'm not doing it with *YOU* here.

I laugh. I roar laughing. I had to stop moving because I was laughing so hard.

You see, she didn't know. She knew what was for dinner, but she had no idea whose dish it was, Who prepared it, anything. She had come downstairs after it was in the oven.

I grab the lasagna and she asks what I thought I was doing. With a big grin on my face I say...

""It's my dish, I prepared it, (name of other friend and his father) are going back to his place to eat it""

DC: ""Well cut me out a piece before you go.""

It must have been an opening weekend because it was particularly crowded for a Sunday night.  So we were driving around for a bit and finally found a spot.  I put on my blinker to signal my intent to take the spot, then wait for some pedestrians to pass the spot.  All of a sudden a car comes out of nowhere behind me on the left and snakes the spot as i begin to pull in.  I lay on the horn, and this chunky black girl gets out of the car and looks at me and says ""what you gonna do about it, I ain't moving"" and begins to walk off.

FredFltStn,51,321,1qou04,943,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**FREE STUFF -** I'm convinced that reddit is the best community on the net, and I'm trying to kick start Christmas by giving away free T-Shirts from my company. When you're done with this story, please read [this post](http://redd.it/1qn3fi) to find out how you can help out a child for Christmas and get a free shirt.


**STORY:**  In Florida, we get our fair share of rain, especially in the summer. During light showers, it’s business as usual, but when the wind and the rain really pick up, we batten down the hatches. We lower the sides of the tent and use plastic to cover any shelving or product that may be getting dripped on.

One afternoon, we got the typical fast moving heavy thunderstorm with wind, rain, and lightning. It really came up on us fast, and we had a load of people in the tent shopping at the time. I grabbed all of my help, and we went crazy trying to get all of the sides down and boxes off of the floor before stuff was ruined.

We managed to get everything down and covered before we had gotten much damage. We did however get totally soaked. 

while all of this was going on, my cashier was still ringing out customers, and new customers were running through the rain and lightning to get INTO the tent. No offense, but in a lighting storm, **I** don’t even want to be in a tent in a parking lot.

Of course, that’s about the time we lost power. It was early afternoon, so we didn’t really need lights inside of the tent, and I actually have my registers on small uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), so they don’t cut out every time the power fails. 

My cashier is still churning and burning trying to get people out of the door. About 30 minutes later, the power still hasn’t come back on, it’s still pouring outside, and the UPS’s give up the ghost and run out of juice.

Not a problem. I was a boy scout, and I have a backup plan for my backup plan. My parents RV has a generator, so I can switch over my critical power to that if I need to. It does require us to reroute some power cords and stuff like that, so I can’t just flip a switch and make it happen. but it's doable.

My dad and I brave the rain and wind to start getting stuff ready for the switch. While I’m out in the storm, one of my employees comes out to tell me that they need me in the tent.

At my counter, screaming at my cashier is uber bitch (UB). She’s pissed off that my cashier has refused to ring up her purchase, just because the registers are dead. My cashier was nicely trying to explain to her that the power should be on shortly, and they would ring her up as soon as possible, but UB didn’t want to hear about it.

This particular cashier had worked for me for five years or so at this point, and her father is one of my best friends. She’d actually graduated high school, and was home from college on summer break, working for me. I always joke with her that she’s the boss, and I’m just there to do her bidding.

My cashier is keeping her cool, but I felt bad for her so I stepped in to try and defuse the situation. UB demands to check out **NOW**, because she has somewhere that she needs to be, and I need to take care of it.

I’m soaked to the bone, and I just want to get this bitch out of my tent, so I pull out my phone and ring up her purchase on that. She actually had a pretty big purchase, and when I told her the total, she didn’t believe it. She wanted to see my phone to verify. She then went down the list of stuff, at least 30 items, and questioned each price. 

When she was doing this, she actually found a mistake I had made. I had entered in an item as $9.95 when it should have been $19.95. The only reason I knew this is that she was making me verify the price item by item as she called them out from my phone.

You should have seen the look on her face when it dawned on her that the only mistake she found was where I had UNDERCHARGED her. I grabbed my phone back and happily told her I would fix the price for her, and then gave her the new HIGHER total. I should mention that the entire time, there’s a crowd of people around watching the scene, and a couple of them started to openly laugh when this happened.

When I told her the new total, she lost her GD mind. She started screaming at me that it was my fault, and that she shouldn’t have to pay for my mistake. In fact, she should get a discount for having to wait so long. I let her yell for a good two or three minutes, just standing there expressionless.

I’m tired, I’m soaked to the bone, and my dad is outside in the rain trying to get the power switched over by himself because of this bitch. I called to one of my employees and told him to put her stuff back on the shelf, then I turned to uber bitch and told her, “You’re going to need to go somewhere else, because you’re not allowed to shop here anymore.”

I turned to my cashier, in front of the customer, and told her, “Don’t sell that bitch anything.”

She left, screaming obscenities and threats the entire way out and into the rain.

**ONE YEAR LATER**


The same cashier grabs me from the floor and points out a customer shopping in the tent. It’s the same uber Bitch lady that I had thrown out the year before, and she’s shopping with three or four other people. To be honest, even after seeing the lady, I didn’t place her face. If my cashier wouldn’t have recognized her, I’d have never noticed she was there.

**CASHIER:** What would you like me to do?

**ME:** It’s up to you. You’re the boss.

The lady and her party finished shopping and got in line at the counter to checkout. When UB got to the register, my petite 20 year old female cashier stood her gound, looked her dead in the eye, and told her, “I’m sorry, you may have forgotten, but you’re not allowed to shop here.”

Stone. Cold. Baby.

The lady actually walked out of the tent without saying a word. I think she was embarrassed because she was with a group. In the end, one of the people in the group paid for the stuff, and they walked out confused as hell.

k-squid,53,59,1qon92,313,"During the 8th grade, I met a boy the same age, but from another school. We became fast friends and started hanging out all the time. I even developed a bit of a crush on him, though nothing ever came of it.
When we got to high school, he started pulling away and hanging out with people who actively bullied me. He eventually began to slowly bully me as well. 

We had both been relatively disliked during previous school years, and this was not something I was unaccustomed too. However, I was finally coming out of my shell and decided to get some revenge. It was one thing to have classmates bully me simply because they didn't like me, but I'd had enough of people being my friend or pretending to be my friend and then turning on me.

I started small. I'd show up to his parents house bringing CDs or movies that he'd asked me to hold onto for him because he knew they wouldn't approve or tell them that I was worried that he may be falling into a bad crowd because I'd overheard some of his new friends talk about ""the pot"". That seemed to settle things for much of the school year. We just stopped talking or acknowledging each other in the halls.

Towards the end of our freshman year, he came up to me in the hallways and apologized for acting the way he had and said he hoped we could start over as friends over the summer. I didn't believe a word of it, but decided to play along. He said he and some friends were going to see a movie and asked if I wanted to come. I agreed, and he told me to meet them up at the front doors after I got my stuff. I didn't trust them, so I snuck out a back door and slowly made my way around the building in order to sneak a peek before making my approach. Sure enough, I saw them standing at the front door all with an armload of water balloons and laughing about how they were going to ""get that bitch"". I wasn't even that close, they just really were that loud and obnoxious. I was pretty pissed though, and immediately stormed back the way I had come, my plan for revenge already forming. 
At the beginning of the year, he had told me the combination to his locker. Hoping he wouldn't remember, I took the stairs two at a time up to the third floor. Luckily, everyone had gone already, leaving only me and my revenge. I opened his locker to find 4 of his textbooks inside. Being that it was the end of the year, there wasn't a lot of homework assigned. Before anyone could show up, I grabbed all 4 books and shoved them into my backpack before rushing down the stairs and out of the building. I always passed this small strip mall on my way home from school, so I made a detour to the back and tossed the textbooks into a dumpster.

zople,13,21,1qomjs,91,"Okay so a bit of a back story. I work at a University as a Technical Intern. The office I work in loans out cameras and other equipment to students. We often have students or staff come in and put posters up for events that they're hosting. I like to keep these posters up because they decorate my office and remind me of all the cool stuff that the students and staff do. Most of the people who put posters up are my friends anyway, as I used to study here as well. 

Anyway, there's this girl who comes in quite a bit and she's always moaning. The other day she came in and started moaning some crap about ""hating it when students put up posters and then don't come and take them down again."" She then decided to rip the posters off my wall, fold them up and put them in the bin. I kinda just sat watching her with a look of shock! How dare she rip down my posters in my office...?
So anyway, this girl is running for Enviromental Officer or something like that, all about saving trees etc.. so I can understand why she doesn't like posters. However, I keep seeing her posters up around campus (she's put that she will recycle them when she takes them down) so I keep ripping them down when I see them and putting them in the (recycle) bin (I'm not that mean!)

scordatura,48,87,1qnmdk,400,"One day I got called down to the office.   That was nothing new.   I used to skip class a fair bit, and do other things that teachers, the principal and vice-principal found very annoying.  I was in French class when I called called down.  That was great; I didn’t like French.  I had no facility for languages.  Either that, or I was just plain lazy.  Probably the latter.  So anyways, I got called down to the office.  Off I went, and sat on this bench in the outer area with the secretary, waiting to be called in.  

I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  I waited for forty-five fucking minutes, without being brought in to see the principal.   This was in the 70’s.  I had no smartphone to amuse me, and I hadn’t thought to bring a book.  So I was sitting there, bored as hell.  Finally I stood up, told the secretary I wasn’t going to wait anymore, and left in time for science class, a class I did happen to like.  I was curious about whether I’d get in trouble for not sticking around, but the funny thing is, I didn’t.  I didn’t even get called back.

When I realized I wasn’t going to get called back to the principal’s office, that really pissed me off.  It meant he’d been deliberately wasting my time.  Hitherto the principal had never been the direct target of my vengeance, but now he was squarely in my sights.  That night, I got to work.  Or rather, early the next morning, for it was 2 am when my alarm went off.  I jumped out of bed.  Time to call the principal at home!  I couldn't believe he’d be so stupid as to have a listed number.  

There was no call display in 1979.  There was no chance the call would be traced.  Unless the principal recognized my voice, there was not the slightest fucking chance I would ever be held to account.  So I rang the number, and after a few rings, the principal picked up.

“Who is this, and why are you calling at 2 am?”  said the principal, annoyed and puzzled.


“Mr. Pxxxx?” 

“Yes.  Now who are you?” he demanded, even more annoyed.

“Freen.”  I was keeping my words short.  Less chance of being identified.

“What??”

“Freen.”  I hung up.

A few nights later, I’d set my alarm again.  Same call.  Same word:  “Freen”.  Sometimes I’d call three nights in a row.  Then skip a few days.  Just to change things up, I’d call at the dinner hour.  Occasionally I’d call the principal at his office, from the payphone in the school’s entrance, just to keep him on his toes.  And always I’d say one word, and one word only:  “Freen”.

Now if you’re thinking that calling the principle at 2 am was my revenge, you’re very much mistaken.  There was a purpose to my calls.  I was waiting for my opportunity for real revenge, and after a month or so, I got my chance.  

One day I was sitting in the lunch room.  The lunch room was this tiny cramped converted classroom.  Small and crowded, and you weren’t allowed to be too noisy because there were classrooms down the hall and the teachers would get pissed if you yelled or something.  So here I was, munching a sandwich, when in walks the principle.  I don’t know why.  Maybe he wanted to speak to the teacher who was supervising that day.  Anyways, in he walks.  He was about ten feet away from me with his back to me.  And then, loudly and distinctly, I said,

“Freen.”

The principle whirled around in my direction.  But right after speaking, I’d shoved most of the sandwich in my mouth and started to chew.  He looked right at me, but I was the kid with his mouth full.  Had to be someone else.

“WHO SAID FREEN???” he shouted.  Utter silence descended.  He looked around some more.

“WHO SAID FREEN?  One of you said Freen, and I want to know who it was.  SO WHO SAID FREEN?”

The students all looked at each other with what today would be called WTF expressions.   After realizing he could not find out “WHO SAID FREEN”, the principle gave up, and stormed out.  People were too shocked to laugh.  We just looked at each other.  That day, word got around that the principal had a meltdown in the lunch room and was saying crazy shit.  


Of course I set my alarm when I got home that day.  At 2 am I made my call.  The principal answered.

This required me going to the back and loading up my pallet with whatever produce needed filling.

---

**Background:** My first job was a non-profit retirement home, we didn't offer assisted living or other end of life services.  For the most part, the residents were all in good health and lived active lives.  I worked in the food service area, starting as a busboy and progressing to waiter, head waiter, and then opting to move into the prep area as a dishwasher, and finally assistant line cook.

This is a story of my revenge on a coworker who refused to follow basic etiquette when I was a dishwasher.

---
**The Layout:** Coming from the dining room, the dishwasher bay was immediately the the right of the double-doors.  For those who aren't too familiar with a dish-room, it's pretty straightforward.  Waiters and busboys can empty trays of dirty plates, dishes, etc. onto a [flat metal shelf about three feet deep and five feet wide.  The shelf then bends away from the open bay and follows the inside wall](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Hobart-Commercial-DishWasher-Sys-w-Sink-Feed-Drain-table-R-to-L-Removed-/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/$\(KGrHqJ,!lQE-30EBRgGBP6wkVl(yQ~~60_12.JPG) where the dishwasher would store a bin for dirty utensils (this is important for later), as well as the huge double-sinks and finally the actual [dishwasher](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HOBART_DISHWASHER_2.JPG) where everything goes for a super-hot bath for about three to five minutes before exiting the machine and cooling off.

We had tried a number of different techniques to move the dishes through the system as quickly as we could to prevent running out of plates or glasses.  One of the rules that had stood the test of time was to have the busboys or servers take the food and scrap it into a huge bin before putting all the dirty stuff onto the shelf, and then to put the utensils into the bin to soak.

---

**The Setup:** One of the waiters was often in a rush (can't blame him, I'd been there before and understood that sometimes rushes happen.)  He would frequently scrape and then as he pushed the dirty plates onto the shelf, he would toss the spoons, knives, and forks into the bin of cleaning solution and water.  The resulting splash would then hit the dishwasher as he or she bent over the sinks and scrubbed the muck off the plates prior to putting them into the dish washing machine.

I had warned him a couple of times that it was disgusting and that he needed to watch his splash-back.  I presume he didn't think much of it, and probably presumed that I was all talk.

**The Revenge:** As luck would have it, this guy (let's call him Jake) and I ended up working the same night shift.  Just as the first wave of diners had finished, Jake comes rushing in with a tray full of plates.  He quickly dispatches with the food and paper waste before shoving the entire tray onto the shelf towards me, making a terrible crashing noise and knocking over glasses and whatnot that I had set aside to put into the machine.

I gave him a warning, but not ten minutes later he came in again with a ton of dirty dishes and chucked a hand full of utensils into the bin, splashing me with luke warm, dirty cleaning solution and food bits.  I grab the [power hose](http://crystalrayneauthor.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/100_3149.jpg) and with a quick jerk shot him square in the chest with about 8 ounces of water.  Soaking him through his apron, dress shirt, and undershirt in a second.  He was shocked, and with a smile I went back to work cleaning.  He couldn't find a clean/dry apron anywhere and ended up working the remaining three hours with a soaked shirt clinging to his chest before having to step out into a brisk New England January night to get home.

woahmanda8,94,971,1qmoi6,1973,"I was reminiscing on my past job today when I remembered a petty revenge story that occurred while I was working last summer. Before university, I worked at a children's birthday party place. It was an awesome job. Playing with kids, getting leftover pizza and cake, and the pay was way better than the minimum wage food service job I'm working now.

Anyways.
Two workers were assigned to each party. There was a lead and an assistant. Most people became leads after working for ~6 months and showing that you can handle the job and communicate well with the parents/kids. While both jobs were nearly the same, the lead got to do a few of the cooler things, such as introducing the rules to the kids before switching gyms (it was actually really fun, we would always make them play Simon Says to get their attention so they would line up), initiating the zipline, and cutting the cake. 

I was SO excited when I finally became a lead. Along with all that, there was a pay raise. It was great.

Here's where things get slightly annoying. There was this girl who worked there, we'll call her Carly, whose mom knew the manager. She worked there much longer than any of us. Like, years. She was known for leaving early, not doing her closing duties, sitting down on the job, etc. Just a general bad employee that none of us really liked because she made our job harder. She never became a lead. Although she was perpetually stuck being an assistant, she liked to play her own little game of trying to take over and act as a lead with the new leads. On multiple occasions I had to work with her, and each time she tried to line the kids up, start zipline without telling me, and one time she even tried to cut the cake. Hell no. (I made sure she didn't get to cut the cake, by the way. Cutting the cake was what I lived for.)

Anyways, one day she pulls out the zipline 15 minutes early. Without telling me. 

Me: ""Hey, it's kind of early for zipline.""

Carly: ""Well, I want to do it early today.""

Me: ""I don't know if that's a good idea, the kids will get bored later if-""

(Carly interrupts): ""Hey (birthday kid), do you want to do zipline?""

Of course, he says yes. Fine. I go with the flow.
Here's where it gets petty and revengy. Carly is a bit (well, moderately) overweight. She tires very easy. I mentioned above that she's often found sitting when we're supposed to be constantly active and energetic.

We start zipline, get all the kids lined up, I explain the rules. It was a large party, 25 kids or so. All around 6-7 years old. 

Me: ""Carly, since you wanted to do zipline, you can lead this one.""

The lead is responsible for holding the kids and running down the gym with them, the assistant only has to hold a rope. This is the worst part of being the lead. It's fucking exhausting having to hold multiple kids up and run to the opposite side of a large gym with them, especially because many of them don't hold onto the bar very tight and parents get pretty upset when you drop their kid. 

Carly: ""..okay.""

So, we go through 25 kids ziplining down a hot gym, and boy oh boy is Carly exhausted. She starts to tell me she's going to get water.

Carly: ""I'm gonna go get some water, I'll-""

Me: ""Wait, we're not done!""

Carly: ""What?""

Me: ""Hey, (birthday boy), do you want to go again?""

He, and all 24 of his 50 lb. friends get excited and get back in line to do the zipline again.

Carly: ""We're only supposed to give them one turn!""

Me: ""Well we started 15 minutes early, so we have plenty of time.""

Commence Carly's second workout of the day.

TheRandomHero,17,34,1qmh1e,193,"So, my ex-roommate was a dude my fiance had met through work. We had a buddy drop out of moving into an apartment with us at the last second, and we needed a roommate fast. This friend steps up to the task, and we were grateful. It took a few months for things to start going sour, and we started seeing his true colors of the type of person he really is.
  
So, he turns out to be a habitual liar and a slob. He did dishes once in a long while (no matter how many he used,) but would comment when no one else did them. His room smelled like a cross between a dumpster, and the smell that comes from a sponge that wasn't wrung out properly after use and has been sitting around for a while. Trash, empty beer bottles, dirty clothes, open containers; you name it, it was everywhere. He had no luck with ladies so all he did was complain about that, and then smoke/drink/whatever every minute he was home.
  
About 3-4 months of living with him, we notice we've seen things go missing. A few pinches of weed here, 20 bucks there. We would blame this on our lack of attention and possible mis-placement/mis-counting. We would keep cash in our dresser for rent (which was hundreds of dollars a month,) and one day I went to pay rent and it was short. I had just counted it the morning before, three times, and it was suddenly short...Now I'm suspicious.
  
So we blame ourselves, as he was so quick to do. ""You must have dropped it."" ""Did you miscount it?"" I reiterate that not only had I counted it twice, but I always had my fiance count money a third time to be safe with rent. Whatever, I covered it begrudgingly. Things like the mess, money missing, and such go on for another 2-3 months. At this point he's probably stolen around 100 dollars slowly from us. We go away to New York for a weekend in October, and come home and check our money out of paranoia. All of it is missing. Every. Cent. Gone. I'm talking all of our rent money.
  
So, no signs of forced entry. 2 dvd's were also missing, and none of my gaming stuff, guitars, or anything really worth stealing if you were breaking into an apartment is gone. I call this kid, furious, and tell him to get his ass home. As we wait for him my fiance calls my best friend over to calm me down/hold me back as I had been drinking and have no patience for this any longer. Plus, if I hit my roommate and the cops smelled alcohol on my breath I would be in deep shit.
  
He gets home and immediately goes on the defensive. He walks into his room and slams the door, coming out 5 minutes later claiming some of his things are missing. So we start calling the cops and he tries to talk us out of doing that. Maybe it was all misplaced? Maybe we're all mistaken? No? Shit...they're really calling the cops...
  
The officer gets there and questions all 4 of us (me, fiance, friend, and scumbag.) He quickly noticed the 3 innocent parties are standing, answering questions fully, and are making eye contact. The guilty party is sitting, staring off, sweating, and nervously rubbing his hands. He tells him he can confess and just pay back what he stole, or he can get his dust kit and dust our room for fingerprints. So the scumbag eventually breaks down and says he did it. Telling the officer he stole it for bill money (bullshit.) The cop tells him to pay it back, and we kick him out that night.
  
After a long week of shit, he's all moved out and we have that best friend I mention move in. Here's the petty revenge: I found this assholes blu-ray player remote in my living room drawer. I laughed and broke that son of a bitch in half with my bare hands and tossed it in the trash. I don't know if he could find another one, but it still felt nice to know he didn't have one anymore.

Prologue: The rental situation in this city is horrific, so I decide to save a little money by moving into a two-bedroom apartment with a friend of a friend. The situation begins to go south barely a month into our one year lease, with new roommate (let's call her Klepto) starting out by being just a little nuts, and progressing into stealing my things- clothes, money, cosmetics, even underwear.  And I don’t mean borrow without asking, I mean disappear into her clutches never to be seen again. Instead of taking the penalty for breaking my lease, I decide to wait out the rest of the year. I buy a lock for my bedroom door and move most of my things into my bedroom, except for sofa, TV, Blu-Ray, etc, which stay in the living room. 

The Story: In the final days of our lease we each begin to move out, when I come home from work and find Klepto’s things gone – along with my TV, Blu-Ray and everything else that she had had access to. Now, none of this was brand new stuff- most of it was my parent’s castoffs or second hand purchases- but there was no way I could afford to replace them. Also, I had no way to prove that these items were mine (second hand).  I knew it would be her word against mine, and when I called her demanding my things back this is exactly how it played out. 

The Revenge: This could have been the end of just another bad roommate story, but Klepto had left one last, precious thing to move out: her wedding dress. Klepto was getting married in two months. It was too good an opportunity to pass up, and The Dress went with me.  It didn’t take too long to get the first phone call. Over the next few days I ignored at least thirty phone calls from her. I was prepared to just trade for my things back, but then I got a registered letter from a lawyer, demanding the return of the dress. I really didn’t want to blow the issue up any further, so I got out her beautiful, delicate, designer lace dress and prepared to return it.  I stuffed it into the smallest box possible, about the size of a  shoe box. I could hear fabric ripping as I crammed it in. But that’s not it. I just so happened to have a friend that was headed to Europe, and was very happy to put the dress in her suitcase. When she arrived I had my friend send the dress Cash On Delivery. I can only imagine the look on Klepto’s face as she finally got her dress days before her wedding, and then not only had to pay for the delivery, but also needed to get it cleaned, pressed and prepared for her big day.

Turns out to be my mate, we’ll call him Cheap Skate. He’s drunk off his nut and asks if I have any cigarettes. I push past my annoyance that Cheap called on private specifically because he knew I was busy and wouldn’t have taken his call and tell him that yes I do but they aren’t mine I’m holding them for a mutual friend - we’ll call him Sober Driver -  who is trying to quit. He says he knows that because he’s with Sober now, in his car, they’re both outside my house and they’re both craving that nicotine. 

This pisses me off even more, the presumption that I would drop everything that I’m doing just to give Cheap the durries, but what can I do, he’s waiting outside my house with Sober, and I can’t refuse because they’re not mine.

I pull out my phone, call Cheap and ask him if he’s parked down the street, only for him to reply that he and Sober are still two minutes away. I asked him why the hell he said he was outside when he wasn’t and he replied that he “hates waiting”. At this point I’m bloody ropeable and start telling him exactly what I think of his bullshit, to which tells me to “stop being a whiny bitch, we’re almost there” and hangs up.

At this point I’m ready to go throw the pack of smokes away and to hell with that asshole, so I open the pack and see that there’s two left. One for both Cheap and Sober, almost like providence. I suppose it was in a way, because I know both of them hate sharing smokes (sometimes there just aint enough to around, especially nearing the end of a big night) so in one fell swoop I crushed up one of the two and threw it down the gutter next to my driveway.

Unfortunately, it is a rare occasion that I can actually do anything more subtle than verbally confront them.

So, Sister, Brother A, Dumb Ass Friend (DAF), and Little Niece pile into a van to go rescue Brother B from the clutches of NE Montana. Picking me up along the way, because why not... I love to travel.
It's a long drive. Stuck in a van with siblings I almost actively try to not spend a lot of time with... because a little tends goes a long way with them. Thanks to the wonders of headphones and books, the first leg of the journey passes without a whole lot of hassle.

I'm a little put off by the casual use, but don't get all hot and bothered over it. Conversation moves on and that's that. Time to make the 22+ hour drive back home.

But, in lieu of the comments still being made, I bypassed them all for neighborhoods of dominantly Black, Hispanic, or Asian residents. Forcing my brothers, sister, and their dumb friend to eat their fast food in as much petty discomfort as I could manage. While I sat in the van, enjoying the silence and munching on trail mix

starps,44,74,1qikja,238,"I was waiting my turn in the checkout line at the local grocery store the other day. While waiting I noticed that the cashier was really nice and patient with the older woman in front of me. But when it came to my turn in line and ringing up my groceries, the cashier didn't even acknowledge or look up at me (a first in checkout history for me!). She was impatient and unfriendly, a total 180 from the previous customer, and maybe she was just having a bad day, but it was strange that she just changed demeanor so suddenly!

At the end of the transaction, the cashiers are supposed to tell you about this survey on the receipt. While she was asking me about the receipt, she asked if I had ever used their fuel points before or filled out the survey. I said no. She looked at me sort of disgustedly and took on this huffy and condescending tone in her voice as she replied something about how I really should and didn't know why I hadn't yet. I then felt rushed out of line (the bagger had just left and I had been bagging my own groceries) while she helped the next person, so I had to scramble to finish packing everything. All in all, not the most ideal end to my shopping trip.

The revenge: Since I have a bit of free time tonight, I decided to take the survey online that she so adamantly wanted me to fill out. And I painstakingly detailed everything about my experience at the register and about how this negatively impacted my time at the store. I'm not sure if my comments will trickle down or affect this person or store in any way, but it sure made me feel good to be like, ""You want me to fill out your survey so badly? You wanna be rude? Yeah, I'll do it. And I'll be sure to mention you especially!""

watson540throwaway,7,21,1qiffa,72,"I'm a pharmacist, and also verbose. Apologies. Back in the day I used to work at a chain I'll call Wrong Aid, because fuck them. 

There was a woman and her preteen child who were both on Medicaid and filled with us regularly. To be fair, the kid had some medical issues that justified the government assistance, but the mom abused the system - decent car, nails done, designer purse, etc. I was especially irked when she took her kid in to urgent care with the specific intention of getting a prescription for an OTC antihistamine so she wouldn't have to shell out the $5 it would have cost to just buy it. 

But to the point: Medicaid in my state requires prior authorization from the MD for most brand name meds, which is a process that can take a few days. This woman would call upwards of 10 times a day and ask us to reprocess the claim every time we needed a PA for her kid.It got to the point where we'd have to politely ask her to call us at the end of the business day, which she would ignore. I finally told my techs to just pretend they were processing it every time she called before 5 PM, because between answering her calls and questions and reprocessing the claim multiple times a day, it would add up to hours wasted every time we had to get a PA on a med. 

I understood the reasoning behind her persistence for the more expensive meds, but there was one time she called every 30 minutes for a week straight to see if a prior auth for a $10 Rx only vitamin for her kid went through. Medicaid rejected the PA, so if she wanted it her only option was to pay the $10. As I said before, the kid's medical issues were fairly serious. But nope, if Medicaid wouldn't cover it, she didn't want it. 

Skip ahead a week or two. WonderMom comes in with an Rx for a weight loss drug that usually runs about $30 cash price. Medicaid also will not cover it. My techs had a certain discount card that would drop the price down to about $10, which they went ahead and ran for her. When it came down to me for verification, I noted the price and wondered if she'd pay $10 for the weight loss pill when she wouldn't cough it up for her kid's med. 

And then I had a better idea. 

I re-ran it for the cash price, $30 and some change. WonderMom comes to pick up and whines about the price for a bit. I'm giving my tech a ""don't you say a damn word"" stare the whole time, but eventually out comes the credit card and she walks out with her med. The kid's med was returned to stock. I got some interesting insight into her priorities that day and felt bad for the kid, but got some satisfaction from charging her $20 she didn't have to spend for the time she wasted.

TL;DR Woman calls my pharmacy repeatedly and wastes my time regarding an issue that was out of my hands, I make her pay $20 more than she had to for a weight loss drug when she wouldn't spend $10 on a med for her kid. ","Waste my time, I'll waste your money.",93

christein,5,24,1qgsh2,72,"TL;DR The gods of pettiness bestowed upon me the gift of light traffic and the opening of lanes

A friend and I are travelling home enjoying our drive, going about 10 miles over the speed limit. Beautiful night, traffic is light which is pretty rare for the place I live in. Que in clueless driver (CD). 

Now CD probably figured since the traffic was so light she didn't have to put a blinker on or check her blind-spot to see if anyone was in the next lane. Needless to say, she almost ran into me and I had to swerve into the next lane to avoid her hitting me. I honked and she matches speed to give me crazy eyes, so I just mouthed the word ""whoa"" Car pool lane opens up so I merge there just so I'm not next to crazy anymore. I guess she had other ideas.

CD decided she wanted to play the pettiness game. She swerves into the carpool lane rides my ass and puts on her high beams. She doesn't have anyone in her car, so i figure her plan was to make me get out of the car pool lane, then she'd get out as well and continue her harassment. Again, light traffic, so I decide, two can play at this game.

I had been cruising at 10 miles over the speed limit, but I had all the time in the world for her, so I slow down to about 10 miles under the speed limit. I mean, she does have her high beams on and I'd have to wait a few miles to be able to merge out of the car pool lane legally...I have to be safe if I can't see, right?  

I'm sure she's upset because she keeps trying to get closer and closer to my car, falls behind, gets closer again all the while I keep an even pace (thanks cruise control!). But alas all good things come to an end and I see that the car pool lane is getting backed up. So with a heavy heart I know I'll have to forfeit the game of petty.

What's this? Despite the double yellow, CD swerves out of the carpool lane speeds up swerves back into the carpool lane and in front of me. As she's about to slam on her breaks, the gods of petty decided to bless me this evening and the carpool lane finally opens up! I merge to the next lane and begin go back to my original speed of 10 miles over the speed limit. I pass her before she even realizes what I've done. My exit comes and with a smile and a wave I merge into the other lanes and make my way home.

**Background:** We're Korean and back in the 80s in Australia there were little to no Asians in the public schools. My aunt ""Sue"" was being harassed and teased by a girl and her friend. Just little things like pushing her around, bumping into her, saying racist comments (yelling things like ""Ching chong Chinese Ching Chong!"" and use their fingers to make their eyes slit/slant in the typical Asian eye way) and randomly laughing out loud as she would walk by (remember this detail!). This went on for a year or so. And one day she couldn't take it any more.

My aunt Sue has an English teacher, whom she likes, named Mrs. M. Mrs. M is also the headmistress and head of the English department. (She wanted to invite her to her wedding but lost contact and couldn't find her. She said she called numerous numbers on the white pages but to no avail)

**Revenge:** On the bus one day, these two girls were doing their usual harassing and Sue finally snapped and beat up the ring leader. Everyone on the bus was eye witness to this altercation. The girl yelled at Sue saying she was going to tell on her to the headmistress. Sue just shrugged and said, ""whatever, I don't care"", but inside she was scared shitless. 

The next day, Sue went to her English class and she's thinking, ""I'm going to be suspended for sure."" but Mrs. M was acting normal. The class went on like any other day and she started thinking ""I think I'm getting away with this!"". But at the end of the class Mrs. M said, ""Sue please see me during lunch time."" 

Well, she went to see Mrs. M and Mrs. M just asked her, ""Sue, what happened yesterday?"" Sue told her what those two girls would do to her everyday for a year and said that yesterday she finally snapped and beat her up. Mrs. M just said, ""Well don't let that happen again and if something like that happens to you come see me. Ok you can go now"". Sue was speechless. She couldn't believe that Mrs. M just let her go with just a small talk. The two girls were thinking she was going to be in huge trouble but little did they know...

As she went out to the corridor, Sue saw the two girls sitting close by, and before the girl (ring leader) could say anything, she went into her face and said, ""HA HA!"" and walked away.

I told him, calm down, don't be so high strung.  He snapped at me and told me to f*ck off.

Even better?  I won the march.  Not close, a bloody landslide.  I offered a handshake and a ""thanks for the games."". His response?  ""Not even."". I asked him what he problem was, if I did something to offend him.  ""You know what you did, you pretentious dick."".

Although he would frequently put on concerts, he never seemed to get any better at his job. He would constantly skip out on paying the musicians, book solo acts while advertising  as if the whole band would be playing, and rely on the acts to bring out the crowd.

Although that may not sound too bad, Ryan had one remaining flaw.

As the infamous Linus once said; “There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people: religion, politics, and the Great Pumpkin”. Sadly, the Great Pumpkin was the only thing in that list that Ryan seemed not too keen on discussing. While on Facebook, Ryan would constantly post statuses about his beliefs on feminism and many other social and political happenings. Now, don’t get me wrong. I’m not the kind of guy who really cares what one may post to Facebook or other forms of social media. In fact, Ryan’s statuses are possibly the only reason why I kept him around to begin with, and were always good for a chuckle.

The other day, instead of posting his regular status about females not being abused at their work place, he wrote a status about BitStrips and how he is going to delete anybody from his friends list who posts one.

scordatura,11,25,1qezdt,38,"I had the misfortune of going to this high school that was brand new.  My grade 9 class was the first.  Because this was a brand-new school, the principal decided that this was his chance to really make his mark.  To mold an entire school in his image, which he proceeded to do with tons of goddamn stupid pointless rules.  I only stayed at this fucking school for two years before I couldn't take it any more, but during those two years I took revenge on a regular basis.  I will share my tales with this subreddit if there's interest.  Tale 1 was posted earlier.  Here's tale 2.

A few months into grade 9, I was already pretty pissed off.  The school uniform.  The religious shit (it was a Catholic high school).  I think the thing that was bothering me the most at that time was the big fat zero I got on my ""Thomas More was no saint and deserved to be executed"" essay.  Zero?  Seriously?  More was a judge, and sentenced heretics to death.  They were subsequently burned alive.  So when the king chopped off his fucking head for treason, well done, I wrote.  But the teacher didn't share my view, and when I complained about the mark, the principal got really annoyed (because More was this catholic hero and saint etc etc) and gave me detention.  So now I was really pissed.

School was boring as hell anyways, and I learned lots more on my own, just screwing around with stuff and reading.  Sometimes I learned stuff that really helped in the mischief department.  For example, one afternoon I was at home, fiddling around with electrical shit in the garage.  I took an old broken kettle, and cut off the electrical cord.  I stripped the wires, plugged the cord in, and stuck the live wires into a jar of water.  The rather violent electrolysis was really neat to watch.  That is, until the wires crossed, with dramatic results.  A big spark, and a blown fuse.  Shit.  Ran out to the hardware store, bought a fuse and replaced it before mom and dad would find out.

The blown fuse thing was really neat. I wondered what possibilities this would have for school.   I took the kettle cord, and cut down the wires so they were much shorter.  Just a few inches.  I intertwined the wires and carefully covered them up with lots of electrical tape.    Voila!  An instant fuse blower.  I knew what to do next.

The next morning at school, I get there a little early as usual. Time to try my fuse blower.  I find an empty classroom.  Plug in the fuse blower.  Boom!  Lights out in that class.  I walk down a hallway.  No one looking. Plug in my fuse blower.  Boom!  No lights in the hall.  I did it in a few other places, and felt like I had this mighty superpower.  It was great.  The only problem was that this didn't really cause too much trouble.   Classes continued, teachers taught, and before the end of first period, the lights were all back on.  So from a mischief/revenge standpoint, not a lot was accomplished.

The weekend came, and I considered whether there was some way I could increase my fuse blowing mayhem.  Another trip to the store, a trip to the dump to do some garbage picking (needed some old appliances that I could cut the cords off of), and I was ready.  

By the end of Saturday, I had ten electrical cords to make ten fuse blowers.  That was good.  But even better, was I had appliance timers for each one of them.  I knew about these timers already; I had one in my room that clicked on the coffee pot each morning so that I had my own coffee ready for me when I woke up.  And I thought, ""Hey if I put these timers on these fuse blowers, then I can plug it in, walk away, and be nowhere near the thing when it goes off.  In fact, I can set up tons of them all over the place!""

And so that's what I did.  I waited of course until there was one of those goddamn boring as hell useless assembly things that included a fucking mass in the gym.  I hated church and disliked having to go to mass in my school.  So that morning, I set these things up in various places in an around the gym, and set the timers to go off just when I figured the priest would be droning on with the religious stuff.  

It was beautiful.  Priest is blabbing away, when suddenly some lights go off, and there's a bad smell (I'd put some match heads inside the fuse blowers before sealing them up).  They evacuate the fucking school.  Fire department called.  These firefighters go in.  Awesome.  But it got even better, because of course those diligent fire fighters quickly honed in on the problem.  They found the fucking fuse blowers.  I wish I could have seen the principal's reaction when he got the news.  I loved the fact that he  knew that there was a student who a) really really really pissed off, and b) didn't give a shit and c) would do whatever the fuck he wanted with impunity.

There was this announcement the next day about how what happened the day before wasn't funny no not at all and there could have been a fire and whoever did this was in real trouble and they knew who it was anyway so if he would turn himself in now they might give him a break blah blah blah.  I retired the fuse blower thing after that, but had lots of fun with other stuff.

i4ybrid,3,12,1qekky,26,"I let for a business trip yesterday, and I'm also going snowboarding on the weekend. I brought my boarding equipment packed up in a snowboard bag.

Once I get to the airport, I check in at the kiosk and talk to the ""helper"" who tells me she has no idea if I need to be charged extra for the snowboard bag. So as instructed, I got to the counter. The guy is not sure what to do with the snowboard bag either and calls over his coworker. They both briefly discuss it and they say they'll check it in as a surfboard. The guy looks me straight in the face and says cheerfully, ""Ok, sir that will be $150"" I hand over my card to him and go, ""Wait a second $150 for just the check in or for the whole trip??"" $150 to ship my snowboard! At this point, I'm thinking that's just not right. It's slightly longer, but it's not fragile and doesn't need special care. I ask about three times if he's sure, to which he says, ""yes, I'm sure.""

So I begrudgingly pay the $150 because at this point, what choice do I have? I'm thinking of UPS-ing my gear back home now. Once I get past security and sit down, I finally think to google search the airline's policy on snowboards. It turns out, my snowboard should have been checked as regular checked luggage unless it weighed more than 50 pounds. It was around 33 with all my gear in it.

Now, this is where my extremely petty revenge comes in. The flight I'm on is almost a full flight, and we're sure to run out of cabin space for carry-on. They ask if anyone is willing to check their bags. Normally, I would have checked my bag since I already had a bag checked. **BUT NOT TODAY!!!!** I took my bag onboard with me.

ktqueenofknots,9,19,1qek4k,0,"So I'm 20, my sister is 18, my grandmother is 75, and my grandfather is 79. I've been living between here and my parents' house since I was 15 before cutting ties with my parents this past April and my sister has lived here permanently for the past three or so years with occasional visits to my parents house.

Due to our violent upbringing manifesting itself in different ways, I'm more of the wallflower and doormat with a twist: my bipolar disorder leads to outbursts but I do take meds to control it. I try to treat people right and I help my grandparents whenever I can (aka whenever they let me). My sister, on the other hand, is five feet eight inches and ninety eight pounds of bitchy white entitlement issues. The world always revolves around her. She is never wrong. She is physically and emotionally abusive to my grandparents on a daily basis. My parents often pitted us against each other, so unfortunately my first instinct is to instigate her whenever I see her.

This is also the sister that fish hooked me a few weeks ago. that wound is still fading.

Anyway, last night I had a particularly rough night at work even though it was
supposed to be my day off, so I was sitting at my kitchen table eating some chicken my grandparents got from like one of those hot bars at the grocery store. aka it was all right but still meh. I was already on edge but trying to stay optimistic because if I let myself get down once I tend to fuck up my life for months. My sister bursts through the door with a gigantic plate of food, muttering under her breath about how she ""told that bitch"" (aka our mom) not to make her a plate, she hated our family, usual bs. I begin eye rolling because fucking seriously? I know our mom is an alcoholic abuse enabling asshole but it was nice of her to make her a plate so at least act grateful you stupid spoiled whore.

So I asked her what crawled up her ass and died. My grandparents have PTSD issues related to me and my sister arguing probably so my grandma was like DONT START but it already went to hell in a hand basket.

Thankfully it didn't get too physical but my sister called me a fat fuck. She also retracted her earlier claim that I could have the plate of food since she didn't like anything on it. I work my ass off.
I don't have time to eat, nor do I want to eat my grandparents' food because I was taken off their food stamps
so I'm trying to provide for myself. she hated 75% of the food on the plate, so it was just gonna sit in the fridge while
I contemplated if my mom's bangin cooking was worth the explosion that would result in me eating it until it spoiled, so it was purely a spite thing. 

so I was a fat fuck, then I was using my bipolar to get away with shit, my parents don't want me to come over for thanksgiving, then I was sleeping around with dudes for weed because I broke up with my boyfriend or something, etc usual lies.

so I went out for a bit to clear my
head, came back, waited till midnight when they were all asleep, and went upstairs in stealth mode and heated up that bitch's food in the microwave.

JDF211,27,46,1qeddq,98,"**Background:**
I have been parking on the opposite side of the street over the weekend. The reason I don't park on my side of the street is because the city leaf collection crew hasn't picked up my leaves yet. So there is a gargantuan pile of leaves in front of my house. I would pull further ahead but there is a fire hydrant. And to top it off I share a drive way with my Niebougher but it has a dumpster sitting in it making it unusable.


**Story**
So I parked on the opposite side of the street again today, after getting back from school. I'm parked right in front of this old man's house. He comes outside and waits for me to exit my car and asks what is wrong with the other side of the street. I calmly explained everything I sated in the above paragraph. He said it's common curtsy to not park in front of someones house that is not your own. Then he went on to say that it was no big deal. So I told him if it no big deal then why does he care? Then he said he would have my car towed if I didn't move it.


In case anyone cares I checked with the local PD and they said as long as I move the car every 24 hours I can keep it wherever I want on the street.


**The Revenge**
I am now parking in front of his house everyday even when the leaves get picked up I will still park there. When the dumpster is moved I will still park there. When my friends come to visit I will make sure they all park there too.",Threaten to tow my car?!,144
iluvweiners,8,16,1qeck9,59,"So My 7lb dachshund is the light of my life (hence my awesomely spelled username) and the bane of my existence, like many pets.  Most of the time he is just a less-than-smart, whiny little stinker who loves to cuddle. But I think this is an act, because he is a cunning little jerk who bides his time and waits for the moment to strike.

So I have been making these candy bouquets for our upcoming wedding, and we had bought a bunch of different lollipops when testing out some strategies. We had a few leftover blow pops and dum dums. We put them in a bag, up on a counter/shelf thingie. These were flavors I actively dislike, and my fiance isn't huge on sweets, so the bag has been sitting there for some time, only slowly going down in size. My dog, being 7lbs and about 2 inches off the ground, cannot get to said bag because he is small. But as I mentioned, he is cunning, and an opportunist.

We had an out of town guest staying over and brought the black trunk upstairs from the basement that contains extra bedding. This was probably three weeks ago, but we have had a slew of guests, so the trunk has stayed upstairs. slowly it has moved closer and closer to the counter/shelf thingie. Yesterday, we went to go see Ender's Game. Came back to find the bag torn to shreds and the sticks from the suckers scattered over the floor. All gone, except for the blueberry dum dum. Apparently, not even dogs like blueberry flavored suckers.

So I'm pissed, but after checking on Google that nothing bad will happen to my dog from eating the gum in the blow pop, there isn't much I can do. His smug little face and bloated tummy are resting comfortably on the couch. He convinces me to give him pets, and I do. I realize at this time he has lollipop stuck to his chest hairs. He was actually sticky in multiple places. Thus begins my plan of revenge. My dog HATES water. Hates it like a cat hates it.  This is a dachshund thing. They are one of the breeds really aversive to water. I probably could have just picked out the sticky bits if I wanted. But eat the candy? A bath you must endure! Muahaha

So I still fed him his dinner, because he needs vitamins, and we took him on his evening walk. Little jerk is thinking he got away with candy kidnapping and murder. But before bed I exacted my petty revenge in the form of a bath.  He was very unhappy. He wouldn't look at the camera, but you can tell that this is not an enjoyable pasttime: http://imgur.com/R58BgpL

I admit it! I lost my nerve after, and rewarded the bath with a carrot. Hey, I tried.

xXIJDIXx,14,18,1qeaon,42,"I was going to make this post short and sweet, but I decided to elaborate a bit.  I'm living with my girlfriend and her parents, and her brother and sister rent the apartment downstairs.  Now, her brother can be a real jerk, but he can also be a good guy.  He's had a beard for a long time, and today he shaved it down to a goatee.  I'm not sure if the ho-bag he's practically had living here (for reasons unknown other than she's a ho; she steals his weed and shit and causes drama, has friends over without asking when no one is there, etc., typical bitch) had anything to do with this or not, and he had been on my case about owing his parents a half a month of rent and staying here free (I have a job now, I was just having a rough time finding one), but this girl has been here free and causing problems. Also, a bit of a sidestory, my girlfriend and I have a suspicion her sister likes me. Anyway, back to the main story - I go to take my shower, and realize one of the razors I use is gone.  I have a Merkur for my face, and a cheap-o Target-brand razor for manscaping. I'm assuming (because of his lack of beard) her brother stole it, and not her sister (even though that would kind of make sense too because of how she apparently acts differently around me and takes interest in things and ideas I like and have, hence the suspected crush - but she has razors and I doubt she would steal mine out of perversion). Her parents are out of the question too because they could use it without my knowledge and not have to go through hiding it.  Guess which one was stolen?  Haha, the douche now has my balls all over his face.  Best part is, I shave before I wash.

TL;DR: Girlfriend's brother steals my crotch razor.  Self-contained petty revenge.

Edit:  Also learned the douchey bro is making his sister pay for rent when she just got a job, and he makes plenty more as a cook and wastes it on weed and booze and chicks.  Real stand-up guy.  Never letting him talk down to me again.  Stay tuned, I'm sure more petty revenge will be had.

Edit 2:  Also want to mention he doesn't want to get me a bag because I'm behind on rent with his parents (who are jobless at the moment) but his parents are behind on rent with their landlord and don't mind using the money I give them to go towards rent on bags they get from douchey bro, junk food, and presents.

Edit 3:  I confronted him about all this.  He's mad, says he wants to talk when he gets home.  He's just looking for a fight.  I'll just try to disarm the situation while defending myself, but if he throws the first punch he's not going to have much luck.

Edit 4:  Hopefully we'll just talk this over over a bowl and keep it civil.  He says I have some of my facts wrong - which isn't impossible, but it's improbable.  He said he ""borrowed"" the razor - but he could at least have left me a message, or brought it back up when it happened 2 days ago.",Stolen razor,60
EtherealWasteland,8,13,1qe4st,16,"A little back story:
About a year ago, one of my best friends, we'll call her Sarah, and I befriended this guy, Ben, that we worked with. Fast forward to this past summer, Ben confesses his feelings for me, I don't reciprocate, he calls me a slut along with a multitude of other things after making out with a guy at a party. Now, even though Sarah has always asked this of me, I never asked her to stop being friends with Ben. 

Fast forward again to last night. Sarah and her girlfriend (who will now be referred to as girlfriend, Jamie, who I knew long before they'd met let alone started dating, break up while I'm out with another friend. To be more specific, Sarah broke up with Jamie. Jamie then texts me about how upset she is, so I offer to take her on an adventure to cheer her up a bit, I just had to run home first. Now Sarah and I live together, so I figured she'd be there when I got home. This is the conversation that took place after I got home:

Sarah: You're home!

Me: Yeah, but we're leaving soon. Oh hey, where are your-

Sarah: Oh.. Where ya going?

Me: Oh, we're just going to go grab Jamie and take a drive

Sarah: Me.. Me and Jamie just broke up..

Me: Yeah, I know.. She told me about it. I'm sorry dude

Sarah: And you're still going? Thanks for being my best friend. 

Me: What was that?

Sarah: Nothing just go away and leave me alone. 

Me: Alright, well just remember I'm not remaining friends with someone who called you a slut and cussed you out in front of an entire party. 

So I left, agitated. But this was soon fixed, because walking out of the house I remembered that I was going to ask her for her keys when I got inside so I could turn the interior light of her car off. After that little episode, she got to wake up this morning with a dead battery. Mwahahaha.

Imalawyerkid,41,73,1qdzjn,207,"The day I turned 18 I got a job as a waiter at a chain restaurant with lots of stuff nailed to the walls.  I worked there until I graduated from college and loved it. A few stories stand out, this is one.

I had a table seated consisting of 2 obese teenagers, maybe 12 and 13, and their overweight grandmother.  After they were sat with their menus, the 2 boys immediately ask me for cokes.  OK, no big deal, that's my job and here you go.  I ask if they are ready to order, but the grandmother wants more time so I say OK and go do something else.

When I come back to take their order the 2 boys have already finished their soda and immediately ask for refills.  Sure, that was quick, and they still hadn't ordered, but here you go- what would you like to eat?  I take their order and off I go.

They ordered an appetizer and sure enough, when I brought it out, 2 empty coke glasses.  I would have brought the soda out as soon as I dropped the appetizer, but they just HAD to make it a point that they needed another refill.  OK, GAME ON. 

This table just happened to be right next to the soda machine, so it wasn't a great inconvenience to get 2 cokes for them. For the rest of the meal, every time I walked past the soda machine I would get 2 cokes and replace them with the glasses on the table.  Sometimes their drink was 1/2 finished, and I'd wait for them to suck down the rest so I could give them the fresh coke. 

By the end of the meal, I must have served them each the equivalent of 4 liters of regular coke.  When I drop off the check, I clear the table.  Grandma hands me a credit card and off I go.  I couldn't help myself, and just for good measure when I drop off the credit card to sign I also drop off 2 last cokes.

Now I don't care that he looks at other girls in real life or on tv. I do the same thing when I see an attractive man. But this time it was different. 

His eyes were glued to the tv. When I said his name he didn't even acknowledge me and you could practically see the drool in his wide open mouth. It basically felt like a slap in the face to be so blatant about it when I was sitting right there trying to find out what snack he wanted me to make for him, because he had asked for something to eat.

So I went back to my daughters's room to see if they wanted a snack as well. To my surprise both girls (age 7 and 10) were enjoying the same show.

I was stuck in the rather uncomfortable situation of having to live with my ex for a further 6 months after splitting up, to run down the lease on the house we were renting at the time. We had been in a rough patch for quite a while, however she secretly initiated an online relationship with some guy in the US she was talking to, and planned to head over there to knock boots with him that Christmas, without telling me where she was going or having the decency to split up with me first. Somewhat luckily for me, I suppose, I found out through some snooping that she was planning this before she got the opportunity to cheat on me. Anyway, enough back story.

Within a month of breaking up, I'd met someone else (my current fiance), but my ex made up a ""rule"" that my new GF couldn't come over to the house or stay over, even if my ex wasn't in that night. (Unluckily for her, I'm a lying bastard and broke that rule frequently.) She generally did her best to make the remaining months living with her infuriating in a great number of ways, inviting other randomers over she met from the internet without asking me and letting them stay alone in the house when neither of us were in, threatening to up sticks, leaving me to pay the rent by myself if I dared complain about any of her bullshit, etc., etc. I was more than sick of the sight of her by this point.

Now, time for the petty revenge I got to exact on her. I was doing a bit of pubic topiary with the kitchen scissors in the bathroom one evening before heading out to see the new GF. I finished up, left the bathroom, and put the scissors next to the sink to be washed up later. My ex-GF is cooking in the kitchen at this point, and asks ""are you done with those? Can I use them?"".

Quick as a flash, I respond, ""sure"", and within seconds, she's using those scissors to cut up some chicken for her dinner. In my head I'm just screaming ""HAHAHA, you're eating my pubes, bitch!!"".

Unfortunately I never got round to telling her this story before she moved out for good, nor the time my current GF and I did it on the dining table there. Ah well.

Some drama in the comments but I thought it was AMAZING petty revenge against a narcissistic parent.

&gt;Let me start by saying that the concept of gifts as a tool of joy for all involved is foreign to me.

&gt;Mothers day was approaching. My anxiety was building as I struggled to think of a present for my mother that I could both afford and she would like. I talked to my sisters about buying a gift for my mother as a group, a thing us children often did as we were children. My father would pay and we would help shop.

&gt;So my father comes to me with the day approaching, asking if I had bought a present for my mother yet. I said no, and explained that I thought we were going to buy it as a group. He becomes livid and starts yelling at me about how buying a present as a group is not the right thing, how I don't love my mother, how stupid I was for thinking we would buy a present as a group was, etc... I have some amnesia/I dissociated about the exact words.

&gt;I can't remember much about that weekend. I think I didn't buy anything for my mother, I might have stayed out of the house for a few days. Later he talked to the girls and found out there had been talk of buying in a group, so he made a half assed I'm-the-victim-I-didn't-know (SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED ME ASSHOLE ...excuse me) apology.

&gt;Father's day comes up shortly afterwards. The girls (mother and sisters) are buying him a present as a group! Me and my father were still on bad terms (Aka, playing the role of a parent, I hadn't allowed him to reform his child-like attachment to me). To fully rub his face in the disgusting and absurd event of that mother's day, I bought his present separate from the family. It was a horseshoe set. When I gave it to him, I brought up his violent tirade and abuse, and said I bought it not as a group to show I loved him.

&gt;He couldn't say that buying a gift in a group was something terrible like he had before, because his beloved daughters did just that. I could tell I had completely exposed him. I could see his inner child/true self come out, wounded, with no ability to build the narcissistic false self.

* Has no sense of hygiene and will pick his nose and fling it anywhere, cough on everything, not wash hands after a dump (he also blocked the toilet once and never fixed it) and never washes his stuff
* And also he is **never** wrong about anything (or so he thinks)

So after putting up for his shit for the last couple months and lack of respect for me and the flat I was close to breaking. Then one day after buying some cheese and telling him explicitly not to use it unless he was going to replace it with equally good cheese (it was expensive cheese for a student), I find a small chunk of it left in the fridge. I bought it the day before and barely used it. I asked my other flatmate but I had been with her when she was eating the last few days and i never saw 200g of cheese on any of her food. Whereas my flat mate had had macaroni cheese that night for dinner. Close and shut case? No.
He denies ever touching the cheese. Now I don't care if he did, its fucking cheese. But he denied it. He thought that I am stupid enough to believe that lie and that is what insults me. 

Now I've been lacking a little bit in maintenance *down there* so it's pretty hairy. So he luckily goes home this weekend and I seize my opportunity. He had just done a fresh laundry wash (first time ever using the washing machine) and I noticed a towel hanging out to dry. He only has one towel so I know he will definitely be using this one. I go grab his electric hair clippers and the towel and run to the bathroom. I set the towel down and get to work taming the monstrosity in my pants.

I finish up and it looks marvellous, hair everywhere, but it looks too obvious. So I shake some of the more noticeable hair off leaving just tiny little fragments that you'd need to be looking for to find them, hang the towel back up and put the clippers back in his room. Now something that grew out of my balls is ingrained in his towel and hair trimmers and it gives me deep satisfaction when I see that he has used either of them.

TL;DR flatmate is a dick, gets my sack hair on his stuff

Apparently the restaurant was to host a wedding banquet shortly after we had arrived. We noticed right away that they were short on supplies - for example we ordered lobster but only got about half the number of the little forks to eat them with as we had people at the table.

As we began to finish our food, waiters began to try cleaning up our table *while we were still sitting there*. Eventually, somebody pulled a teacup straight out of my uncle's hand. Normally, my uncle is a very quiet guy, but I guess this was the straw that broke the camel's back.

He went on a rage about having his tea swiped from him - he was clearly not done drinking it. The person who took it from then tried to apologize and put the teacup back on the table in front of him. To which my uncle yelled ""I saw your fingers go into this tea when you took it! I demand a new cup!""

My uncle's request was granted, nobody dared to take anyone else's teacup away, and we decided to take as long as we felt necessary quietly sipping away.

I moved into my house a few years ago, but before I could move in the foundation needed slight repair. The houses in our neighborhood are pretty close, so the construction company asked both neighbors if they had permission to kill the lawn to complete their tasks. Both neighbors agreed &amp; construction finished.

The Bad Neighbor (BN)'s sued the construction company in small claims for $6k to place sod in November due to the destroyed grass. I had already planted new grass &amp; spent $400 on top soil prior to the suit, but she didn't care. The construction company she sued just so happened to be my cousins doing the project as a favor to my family for cheap. She had traction with her suit, because the non-house owner / ex husband was the person that gave permission (they were committing Medicare/Medicaid fraud bc he was ill). She knew it and just wanted to make sure everybody knew she was a b**ch. They settled for about $300, but she definitely hadn't started out in the right foot!

The neighbor on the other side of my house is one of the nicest people, but  intolerant of other ppl being disrespectful. I refer to her as the good neighbor (GN). BN's loser daughter got into a misunderstanding about a year ago with GN, and now every day she passes GN's house she flips her the bird. .... And so does her kids. She's the epitome of trailer park trash. And what's worse, her trash babies take after her like crazy.

For a very small snippet of background, BN babysits her daughters kids, but she can't be bothered to get out of her car to pick them up. Instead of being a good neighbor / upstanding citizen, the cow loves to honk nightly &amp; incessantly until her hell spawn ooze out of BN's house. BN's daughter sometimes likes to stay (rare) when BN cooks and/or smokes pot, and today was one of those days. When she comes over, she inexplicably has to park in front of my house instead of BN's house.

Yesterday we had a pretty bad / windy day and had more leaves than normal to clean up. I utilize a leaf blower and start back to front. I got to her car in front of my house, and it was in my way. BN's daughter now has a nice pile of leaves all over her newer car. Bonus is that she just cleaned it not too long ago.

nshipma1,132,216,1qbg0z,454,"a few years ago i went to north carolina for a wedding, and while there my then boyfriend (now husband) and i visited a local brewery. it was quite small, so they don't distribute or even bottle. we did a tasting, and afterward bought a growler that was awesome (cool top, slightly bigger than normal growlers, and unique since it's a brewery no one has heard of). it was an awesome wedding and fun weekend, so i have good memories attached to this growler. in addition, i used to use it to fill up at local breweries near my house, because it is slightly bigger than normal growlers but the breweries would fill it up for the same price. so i had stickers and stuff from these breweries all over it. 

well, i have a friend who did not own a growler. because i have three, i offered to loan him my growler until he got his own. i gave absolutely no indication that he could keep it and was very clear that it was a loaner til he got his own.

fast forward a few months, and we decided to go get beer together at a brewery in our town and both bring our growlers. as soon as we get there, i see he has ripped all the labels/stickers on the growler off so you can't even see where it is from anymore. i was more than upset because i didn't understand why he would do this to someone else's property, but i'm very bad with confrontation so i didn't mention anything. i know i should have, but at that point the damage was done and i didn't even want it back anymore since it lost all of its uniqueness. 

fast forward another few weeks, and he finally does buy a new growler. first thing he does is post a pic on facebook of his new growler and MINE, with the caption: i now have a growler collection.

acupoftea,10,21,1qas84,51,"This will be a little long, but here it goes. I do have a TDLR at bottom. I work at a worldwide steakhouse chain. Normally the customer base is friendly and understanding. Every once in a while, you'll have the duds. 

So it's a busy Saturday night. I'm running a three table section and they happen to all be very close. No big deal. They arrive in the middle of the rush. A husband and wife and their teenage daughter. I will call them ""Table B"" I put on my smile and try to get their drink orders. The wife can't decide. We discuss different drinks and prices. We finally settle on a drink and move on. They decide to give me their order there, which I don't mind since makes my tables turn over faster. But they didn't know what they wanted... The wife, again, couldn't decide, and ended up changing her order twice. Finally a decision is made and I get everything I need and am able to leave the table. 

It is my first visit to Table B and I have already been there a little over 15 minutes. By the time I was able to walk away, both of my tables are already finished eating and are waiting patiently for me to bring the check. I immediately apologize for the wait and they are understanding. So I go to our computers and put in Table B's appetizer, since it's common procedure to put main entrees in after the app has arrived. I bring them their drinks then drop checks off and pick up payments from my other two tables. As I'm dropping off a credit card receipt and offering to-go drinks to my table directly next to Table B, the husband turns around and says, ""Can we get some more bread?"" He interrupts me mid-sentence at another table. Now, I am livid. But I put on my happy face and ask him to give me one moment please. Now it's on!

I eventually bring him the bread, without bringing extra butter. I thought this was going to be as petty as I could get. But it got much better. After eating half of it, they complained that their appetizer was too greasy. My manager offered another different appetizer but the wife, once again, could not decide which one she wanted and opted for a free dessert instead. 

Someone else ran their salad to them. When I came to check I noticed the dressing was wrong. I check my ticket and realize I must've accidentally put a different dressing. The computers are older and the touchscreen is a little off on certain ones. Oh, well. He doesn't realize it so I don't fix it. He even asked for extra dressing. 

Of course, he also needed tomatoes and an extra napkin as well but he chose to tell me one thing he needed at a time causing me to have to go to and from his table 3 times in a row. He was being rude with me, the wife was short. My favorite person is the daughter who kept to herself on her phone except when she very politely asked for a refill. I'm basically just waiting for this table to leave. 

Now when it comes to the desserts, the wife has no trouble choosing what she wants this time. She want's our biggest dessert, which is basically all our desserts in one. Even my manager rolled his eyes as he had to comp it. Right before I bring it out, I realize I forgot to ask what topping they want for their cake. I call for two sides of each topping instead of going to ask, figuring they can just have both. The cook doesn't have time to make them right away. Well, their ice cream is starting to melt more and more and I decide to just take it. No topping for them, today I guess! 

Why is it any surprise to me when they ask for a to-go box so they can take it home? I have no idea. I had already ran their check and know they tipped me 6% despite getting nearly $20 taken off their bill, and having a gift card that took another half off. I was feeling particularly finished with them after that, but they asked for a bag and I had to get it for them.

The last petty revenge of the night. I knew it would be great. We only have two to-go bags and each are pretty big. They are paper sacks so they are very boxy. One is reasonable while another is downright huge and only used for large to-go orders. I look at both and decide to go ahead and just grab the biggest one. And with one last fake smile, I handed it to them and went to retrieve another order's table. From the corner of my eye, I could see that the bag was so big he had to open it in the aisle just to put his boxes in it because it wouldn't fit anywhere else. Deal with that inconvenience!

**TL;DR!**
**I cause a rude table's night to be not as enjoyable as it could be by:**

**1. Not giving them extra butter.**

**2. Accidentally switching dressings but not mentioning it.**

**3. Making them eat plain cake.**

**4. Giving them an oversize paper bag for their to-go boxes.**

**Best part is, they don't really realize it. So I don't have to feel guilty.**

There actually wasn't any, but he decided to tell her that there was a huge assignment, and picked the longest most complicated problems he could find in the book to tell her to do. She proceeded to tell all her friends so they would not lose points, and 5 of them spent hours trying to finish the insane assignment before it was due (generally assignments were due on friday and he gave them the false problems on thursday)

KevinSun242,1,10,1qaa65,53,"Been lurking this subreddit for quite a while. Finally think I can post something here :P

So, a bit of background:

I work at a supermarket as a bagger, but I've just recently been made a cashier as well.

So today, I was ringing up a woman who had WICs (like food stamps, but for women who have young children), and she was a very polite, pleasant customer. WICs are very stringent on the brand and type of items you can get, so of course, there will often be problems during checkout. For example, in my case, items ringing up that are not approved.


The customer behind, however, was complaining, in a volume that at least I could hear on the phone, about how long she had to wait. But what sealed it for me was that she actually turned to a customer behind her and started complaining, (all in earshot of me, and likely the WIC recipient) and when I gave her my typical ""Hi, how are you?"" greeting, she rudely replies ""Don't ask.""


I made sure her groceries were scanned at a slower pace. Since she paid with a credit card, I suppose I should have hit the ""Resign"" button by ""accident"" and made her sign the pin pad again. Was also tempted to double scan an item just to call over a manager / assistant manager to void it out.

**TL;DR: Lady complains all around about waiting for more than a couple of minutes, I scan her groceries slowly.**

trashedlikeoscar,11,19,1qa1um,23,"I was working in the ER as a nurse and came in to a patient awaiting hospital admission for ""Chest Pain"".  This patient was a known drug seeker, ER abuser, and would call frequently for morphine for her chest pain.  

The admitting doctor had ordered a nitroglycerin drip and given orders to titrate it up to alleviate her chest pain along with a separate order for morphine. The Nitro had been running all night on the lowest setting, and she was asleep on my arrival. 

When she woke up and inevitably rang the call bell with her complaint of chest pain I turned up her nitro drip as ordered.  General whininess and a headache ensued.  

She eventually got her morphine, but not without a side dish of whopping nitro headache.  I didn't titrate the drip down either.  I mean her blood pressure was good and her chest pain was unrelieved. I was only trying to help.",Clog up the ER where I work? Enjoy your headache.,42

Nyemenya,2,12,1qa0wq,0,"2 stories because I came to tell my 8 yr old daughters story, and remembered my 12 yr old's story.

8 yr old ""L"" was in a race today around a lake.  It was a city-wide thing and they took the kids by grade then gender.  So 3rd grade girls had to wait a while sitting with their group, parents had to sit around the roped off kids area.  2 times L comes to me, the last time in tears, because Sally was putting grass in her hair and then kept moving and sitting on L's towel to sit in between L and her Best-friend-in-the-WHOLE-world.  Then Sally hit her.  No parents saw it, her eye was a little red, mine were about to blow.
I told L in a fit of -Nobody hurts my baby- to tell Sally to back it off, leave her alone and shut the fuck up. I felt bad about saying fuck, but L says (knowing me) ""Ok, but, hehe, I wont say f hehe"".  I know you wont.   
She goes back over bumps this girl out of the way and proceeds to ignore her.  Sally picks another kid, and THANK ALL THE GODS 3rd graders were called up.
So her petty revenge as she told me afterwards she planned:
She hauled ass around the .65 mile lake (going very uphill at one point) having one college guy (volunteers) running along with her, and made sure to keep check where Sally was.  L came in 15th, sally came in 30th.  I have one picture where she was running almost to the end with her hands in the air and she was saying ""I showed her Mom!""

Now this is just your standard crosswalk, and we all know that you can't start walking across the road until the light turns green and the little hand turns into a walking man.

Anyway, I walk up to the crosswalk and stop before the road and wait for the light to turn like a normal human being. There's this girl beside me, who must be in the biggest rush of her life because she just can't wait to cross the street, so what does she do? Right as the light turns yellow on the other set of lights, she starts walking. Now as you can imagine this has me infuriated. What gives her the right to disobey the rules of the road? She's about 1/4 of the way through the crosswalk when the light turns green and I have permission to walk, so I speedwalk right past this girl and make it to the other side before she does.

We think, great, there's only one person in line so we walk around (there's a bar indicating where the line should start) to get behind her.  Well, as we stood there, this woman with her kid walks in and stands behind the woman of 4, outside of the indicated line with the intention of cutting in front of me and the customer standing behind me and my bf.  When the family of 4 leave, I just shove my way in front of her with a mental 'fuck you' and take my order.  She knew what she was doing was wrong so she didn't complain and instead, cut in line behind me.

After finishing my coffee we start to head home.  We were in the car, waiting in line to get out of the plaza turning right at a T intersection.  The light was about to turn green for us with a white car turning left into the plaza.  Well, a green car coming in the opposite direction sped through the light and completely rips the back bumper off of the white car, damaging their own front bumper with a headlight hanging out.  Because of the positioning of the cars, the person in the green car figures the person in the white car can't see their license plate and goes speeding off.

Now, I've been in an accident where a person did a hit and run on me before.  Witnessing this happen in front of my eyes got my blood boiling.  Thankfully, because the green car was heading in the same direction as us we were able to follow.  It was hard as they were speeding over the limit and we didn't want to do that and we even almost lost them at a red light they sped through, but thankfully there was traffic at the next light and we were able to take down the license plate number and report it to the police.

I was pretty pissed, as I didn't want the smell of stinky drunk sex in my room. So when I could tell it was getting heated(screamer this girl was) I jumped in and yelled, ""Can I join in?!""

About 2 years ago, I was away at school, about 4 hours away from home. I went out one night, and this young gentleman was begging to buy me a drink and for my number. I said I wasn't interested and solely wanted to be with my friends. He didnt back down. On another night, he proceeded to grab my friends titty, and then had the audacity to try and grab my arm for a dance. I pulled away in front of a load of people and said ""Don't you dare touch me!"" He was embarrassed and started shouting slander that I was just an asian girl that was a racist...
I dont know how, but he got my number, found my facebook, found my address. He harrassed me with texts, showing up at my place and shouting at my window. Turns out he went to the same university as me, and since it was such a tight knit community, it was easy to know someone who knows someone. Game on motherfucker.
What did I do? I called my mom. I'm the youngest of the family, and thick as thieves. She drove up 4 hours for a weekend to help me. 
He texted me every night, so the night my mom arrived was no different. He texted me. I called him and told him to come over. He was elated. Dense idiot. When he arrived at my apartment, my mom grabbed him by the ear, sat him down, called his parents.

itsjusttoored,29,35,1q98rm,51,"So, a few months ago, dating this girl, all is great. Got invited to a party at my friend's, bring her along, best friend is there too, everything is still great. All my friends love her, and she makes friends fast.

All is quiet for the next week or so from her, then I'm dumped. Find out a few months later that my girlfriend and best friend were cheating and have been dating for the past few months, and all my friends knew but didn't tell me (will get to them later). Naturally, I am slightly angry.

So, started Sixth Form a week after I found out, and we have new people in our group of friends - ex-best friend is still hanging around, and I am ignoring the shit out of him.  Whilst still dating my ex, he begins flirting with one of the new girls - trying to kiss her and stuff, then it gets more serious; she goes and sits somewhere else not next to him for a few minutes, he starts telling her he wants to die and self-harming in the middle of break. Obviously very distressing to her.

So, this is part revenge, part protecting my new friend. Spent a lot more time with new people, so they like me more than him. Told my ex about what he'd been doing with the new girl (later denied to her by one of my old 'friends' who knew, but doesn't matter here). Long story short; my ex no longer trusts him completely, the new people do not like him after I told them that he'd been dating someone whilst flirting with the new friend, my old friends are trying to be bipartisan in a way and are slowly rejecting him to 'appease' me after I acted a little emotional over the phone to one of them; I barely see him around anymore now. And he can't go anywhere near the girl he tried flirting with or he's automatically seen as flirting and his girlfriend finds out.

One day, this man was driving around with his family in tow, completing errands. One of these errands happened to require the local bank.

Now, this being a fairly busy day, the line was long enough to warrant a decent 5 to 10 minute wait. Slowly, and patiently, this man waited his turn, until finally he was next in line.

Now, as the man was a gentleman and respectable, although a bit irate, replied to the Officer, ""Lieutenant, your demeanor is unbecoming, but you seam to be in a hurry. Please, go right ahead."" while making note of the name-tag.

The Officer, with a quick retort, responded dismissively, completed his transaction without further occurrence, stormed out of the bank.

Finally, the man, having completed his transactions, departed and went back to his awaiting family in his vehicle. As was often the case with this man, it was clear that something had perturbed him and he was most irate. The wife, picking up on his mood, asked what had peeved him so. Upon relating the story, they shrugged it off for the day and finished their errands.

oldbrownshoes,12,10,1q706y,23,"Been lurking on reddit for a few weeks. Finally decided to post something. Here goes, hope I don't violate any unwritten rules!

A year ago my SO and I went to a wedding in another province (east coast). The reception was at the hotel we were staying at. As things were winding down a bunch of us decide to keep going. We bring maybe 10 people back to our room. It was a little rowdy but not crazy. Not 10 minutes later there's a knock at the door. It was hotel security and our neighbor who called them. He was a short stocky guy (SSG from here) who you could tell worked out and wanted to show us how tough he was. security said we were being too loud and had to put an end to things. No problem, everyone was really nice about it, I was sobering by this point so I was ready for bed anyway. We apologized to SSG and security and everyone began vacating. SSG was not having it. He was incredibly belligerent and physically threatening. In my room were a few East Coast Boys (big, burly, friendly as hell. If you're from there you know what I mean) just trying to apologize and end things nicely. Never did happen. SSG continued shouting/trying to fight with everyone while they left using security as a shield of course. Just a very unpleasant/scary experience that could have gone bad but no one let it escalate thankfully.

Next morning, my SO and I had to leave early. As we were walking out, we passed by SSG's room. Without stopping I grabbed the 'Do Not Disturb' sign off his door and threw it away. Hope he enjoyed his early wake up!

tattooed_tragedy,7,20,1q6zz5,41,"I was working at a mid-level sushi restaurant a couple of years ago - it had the restaurant on one side and a bar on the other. I don't know what got into him, but one night when my server/friend Joe (name changed) came to the bar to pick drinks for a table he playfully slapped me in the face. I got angry and told him not to do that. The next time he came to get drinks, he did the same thing.

So I snuck out to the parking lot and let the air out of the driver's side tires of his truck. Not the most mature thing, I know.

End of the night, he discovers the state of his tires and returns to the restaurant. I overhear him telling our manager about it. Since there's a gas station with an air pump in our parking lot, not 100 yards from his truck, I figured he'd drive over and pump them up. It would be slightly inconvenient for him. Just what I was looking for.

Well, it got a little out of hand from there. Apparently he ran over something on the freeway on his way to work and thought the flat tires were a result of that. He ended up getting his truck towed and the tires replaced.

It's been seven years and I still haven't told him.

GreysonHalstead,15,14,1q6y7h,35,"I am a 29 year old woman in the professional business world, and as such, I keep my nails trimmed relatively short, painted and manicured at all times, but I usually do it myself. 

Well when the seasons change my nails always go through a breaking phase, and I usually will go to the salon and have acrylic put over my nails to just strengthen them a bit while they grow out. 

So last night, after work, I decided to go ahead and get it done, since I'd broken no less than four nails yesterday, and my hands were looking pretty haggard.

I moved to my city in January of this year and have not had fake nails put on in that time, so I went to a local salon that I had heard good things about. Yeah. No.

My manicurist was a nice older gentleman, who was very personable, but did the worst nails I have ever had, even after I told him three ties exactly how I wanted them. He cut them too short, flared the tips, lifted the edges, the tips were uneven, my thumbs look like I have chiclets on them, he flooded my cuticles with polish, and never evened it out.

I had taken out my credit card when I got there, so that I wouldn't have to pull it out of my wallet and risk smudging my nails when he was done. I showed him my card before he started on my nails and said, ""Go ahead and run it when you're done."" 

When I was drying my nails at the UV bar, he laid my wallet, coat, phone and purse beside me. Great. When I was done, I picked up my things, bid them goodnight and left. I was upset at how bad my nails looked and was frustrated, but it was my fault for not thoroughly researching the place.

This morning I was checking my bank balance and I noticed they never charged me, and thinking back I realized when he put my stuff beside me at the drying bar, he had not taken my card to run it and I had not signed anything.

Now I am the type of person that if I buy groceries, get to my car and notice something I missed at the checkout stand, I take it back inside the store and pay for it. I am an extremely honest person. But in this case I feel like I got what I paid for, which is nothing.

Alright, so there was another time in fat gym when someone was being a jackass. This one kid, he was one of only a couple of actually fat kids in the class, was kicking ass while we were playing soccer another day. The thing is, the only reason he was winning was because he'd use his girth to push around the smaller kids and basically storm his way across the room. Nobody there was really motivated enough to do anything about it and he started to build this superiority complex. He would walk up to the other teams waiting for their turn and do the truffle shuffle in their faces and this one time he actually just sat on the ball in the middle of the field and dragged his way into the opposing team's net. At that point he shouted I AM THE MASTER OF THE BALLS and then it was our team's turn.

The ball was rolling towards me and fat guy started jogging towards it, slowly crouching to squat on the ball again. I saw him coming, so I kicked the ball up and it nailed him right between the crouched legs. HARD.

I keep a box of Oreos in my room which I dunk with milk every morning. Recently I noticed that my Oreos have been disappearing whenever I left for class. So I suspected one of the girls of stealing them. One day, my maths class was canceled so I went home to take a nap with the little time I have nowadays. I saw Anne come out of my room with a glass of milk, but she denied ever eating my Oreos. I got angry at her for lying and plotted my most petty revenge.

Before eating dinner, it is a Vietnamese ritual (I hope) to “invite” everyone to the meal. My roommates and I “mời” each other to eat.

I reminded my boyfriend last night that he needed to pull the bin out before he left for work (one of the few chores he actually does) and in particular today as there is a GIANT spider living on it somewhere and he knows how scared I am of them. He said fine. This morning, he was going into work slightly earlier than usual, and I was getting up slightly later, so I was half asleep when he said bye and forgot to remind him.

I get up a bit later, look outside, bin still sitting by the house. I know for a fact he will use two excuses for this. One, it was early, two, I didn't remind him. Neither is acceptable to me as I still manage to do things that need doing, and I'm usually up much earlier than him.

jared9929,2,9,1q6054,34,"**Background**

Back in my high school AP Computer Science class, we got put into groups for our end of the year code project. Our task was simple: make a game from scratch, and assign each person a part of the code to write.

Well, I got mostly lucky with my group. 3 guys who knew what they were doing, a girl who was great at motivating groups, and me, a guy who wasn't as good at the code but was the best at organizing stuff, so I was in charge of combining all the separate projects into one (this is important).

Now, every group has its deadbeats, and we were no exception. Meet cocky-lazy-ass, henceforth known as CLA. He had some talent in programming, but he was lazy as all-get-out. His part of the code took longer to get done than anyone else's, and when it finally got turned in, it was semi-broken, glitchy, used default names for everything, and relied on files he forgot to give me and then lost track of. It was not a project. Just a broken shell of a project named ""UntitledProject1"".

And to put cream on the cake, he spent the rest of his time reading news online while I finished the project. To put him into perspective, this was considered normal behavior for him too. I was pissed.

**The Revenge**

Every day, since I had AP Comp Sci first period, I would come in early to get some work done and turn on the computers, because the computer lab machines take forever to boot. 

Normally, I'm nice and I turn everyone's computer on, saving them time.

I stopped turning on CLA's computer in the morning. Wasted a good 2 &amp; 1/2 minutes of his time very day.

""Now click on it (keep in mind this is in a very thick accent)."" I told him I clicked on it and it didn't open. He tells me to click it again. After 3 or 4 times he asks me which part of the mouse I'm clicking, ""I'm clicking the right one."" He's clearly pissed and says I need to use the left one. We're probably into minute 10 here.

On day, I look down from my balcony and I see a white SUV parked in front of the dumpsters.  The SUV had a warning light, one of those ones you might see on a tow truck or municipal utility vehicle, mounted on a bracket on its driver's side front fender.  The wires from his light ran under his hood.  This SUV was an older Bronco.


Smoke started coming out of the hood of the SUV and within a few seconds small flames were visible.  I grabbed the fire extinguisher from my kitchen and ran down a flight of stairs.  When I got to the SUV smoke was still coming out but there were no more flames.  I yelled out for the owner of the truck but nobody appeared.  I considered dousing this guys truck with my fire extinguisher but I thought, ""F--- him.""

I went over to the far staircase of my building and went up to the second floor.  There I saw a fat guy, who was picking up his daughter from one of the neigbors leaving an apartment.

I asked in a very pissed off tone, ""Hey, is that your truck down there?""

He had a very dismissive look on his face and replied, ""Yeah, yeah.""

So I stopped him and asked what his problem was; what's the attitude for?  There was a good 20 to the 30 seconds of bickering between him and I, he thought I was just there to give him crap about his parking.  I still had the extinguisher in my hands.

Then I just stopped and said...""Hey...""(I smiled during this pause)""...Your truck's on fire."" 

He ran down the stairs.  By the time he got to his truck, the fire was gone and only a little smoke remained.  He popped his hood and there was a mess of burned wires.  He had to call a tow truck. 

TL;DR:  Fat guy parks where he shouldn't have, truck catches on fire.  When I find the guy to tell him about fire, he gives me attitude because he thinks I am confronting him about his parking.  I decide to take my time telling this guy his truck is on fire.","""Your truck's on fire""",200

In fact, every single parking spot--covered and uncovered--was taken.

I had to drive around the complex twice, in hopes that someone would leave during my rounds. No luck. I finally found a spot at the other end of the complex, right next to the dumpster. That meant that I got soaked running back to my building.

An hour later, I looked out my window to check on my spot. The truck was still there. I was fuming now. So I put on my raincoat and boots, grabbed my box cutter, and stomped over to that truck.

CGecko,28,52,1pycav,259,"Hey guys, I just discovered this sub and I’m having a blast reading all of your stories, so I thought I’d contribute one of my own. Now as a preface, it does involve frightening a child, so I’ll leave it up to you guys as to whether or not it was justified. It’s also a bit of a long read, so I apologize for that.

Background Info:

I worked at a summer camp for kids aged 7-17 starting when I was a sophomore
 in high school. The season lasted for eight weeks, and during that time a kid could stay anywhere from one to four weeks at a time. It was an awesome job and I had a great time and met a lot of awesome people (it’s also where I met the girl I’m now engaged to), but there were a few parts of the job that were bothersome. The primary issue was that dealing with viciously awful campers was something of an uphill battle as the higher-ups of the camp could rarely help you. The head counselor or director would usually have a “chat” with the camper but then send them right back to you to be more of a terror. The owner told us we were never allowed to call the kid’s parents to pick them up unless there was a medical emergency or they endangered a camper or staff member. So basically, some kids got a relatively free pass to be little monsters for up to a month at a time as there was nothing we could really do. 

The other important things to know are that the campers slept in the same cabins as the staff members (usually 12 campers and 3 staff), and that I was legendary across camp for my bedtime stories. I have a million of them, and they come in three primary types: humorous stories to make kids laugh, boring historical stories to make them fall asleep quickly, and ghost stories to give them a good fright. My policy is that I never tell ghost stories to any campers younger than 10, and only if the cabin agrees they all want to hear it. However, during my second summer at camp there was a camper who (temporarily) changed that policy.

The Nightmare:

This kid was around 9 years old and I’m going to call him Tyler. Tyler was staying for a one-week session, which meant that we was dropped off Sunday afternoon and would be picked up on Friday afternoon. On most weekends, the camp is closed and staff get the day off, but this week was coming off a stay-over weekend so most of us were already exhausted. As the new kids for the week arrive, most of us are keeping the kids from the weekend entertained while the others (including me) are awaiting the fresh campers for the coming week to check in. Tyler was checked in, accompanied by his mom and older brother, and brought his things down to my cabin to get settled. After making typical counselor small talk with his mom, I made my way over to his bunk to introduce myself. Our first interaction went something like this:

Me: Hey man! My name’s CGecko, what’s yours?

Tyler: Bite me!

He then spit at me and ran out of the cabin. I stood there kind of stunned and my co-counselor ran after him. His mom apologized profusely and I let it slide because I figured he was nervous about being away from home (first time camper, you see). Big mistake. 

Side note: Bite me turned into his catchphrase. I later learned that he learned it from his older brother who I also had as a camper and was also a pain (though not as severe).

The rest of the day is uneventful; we introduce ourselves to the new campers, play a few standard get-to-know-each-other games and have a good time. I’m starting to think more and more that Tyler’s behavior was the result of nerves. Until we get to the campfire.

Each week at camp begins with a campfire. The kids gather around and watch as the staff amuse them by leading songs and performing skits. We do the same ones every week and it can get a little stale, but my fellow staff were awesome so it was still a fun time. However, controlling the kids (especially younger ones) can be tough. Some might fidget a bit, ask to go to the bathroom seemingly dozens of times, or try to wander away from the campfire, but that’s typical kid behavior and we’re used to it. Tyler took things to another level. He complained (loudly) that every skit or song was boring and no amount of coaxing would convince him to stop. When he wasn’t doing that, he asked me to go to the bathroom (a little less than a quarter mile walk back up the hill to camp) no fewer than nine times. I don’t care how little you are, you don’t need to use the bathroom nine times in 90 minutes. 

Finally, the last straw came when Tyler picked up a decent-sized stick and threw it directly into the fire, causing a huge shower of sparks. Throwing anything at or into the fire is the number one no-no of campfire, and we tell the kids that at the beginning of the event. Plus, he could have easily hurt one of the staff with the stick or the sparks. At this point I received the covert head-nod from the director which means “bring that little toilet squirt to my office, now.”

I met up with the director in the head office with Tyler. The director explained carefully that what he did was dangerous, and that the owner of the camp was going to come talk with us. It was getting late now and I asked the director if I should return to my cabin and the other campers, he said no. So I stayed in the office for over an hour while Tyler poked and prodded me. Every time I looked over to ask him to stop, he just turned and gave me the biggest shit-eating grin you’ve ever seen. The owner finally arrived (she is a piece of work, but that’s another story), and basically told us that since it was only the first day, they didn’t want to send Tyler home because it was obviously just first-day jitters and he was “acting out.” No shit he was acting out. But it was obvious that they didn’t want to send him home because they would have to refund his mom’s money. 

I escorted Tyler back to the cabin, now furious. Not only was he being a little shit, but he had also made me miss the last part of campfire and putting the kids to bed. Bedtime on the first day is a crucial time and I always make sure to visit each child and talk about their day. Now I wouldn’t get to do that or tell a good story. Not only that, but after I put the little booger to bed he kept me up until midnight asking for multiple cups of water. 

The next day i was in a bad mood but still put on my best happy face to start leading activities (being a camp counselor, you learn to deal with being tired as a way of life). Each day the children go to five activity periods of their choosing, with lunch in between. Each staff member teaches four one-hour activity blocks and gets 1 hour off. My activities that week were clay sculpting, archery, canoeing, and improv games. I was excited because improv and archery are my favorite activities. But, lo and behold, who is in both of those blocks? Fucking Tyler. 

Over the next three days, he continuously caused disruptions in both classes (and his other three activities, from what I heard). He whined constantly when he was told it was another camper’s turn to lead improv games, constantly stepped over other’s lines and made rude and terrible jokes which ruined the scene. On Tuesday he picked on a girl so relentlessly that she cried. During archery, he often pretended he didn’t hear my instructions and fired his arrows off turn (when kids are that young, we have to tell them exactly when to let the arrow go). There’s no way I can prove it, but I’m also sure he fired at least three arrows into the woods on purpose. 

Over the course of the week I took him to the director’s office three more times for unruly behavior during an activity or meal period. All three times, the director gave him a “stern talking to” which of course did nothing. I could have done that. I was getting more and more frustrated as Tyler was ruining an otherwise awesome week, as the other eleven campers in my cabin were all model kids who were fun to teach. 

Finally, I snapped when Tyler actually endangered another kid’s life at the archery range. As I said, we have to give kids instructions on when to do everything, which includes retrieving arrows. Obviously, firing at the target while a kid is down range retrieving arrows is very dangerous and completely illegal. So, naturally, on Wednesday of that week while I’m telling the kids to go down range and retrieve arrows, Tyler fires a fucking arrow down range. 

I immediately lose it. Tyler is not the best shot and he could have easily injured the kid at the target next to him. I snatch the bow away and tell him to wait in the shack (the small storage shed/office next to the range) and to not move. He fucking smiles at me as he heads over there. I am absolutely furious so I leave the other campers with my co-instructor and take a deep breath and drink of water before entering the shack. I’m not even calling the director, I’m calling the owner and getting this fucker thrown out.  

I call the owner’s direct line and after talking for ten minutes she tells me to bring Tyler to the office. She then tells me that because of the nature of the incident, they are going to take away Tyler’s snack for the rest of the week. When I remind her that he could have killed a kid, she tells me that she wants to not “pursue it” because it’s “my word against his” and that the other kid’s parents could sue. As she talks I am continuously trying not to smack her. I think she could see my face getting red because she tells me to bring Tyler back to the cabin and to take the rest of the hour off. 

At this point, I am fuming. During my hour off I vent to my co-counselor and nearly start crying. After I’ve calmed down I go to dinner and tell myself that I did everything I could do. As soon as I sit down though, Tyler sits at my table. I ignore him, but he tells me that he had an awesome time at archery earlier and can’t wait to do it again. 

Now it’s on.

The Revenge:

At this point, I start thinking of anything I can do to make this kid feel some consequences for his actions. I can bring him to the director until my shoes wear out but he doesn’t care. So I need to do something more subtle. After thinking about it, I realize that the perfect weapon in my little revenge act will be my ghost stories.

Now as I mentioned before, I never tell ghost stories to kids younger than 10 because they get scared really easily. Older kids love my stories because they feel a little creeped out, but overall enjoy the story and just go to bed after. With little kids, it can be a disaster. If they don’t stay up all night freaked out, then they become catatonic at breakfast the next day and act really jumpy. That’s why I never tell scary stories to small children, except when they deserve it (i.e., Tyler). 

So over the next few days, I start doing a little research. I want to find out what Tyler is scared of, and get into his head. It has to be perfect: something that will scare the absolute shit out of Tyler but not mess up my other kids (who, as mentioned, are model campers). So after observing him the rest of the day and the next day, I think I might have something. 

During my hour off, I know that Tyler has an activity in the arts-and-crafts building. So, I take my hour off making friendship bracelets with some other kids near the building (which, if you’ve never received a friendship bracelet from a kid, is just about the most adorable activity ever). Plus, I’m earning some bonus points with my director for using my hour off to watch kids, so it’s a win-win. So I’m keeping one eye on my group of kids and one eye on Tyler at the craft table. The pivotal moment happens twenty minutes into the period: Tyler freaks the fuck out when a spider crawls across his paper. He screams like a baby and yells at the counselor in charge to kill it for him. The counselor flicks the spider off onto the ground and Tyler is wary of that spot for the rest of the period. So, bingo: he’s afraid of spiders.

I knew that night would be my last chance, as Tyler would be leaving the next afternoon. So I spend the rest of the day crafting an absolutely beautiful scary story about a giant spider catching a kid in his web. During dinner I half paid attention to kids and half thought of the details for the story I’d tell that night. It was not my best counseling, but the payoff made it worth it in the end. 

Finally, that night, I asked the cabin if they’d like to hear a spooky story. Everyone said yes enthusiastically, especially Tyler. So I let him have it, telling a ridiculous twenty minute story about a child (who looked suspiciously like Tyler) getting caught in the web of a giant spider. I embellished the shit out of this story, making creepy spider noises and using my best overly-dramatic voice. The best part is that every other camper thought it was hysterical, while Tyler looked like he was going to shit his Pampers. My co-counselor, who figured out exactly what I was doing, was roaring with laughter the entire time. 

That night, Tyler stayed up for a long time. He continuously asked my co-counselor to come over and talk to him. I waited eagerly each time for him to return to the counselor room to tell me what he was saying. He told me that Tyler asked him multiple times if “The Giant Spider of [Redacted] County” was actually real. We stifled laughter and eventually everyone drifted off to sleep peacefully.

The next day was move-out day and Tyler was absolutely miserable. He didn’t say anything at breakfast or lunch (which is always pizza on move-out day). I asked him what was wrong and he kept telling me “nothing.” Ironically, this was the day he was best-behaved out of the whole week. 

Finally, his mom and dad arrived to pick him up along with his brother. Everyone on staff was looking forward to this and I saw more than a few other counselors watching the action from the porches of their cabins. Tyler’s mom comes up to the porch, says hi and we exchange pleasantries. Tyler comes out of the cabin with his stuff and his dad asks how his week at camp was. 

Tyler immediately starts crying hysterically. His mom hugs him, cooing softly and telling him it’s ok, he can come back next year. Tyler doesn’t say anything, just keeps crying. After ten minutes or so of this, his dad gets fed up, apologizes to me, and grabs Tyler’s shit. He then tells him they’re going to the car. 

I watch and wave politely as they leave, and can’t help but put on a giant shit-eating grin as Tyler looks back at the cabin. The best part for me, though, was something I actually heard from another staff member: apparently when Tyler was being dragged to the car crying, his dad told him he would never come to camp again if he kept acting up like he was. 

I don’t know how much justice it served, but I certainly felt vindicated. Tyler never did come back to camp, although his brother did, and I would happily trade Tyler for his brother any day. Sometimes when his brother came to camp later I would see Tyler, and he would always look away from me immediately. 

His parents were great, though. No idea how such hellspawn come from nice parents.

TL;DR: Kid nearly gets away with everything at summer camp, I probably pay the bills of his therapist for a while. ","Horrible camper nearly injures someone, I get some spooky revenge.",311

While my team were still not competing my friend (in the other team) decided to make funny noises in the game.

I told everyone in my class not to laugh at my PE teacher's jokes no matter how funny it is in the next PE lesson. They all agreed to do that.

Due to me being 300 miles from home with nothing to do, I would come in at 10ish AM, and would leave around 2ish AM. I didn't have anything else to do, so why not. I worked the 4 days doing pretty much the same schedule. 

Fast forward a month later. An employee, lets call him D, comes to my store while on vacation and starts chatting up my boss (my boss and I are really close). He is kissing his ass because he wants to transfer over to my store. While talking to my boss, I come up in conversation and D say's he isnt surprised I'm not working right now. He figured I was still sleeping. My boss asks why and D replied that I didnt come into noon while working at his store. My boss quickly set him straight and told him its not wise to talk shit about other employees that have 10 years seniority when you just started, is higher up than you, etc. I was actually doing a deposit on my day off.

**Revenge** To say the least, I was a little pissed he was talking shit about me and my work ethic, something I pride myself on. I often wake up randomly during the night and check the work email. I started forwarding and responding to emails to him at all hours of the night. He likes to brag about how he always has his phone with him and finally asked me to stop sending him emails from 12AM to 8AM. Step one complete. I then started calling him during the middle of the night telling him that his store alarm went off and he needed to check in with the police at the store. He would show up, and nobody would be there. He would submit OT requests for being called out and my boss would deny it due to there being no police report. Step two complete. Lastly,  he put in a transfer to my store last week. My boss stood up in a meeting with the other ""big bosses"" and told them that he didn't want him to work at my store because he was a liar and a shitty employee.  ",Complain that I'm lazy to my boss; get emails and called out at all hours.,92
stowawaythrow,5,5,1pwnpd,56,"I moved a few months ago and the neighbors (a couple) who live above me are horrible. They fight EVERY DAY for at least an hour, which is mostly the woman screaming at her boyfriend while taking a hissy fit (throwing pots, stomping, slamming cupboards/doors. And just screaming ""AAAHHHHUUURG"" repeatedly at the top of her lungs.) 

They do not feel the need to keep this to reasonable hours as I have been woken up almost every day since I have moved here from them either stomping, slamming their door/cupboards, JUMPING down the stairs or playing the radio very loudly. I complained to the landlord three times in the first month (first time was for them slamming their door so hard that it made the room shake every day at 6AM, which they would do repeatedly every day. Second and third time were for two days in a row that I was woken up due to them having hour long arguments which mostly consisted of the woman screaming nonsense. The stomping is so loud that if I wear noise cancelling headphones, I can't hear half of it.. But I can feel the other half.)

At this point I don't spend a lot of time at home. I work during the day, so the only time I have to do laundry is in the evenings (I am not at home at all on the weekends.) and usually that's only a couple nights a week. Last week I was determined to do my laundry, as I had no clean pants left (I'm a chick so that means all I had were skirts and leggings.) On Monday, I checked the laundry room. There is two washers and one dryer for 16 apartments (that all have 1-2 people living in them) and the dryer and one washer were both full with clean clothes. A purple laundry basket and tide soap were left there that belonged to the owner of the clothes. I said eh, I can do it tomorrow, and I left the house for the evening.

The next day rolls around. I go to do my laundry after work. Both washers and the dryer are full of clean clothes again. I think alright, well, the washers take 35 minutes and the dryer takes 50. So I'll come back in about two hours. In the space of that two hours, my neighbors spend one arguing. After they're finished arguing, it's the two hour mark. I had heard their door slam a few minutes before, and on my way to check, I ran into the man who lives above me. I said nothing. When I got to the laundry room, the wet clothes had just been put in the dryer, and another load in the washer. One of the laundry baskets was the purple one, and it was the same soap. So that tells me the laundry from the previous day and that day were of the people above me.

I only had another two hours of free time and their laundry was not done before that. I ended up not being free to do it.. Until tonight. Which is where my revenge comes in.

As soon as I got home from work, I checked the laundry room. Everything was empty, so I loaded up a washer. About 2 minutes after I got back into my apartment, I heard the people above me slam the door and then come back 5 minutes later.

I put a timer on my phone for 30 minutes so that I'd be downstairs in time for when the washer was almost done. When I got there, sure enough, the upstairs neighbors also decided to do a load of laundry. Theirs was actually done before mine, but I got downstairs before them. Mine finished 5 minutes later and I loaded it into the one dryer, loaded another load into the washer, and headed back to my apartment. I ran into the guy who lives upstairs. He was headed for the laundry room... Which means he found the dryer in use, which means he has to wait an hour. (Longer if I get to the dryer before it's finished and put my other load in. I'm planning to do this twice more.) 

The best part is that he looked at me, saw my laundry basket, and knew it was me who beat him there. That and it's really not something that he can complain about (they did 4 loads last week and left them there for two hours before moving them. At least I'm being efficient!)

This is a cross-post from /r/fatpeoplestories. Several people suggested I should cross-post here. The short version is that a well-dressed morbidly obese woman chooses to sit next to (basically on top of) my friend and I in a movie theater because she is too lazy to walk to one of the numerous completely empty rows. Her incredibly low-density fat spills under and around the armrest, basically engulfing my friend, yet she still chooses not to move.

My friend, who has a reputation for confronting assholes in public, comes up with a plan that uses the woman's own fatness and rudeness to get revenge.

tryingtoworkoutmylif,157,280,1pwglb,1080,"So about a year ago they subdivided one of my neighbors property's, and problems ensued.

So where I live there were three (now four) houses sharing the same driveway, with a fence on both sides so there is nowhere else to go. Now the guy who was building the house came over to my place on day one and explained that here's my number to call, and I will be here the whole time except for my two week vacation in a month.

Well, to build a house it requires a lot of truckloads of cement and various things. Generally the days that they did this they would go to all of the neighbors houses early in the morning to give them some time  to move their car out onto the street so they weren't blocked in. 

A month later, while the guy who I have the contact details for is on vacation, I drive down the driveway, turn the corner (it's an L shape) and find a fracking massive gravel truck there, just pulled up. Now, there's space for the truck to move off the driveway, but he looked new and probably didn't understand the situation. So I get out of my car as he gets out of his cab, walk up to him and politely ask him if he can move the truck off the driveway so we can get access. He just looks at me and goes ""Fuck off kid, real men doing work here. I ain't movin."" I say it again being serious this time and say that I have somewhere to be and that they aren't following the access policy (which all the houses signed). I get told to fuck off yet again, and then the guy starts to try to threaten me. So, I walk away and think, how will I get to meet up with my friends?... (for movie marathon, awesome btw.)

So a few texts later, my friends pull into my driveway as instructed by me, and park directly behind his truck, blocking him in. He had no way out. My friends jump out, lock their cars, and walk towards my place. 

Guy comes out shouting ""You can't park there this is an active construction site! This is illegal, I will call the cops"". I walk up to him, say that since this is now a parking lot according to you, I will park here as I have the right to use it. And to top it off I inform him that what he is doing is illegal, and I'm not as I own the land that we're standing on.

One and a half hours later, when we need to go get more supplies, we find him in his cab fuming to the site manager on holiday and being told that he's in the wrong. 

We go somewhere in our cars, come back and of course he's gone.
When the site manager gets back he comes with the truck driver and they both apologize to me. Even gave me a half dozen beers as a apology gift. Best. Feeling. Ever.

Should i post the story here too? you can just follow the link.


EDIT: heres the story.


At a local chain grocery, let's call it Slop n Slave, I have just spent the better part of an hour doing my weekly shopping as I normally do. There's easily $150 worth in the cart. I unload it all and as I have always done put the beer on last so I can be ready with my ID when the cashier needs it. So she's rung up all my items and finally gets to the beer and asks for the ID. I produce my US issued, completely valid and well traveled passport that clearly states my date of birth (in three languages even!).

""I can't take that."" Flatly with a hint of disdain.

""What do you mean?"" I say.

She repeats herself and for a moment I stare and think.

""So you're telling me you won't take the Federal Government's say so that I am old enough?""

""We don't take passports. I need to see your &lt;state&gt; driver's license.""

""I don't drive so I don't have one. This is my ID. It's a perfectly valid US government issued ID. Even foreign governments respect this document."" I'm not mad at this point just confused.

""Sorry I can't take that.""

""Okay... then I'd like to talk to your supervisor.""

She waives over some guy with a tie and a badge that says manager.

""What seems to be the trouble here?"" Says Mr. Manager.

I pipe up and explain that his cashier refuses to accept my US issued passport as proof of age. He takes it. Looks at it for a long moment. Hands it back to me. ""We don't take passports.""

Now I'm starting to get pissed. ""I'm sorry sir but this is a valid US passport and it must be accepted as proof of age.""

""I don't have to accept anything. How do I know that's not fake anyway?""

""Wait, what! But you just looked at it... never mind... why won't you take this as proof?""

""Because it's not a &lt;state&gt; driver's license.""

""That'[s]* just ridiculous. I don't drive so I don't have a driver's license. I've never had trouble in the past using this here or anywhere for that matter. What are people from out of state supposed to do? What about foreign nationals with their respective passports? What about military IDs, do you take those?""

""Look, we don't take passports and I don't have time to discuss this with you anymore.""

Yep, now I'm pissed.

""Fine then, guess what? You can re-shelve all this s[--]*t and I'll never come back to this place again. I'll also be sure to tell all my friends, family and anybody that will listen on the internet that you people are ignorant jerks. Also, I'll be phoning our local law enforcement agency to ask their advice. Have fun putting all your crap back.""

I walk out of the store vocally asserting that the staff of the store are jerks and once outside do as I said and phoned up the &lt;city&gt;PD.

Guess what? By law they [are]* required to honor all the forms of ID I mentioned (and state IDs from all 50 states and Canadian provinces too no less!) The PD officer I spoke with even offered to send a cruiser around to straighten them out. Well I declined the offer since I was already out of the store and just needed to go get my freaking groceries, again.

So I went to shall we say, Shucks, and have never had a problem with their nice and friendly staff or using my passport. Thanks Shucks for being normal, reasonable people.

I'm not sure how it is in other universities, but at mine if your class is from 12:00 - 1:30 for example, the actual lecture is 12:00 - 1:20 with the 10 minutes being travel time. Usually my math professor will let us go at 1:15 instead of starting a new concept and getting cut off by the bell. 

**The Crime**

At around 1:10, some people start shuffling around, packing up their bags, talking to their friends, etc. and generally being very disrespectful. Naturally, the professor gets agitated at this. 

**The Revenge**

Instead of letting us go 5 minutes early, he keeps us to the very end of class. Some people who have class on the other side of campus now have to rush there, there's less time to relax between classes, and now we've gotten cut off on the new topic that was *supposed* to start the next class. Just not a very pleasant experience for anyone.

I'm not happy about it, but I would do the same in his place. The sad part is, this has happened for the past 3 or 4 classes and people just do not learn that if you stay quiet, the prof will end class a little early.

deputydavis,6,46,1pvpby,182,"A few months back I was in New Orleans for a competition.  In the semi-finals of the tournament (the details of which aren't important), my team absolutely dominated this team from the Los Angeles area.  There was no doubt in any of the spectators' minds that we won that round.  Unfortunately, the competition is judged very subjectively and it turns out we lost of the round (it was an academic-y tournament with judges who give scores based on whatever criteria is important to them).  It wasn't a big deal, it happens, I understand the rules, I knew it was subjective.  It wasn't the first time I thought my team had won but we did not.

That evening, at a ""banquet"" celebrating the end of the tournament, the hosts had rented an all you can drink upstairs thing on bourbon street, we had a balcony, everyone had beads and we were throwing them.  It was a ton of fun.

But then the coach of the other team that beat us, comes up to us and starts bragging about his team's victory in a way that only someone from LA could.  It was rude, it was bad sportsmanship, and it really ticked me off.  I remember him saying something particularly offensive about one of the girls on our team.  But I cooled off, took a moment, and my teammates and i plotted our revenge.  

I went into the bar and ordered 4 cranberry vodkas. As I walked behind the man who was leaning over the railing throwing beads down to people below, my team mate ""happened"" to walk past us, bump into me, and all four drinks spilled down the back of that arrogant SOB.

He was so shocked he dropped his drink and turned around furious.  I apologized profusely.  I offered to get him a new one and apologized again for the half gallon of cranberry juice that was soaking into the back of his white button down shirt.

I brought him his drink, played off the thing as an accident, he made a bunch of jokes about how clumsy i was.  He used it as more fuel to make fun of me.  But everyone there that I cared about knew what was up. Totally worth it.

theirishembassy,67,292,1pv4qo,1092,"So, I recently discovered this subreddit and I used to work in a call centre for 4 years (we serviced every major bank in Canada and 100+ credit unions).  I'm thinking about doing up a few of these, but i'll start off with one of my favourites. It's a bit of a long read, but it pays off.


A few years ago we did a two week pilot project for TD Canada Trust called ""the iPod campaign"". You switch 2 monthly payments (a mortgage payment, insurance, gym membership, etc) over to be debited from a newly opened TD account and the bank will give you a free iPod shuffle. For the campaign, I was part of a team of a dozen agents that dealt with these switches, and the only one on staff to handle complaints. We couldn't process any of these switches without an ""authorization form"" that the client signed when they opened their account. This stated they gave us permission to switch debits over on their behalf. Last day of the campaign, I get a few auth forms on my desk, they're blank, no customer signatures, no customer contact numbers, just the account numbers, and the teller/clients names. I call the branch rep twice (our policy), over two days with my last call stating ""unfortunately if we don't receive the forms with the customer signatures by 8PM local time, we will be unable to process the request and the documents will be destroyed for security purposes"". 


Fast forward a week; the branch rep calls me back. ""Hi my name is Jon with TD Canada Trust EasySwitch, how may I assist you today?"" ""Hello, is this the scam artist that can explain when my none of my client's are getting their iPods?"". Bad opening, but I've had worse. I begin to explain that this particular form she was calling about was blank, the campaign was done, no iPod for the client. ""Did you hear that?"" she says. ""We certainly did and frankly that's a crock of shit"", responded the clients. She had two of them in a conference call. Wrong move bitch, wrong move. 



&gt;*ME*: ""Mr. and Ms. _______, my apologies for any inconvenience. As I'd explained to your branch rep in a voicemail last last week, she had sent us a blank authorization form. Without your signature's we didn't have the legal authority to contact any of your billers to process the switch.

[deleted],4,42,1pv1fw,163,"I was in my first year of Uni, in a ground floor apartment with 4 other people. One on my flat mates had got lucky with a huge disabled room,(even though he wasn't disabled) accompanied by a huge fire door. This thing made some noise when it closed! I was in the room next door  got the full brunt of it. He must have opened and closed that door 30+ times a day. He woke me up in the morning, he woke me up in the afternoon and he generally annoyed the shit out of me. I mentioned it several times and how to be more aware of the noise it makes. Yet he carried on. 
  I hatched a plan to remove said door and padlock it to the radiator. Until he repented his sins and his door privileges would be returned. So off I go to the hardware store to get the necessaries. 
  So here I am removing the door, when I realise this may be a step to far. I decide to explore the petty options. The one a chose was to rehang the door in such away that it got stuck half way. It required some fudging to close but did so in a quiet way. He brought up the door a couple of weeks after this, about how it was annoying him getting stuck.

My friend came in to rehearse before church at 9:00 AM, looking like death warmed over.

I commiserated but then she smiled and said she'd probably made sure they wouldn't do it again.  She had an old-school record player that would automatically go back to the beginning of that side of the LP, and she set it up with side 1 of the opera Carmina Burana* at full volume when she and the kids left the apartment at 8:30 in the morning.

When I was in high school there was this girl, Katie, who had an on &amp; off best friendship with me.

She &amp; her wannabe ghetto friend started to be very mean to my friends and I on a daily basis. I ignored this for about half the school year, slowly plotting my revenge.

After a couple of months I slowly started to notice that these two kept passing a notebook back and forth between classes. I realized that this was obviously their ""secret"" note book. So, I watched them all day keeping track of that notebook until my computer class came along (it was easy to get out of that class). I snuck out of my class, found the locker it was in, and stole it. When classes changed I sneakily watched Katie as she opened her locker and started to freak out. I laughed to myself. She immediately was texting me accusing me of stealing it and I said ""I don't know what you're talking about. Why would I steal a notebook?"". For some reason, she believed me.

I didn't read it until about a week later when I let my other friends in on it and they insisted we read it. Not only did I get petty revenge but, I also got to laugh at all the nasty whorish stuff they had written. I still have it &amp; they still have no clue who took it.

Funkaholic,8,23,1ps1qu,58,"Background:
I'm a guy.
Everybody involved is in college.

The story:

I'm talking to one of my friends who works as a barista in a little coffee shop inside a fairly large bookstore.  We'll call her B.  When B isn't making drinks for people, we just stand to the side away from the cash register.  We're talking about B's new boyfriend and my persistent girl problems when enter Tool.  B goes to make Tool his drink and returns to resume our conversation.  However, Tool soon returns and interrupts our conversation.  Ignoring my presence, he pushes a penny into her face and starts touting off about it being 19XX mint worth $1000 dollars and blah blah blah.  The inflection in his voice makes it painfully apparent he is trying to impress B.  After he finishes his shpeal, he looks at me and says ""Sup?"".  The kind of sup accompanied by a little upwards nod that doesn't mean ""What's up?"" but actually means ""What are you gonna do about it?""  This is frustrating for me because, for all Tool knew, B and I were dating which I found very rude.  B says something the lines of ""Cool story, bro."".  Tool walks off but returns shorty, interrupting again with ""Are you trying to hurt me?  I get the feeling you don't like me from how hot this coffee is!""  B is fuming.  She takes his coffee, and with hands shaking, puts one of those cardboard heat protectors around it before handing it back.  Tool walks off again.

The petty revenge:

Enter C

C, another barista and also good friend walks in and greets us.  We tell her about Tool and she laughs.  I figure C is coming in to replace B at the counter but this isn't the case as B's replacement soon walks in.  C, as it turns out, is meeting a classmate to ""talk about schoolwork.""  C texts her classmate and tells him she is at the coffee shop.  (I bet you guys have no idea where this is going.)  Who comes walking up?  None other than Tool.  C asks if Tool is actually Tool to which I replay ""Hooooooo yeah.""  C then berates Tool for being a creeper to B.  This isn't the petty revenge.  The revenge is after Tool gives his improv school conversation, he asks C if she wants to go to a house party with him.  Tool isn't 21 yet and can't go to the bars.  C, although a little frustrated she was dragged out of her PJs for this, politely says she would rather not go to a house party with people she doesn't really know, but Tool persists. I've had enough of Tool for one evening and feel it's my turn to interrupt.  I turn to C and ask her if she wants to go to the bars with me.  I hadn't planned on going to the bars, but I hadn't seen C in awhile and legitimately wanted to catch up with her, just about as much as I legitimately wanted to put Tool in his place.  She agrees and B, C, and I leave Tool in the coffee shop as we go to the bars and have a wonderful time, fully embracing our platonic relationships.

She would watch like a hawk when I got home from work (work nights at the PD in a neighboring city). One day I was able to get off work an hour early and told the guy that was blocked in to call me directly each time she did it. 

Well, he just happens to call on this day, so I get the tow truck enroute before I am even there.  I get there with just enough time to cover her entire front windshield with those bright orange stickers you see police put on abandoned vehicles on the side of the road.

Adriatic_Whaler,10,17,1prah8,61,"I've been in this apartment for two and a half years now and I have the most interesting neighbors next door. As far as I could see through their door, their apartment is clean and tidy, but they use our really small hallway as their storage for excess furniture and trash that is to be thrown out. My landlord told me they were like this all the time. I don't know how it goes in other countries, but in mine it's ok to put your trash on the hallway for, say, a night, and then throw it in the container. But these people were...overdoing it, at the least.


On the right side of their door is some old, raggedy cupboard and on the left, two or three boxes with tiles and similar stuff, stacked on one another, which I never fail to bash with a traveling bag in silent protest when I'm going to and returning from a trip. And although it's only a family of three, they use probably the biggest trash bags they can find. So - if there is only three of them, and one of them being a(n obnoxious) child, they need days to fill that man-sized bag, which means the trash is already rotting inside. Add to the equation that we're on the top floor and you get a nice, full bouquet of rot and mold every summer.


The thing that did it was when they bought a new washing machine and, although they had two workers to bring it up the stairs (we don't have an elevator) and install it, they asked the workers to put the old one at the bottom of the stairs, instead of letting them take/buy the old one for spare parts, recyclables etc. That washing machine ended down there for more than two months, so now I had to dodge their furniture, enjoy the smell of decay if their trash was out and then almost squeeze past the washing machine in between the floors. I used a subtle tactic of annoying them with opening the door on the machine every time I had to pass it by, but to no avail. They were closing it for some time, then let it stay open. Last week, they changed their double bed mattress and put the old one on the stairs and leaned it on the wall. Thankfully, it was there only for a few days.


So, last weekend, I head out with my friend to do grocery shopping for the next month. As I'm a powerlifter and he is training to become one, too, a lot of food has been bought and brought to my apartment, including 14 kg / ~30 pounds of meat. When I finished trimming the fat and intestines off the meat, that left me with about 1 kg / 2 pounds of it. I put that in the trash bag and put the bag in the hallway. It was Saturday night and I intended to throw it out in the morning.


However, when I got out the next morning, I felt pungent stench of meat, fat and intestines that had started to rot. With a grin from ear to ear, I came back inside and closed the door. Tightly. As most people do, my neighbors do a lot of cooking on the Sundays and, since they don't have any opposing windows, they have to open the door to vent it. By the lunch time, the stench was unbearable. So now they had to choose between having the apartment full of moisture and cooking odors, turning their AC on in the end of October or nourish themselves with the stench of hell's asshole on the day when whole family is finally together.


I left it there almost till midnight. Even the next morning it could be smelled faintly. Although I don't think they will learn anything from it, I was delighted all day while thinking about the gas chamber I created both outside and inside their apartment, since they couldn't properly air the apartment and all that on Sunday, when they rest and enjoy together and usually annoy me with psychedelic rock music and Nazgûl shrieks of their ""playful"" (read: retarded) son.

I could go faster, but I stay around that for quick stops because there's a decent population of stray dogs who hang around back here. Back near my neighborhood I see a few deer in the fall. That said, don't want to hit anyone/anything. 

He keeps a respectful distance at first, but that quickly dissipates. He's on my ass after about 15 seconds. Being a fan a messing with people, and also being an ultiophile, I came off my gas and coasted, letting sweet inertia and friction decide my speed. He starts veering behind me, trying to intimidate me or make me go faster. Fat chance jerkoff. After we cross the railroad tracks, he swerves from behind and makes eye contact. I put up my middle finger and mouth 'your mom!'.

He speeds off, the bastard. I saw him enter Walmart's lot and saw him in the store and chuckled at him. He looked like a bowling ball with dreadlocks. *Pause* Say it to yourself again, and use your imagination. I'll wait. 

**Part the Second**

All the reasons people despise Walmart and then some. Hambeasts wearing leggings and belly shirts, the noise, and my general disdain for people made my pace twice the usual. I get the sausages and head to checkout. I ask the girl(probably my age, 18-20) if she's open (she looked she was doing something with her till is why I asked). She nods. 

No words? That grinds my gears. I believe in speaking to whoever. If I make eye contact I'll either speak or smile or nod, depeding on who it is and distance. We'll call her Rudey, pun intended

Me: ""How's it going""

Rudey: *nods*

More silence. Me thinking this chick must be mute; she sure isn't foreign. 

Her: Your total is 12 whatever (I don't remember)

Me in my head: *oh you do talk bitch! Surprise sur-frickin-prise!*

I swipe to pay, she hands me my receipt. I say have a good day of some variant upwards of 92%, but not for her. I made eye contact, and walked away, palming my nuts. 

**Part the Third**

I leave the lot, and start back. Halfway between Wally World and the railroad tracks, some woman starts getting to close. I come off my gas; she retreats, cool.

But wait! There's more! This wench starts riding my bumper with a new vigor. I was orginally doing about 40, because, as previously that's the speed limit. More importantly, a good number of animals cross through here, mainly dogs, and I don't want to hit any, for obvious reasons. She stays on my ass; I suppose we both knew she wouldn't have the juice to beat me without hitting the railroad post by this point.

So I got down to about 35. Still riding, still cursing at me, so I go slower. We reach the stop sign. I make sure to check not once, but three times, and wave an old lady through. I pass through. By this point I figure I'll try to be nice to the people behind her, as I don't want to be a jerk.

The wench continues her vehicular air humping! So I get down to 30, and coast all the way to the intersection to go home. She veered around me a sped off. 

I feel better now. :)

TL;DR

1. Jackass tailgates, gets time wasted and is a living bowling ball with dreadlocks. 

2. Rudey doesn't talk until I have to pay, I don't wish her a good day. 

3. Wench rides my bumper, gets more time wasted and doesn't have the horses to get around.

ThisIsARealAcc,4,17,1pqvhz,45,"Background:

This was a number of years ago, back when I was 16. In English, we were studying Romeo and Juliet, which obviously required a book that had all the lines from the play in it. The book had my name in it, and my form level, easily returnable, or you can just take it to Lost and Found. 

The issue of the book:

What happened is a little confusing, I'll list the people involved as numbers for it. I let 1 borrow my book, expecting it to be returned by the end of the day. It didn't happen. I asked 1 where my book was, he said he gave it to 2. I asked 2 if he had my book, and he said he left it on the table not knowing it was mine. Now this is becoming a lost cause already. That is until 3 said he saw it on top of a locker. I asked 3 when he saw it and he said yesterday. I ask around a bit, then 4 says he took it from the top of the locker and gave it to 5, but 5 doesn't like me that much so he gave it back to 4, 4 gave it back to 5, who then left it on top of the locker once more. Fast forward to a week later, maybe two weeks. Turns out 6 has my book, and that 5 got in trouble trying to get it off him. 

Hearing this, 1 (who I bothered a lot to pay me for the loss of my book OR find my book) finds 7, who took it from 6 to give to 1 to give to me, then gives me my book. I open it up, and it has my name scribbled out, with his name written underneath it in his terrible handwriting. 

Now, when it comes to revenge, I can get pretty petty to a terrible human being. I hit in between for this one. That book was mine, and he ruined it. 

So, I went to the in between revenge, an awful inconvenience, but nothing day-ruining. I decide to spend the night with his school email. I sign him up for over 100 weekly newsletters. 

I never really saw much of a response from 6, but I hope he had fun unsubscribing from women's make up tips and garden lovers weekly eNewsletters. ","So you think you can steal MY book and claim it as yours, huh?",62

I went early because if I don't I end up going during afternoon school traffic, which sucks.

As I was leaving a double diesel  tank pickup started following me. When I got to my car it left enough room for me to back out. And waited.

Now, there's something else I haven't mentioned. My spot was pretty good. Right next to the handicapped ones. Which means the giant pickup's ass was hanging out blocking traffic in all sorts of directions.

Nothing official and no roads are closed, but for a half mile stretch of road people would walk down the block and back in their costumes.  Many people show up and find a spot to sit and people watch.  Theres park benches, stone walls (they were planters and were nice to sit on) or people bring their own chairs.  I showed up about an hour after dark and it was starting to get crowded.

About a third of the way in, some people sitting in a stone planter leave, so I sit down.  Not an ideal spot, but places to sit are rare.  I'm enjoying people watching when a group wearing Avenger costumes starting getting attention.  A crowd started to form around them, causing the flow of people to stop.  They were funneling right against me, so to keep my knees from continually getting hit, I stood up on the planter.  A few people next to me did the same.  As people were squeezing by they were thanking us for giving them a little more room to move.

Anodesu,3,4,1pq19r,22,"Now I did not personally enact this revenge, but I must say, I was beyond impressed with how clever it was.

Halloween this year had been really irritating. I live in a subdivision near a university, meaning I live in a neighbourhood with a mix of young families and students. I LOVE giving out candy to the kids, and dress myself up to give them candy. They're utterly adorable. We got full sized chocolate bars for them to take home, and they were all so happy.

But of course, you always get the smart-ass teens and young adults that come and try to get some free candy out of us. I give them small candy bars in retaliation, mostly because I fear eggings. It pisses me off to no end that older kids do this and I have ranted about it time and time again.

So I came in to my college animation class today and there is one particularly loud guy in my class that has always been fairly immature. Today the subject of halloween came up with my group of friends and he chimes in to the conversation, fishing for something in his pocket.

""Do you want to know what someone gave me for halloween?"" He said to me, finally holding it in my face. It was something small and grey, and I quickly realized what it was. It was a computer key.

""An F3 key!"" He shouts at me (again, he had a touch for the dramatics). 

I give him a blank look. ""Why did you get it? Because you were trick or treating while still in college?"" 

He grumbles something in response and walks off, realizing he won't get any sympathy from me. In the end, I got a huge laugh out of it and am now considering trying that trick myself next year. maybe I'll wrap them to disguise them as candy too.

suddenlysomnolent,8,9,1ppy84,0,"Growing up, my family was rife with incidents of petty revenge.  It still goes on, even though we're all adults.  We've somehow dragged our spouses into it, who initially acted horrified over how low we were willing to go just to get even.  There are six of us, not counting the spouses, and in order of age it was dad, mom, me, my brother, my sister and my youngest brother.  Here are three stories that stand out:

1st story: My sister was by far the worst of all of us.  She always had the most evil plots and would wait to exact her revenge for weeks until you'd forgotten how you wronged her.  One year, my brother somehow pissed her off.  So she waited until Christmas and when he got a new series of books that he was really wanting, she tore out the last chapter out of each.  As an avid book lover, this horrifies me to no end, even now.

2nd story: I had just gotten married and my husband and I were staying with my family (I'm the oldest) for a couple of weeks before we moved back to Germany.  McDonald's was doing a 50-piece chicken mcnugget promo for the Super Bowl, so he bought himself one.  He offered to pick up something for everyone else, but nobody wanted anything.  After he returned and was starting to watch the game, my youngest brother wanted him to make another trip to McDonald's because he changed his mind.  My husband said no and went back to watching the game.  He made it through half the bucket before he felt sick and put it in the refrigerator to eat later.  When he returned to it the next morning, there was only two left and one of them had a bite taken out of it.  Nobody would fess up, and he was shocked that a family he'd only known for less than a week would do something like this.

3rd story:  On another visit to my family's house, my mom offered to pick everyone up something from the store during her bi-weekly grocery shopping trip.  My husband asked for some HotPockets, and she got him one of the 12-packs to last him till the next trip.  Having wised up over the mcnugget incident, he kept a close eye on his stash until he finally had to go to sleep.  The next morning, one was missing.  He kept his rage in check and calmly ate the rest of the box of  in one sitting, one after another.  Whoever the thief was probably got pissed because when he came to our room later the cord to his head phones had been cut.  

Bonus: My brother accompanied me on a trip to Wal-Mart, but he whined that we were taking too long.  The checkout clerk was taking too long, too.  So he grabbed random bags of chips next to the register and crushed the contents to crumbs.  Then he put them back on the shelf.

I live ten minutes from the campus. I leave half an hour early for my morning class, just so I can get parking.

And then here comes this jerk. I was in the turn lane that leads into the campus when suddenly a car from the left veers directly in front of me and cuts me off.

But the beauty is, I'm thinking, this guy probably has to call hundreds of people before he's got a sucker on the line as willing and eager as I am to remedy this particular computer problem. So I do this cycle a full four times, each time giving him more little hints that I think the ""Windows Key"" is actually the power button. By the fourth time I thought for sure he would get it because I was calling it something like, ""the main Windows power button on my Dell,"" but sadly he never did figure it out. He gives up on that and moves on to try something else.

""Ok, sir, forget that, we will try something else."" He goes on to explain that we're going to do a boot-up sequence where I have to press the F8 key *while* the computer is booting back up. Obviously, this could not have worked out better. The chance to continually miss hitting the F8 key in time has me absolutely giddy inside. I assure him I'm ready to hit the key and restart the machine. 

I let it fully boot up and blare the Windows login sound again and say, ""OK! It's back on and I'm hitting the key now."" He sighs with more frustration. ""You have to do it WHILE THE COMPUTER IS STARTING BACK UP,"" he explains. So I apologize again and feign frustration myself while holding back my unfettered delight. 

The next round he is more careful to make sure I'm hitting the key *during* the boot-up sequence. So I'm punching away on the space bar key as loud as I can during the boot-up, and after a couple minutes or so here comes that beautiful Windows start up sound again and he lets out an even louder, more frustrated sigh.

""SIR. Did you hit the **F8** key?"" 

Well I've gone this far, I think to myself, I may as well lay on another level of frustration by insulting his English. ""Yes, I was hitting the ""S"" and ""H"" keys the whole time! I don't know what went wrong."" 

Yep, that did it. ""**No**, no, no, the F-8 key. The **F** - **8** key. Sir, look at your keyboard. Do you see the F8 key?"" 

""OH....Oh...the *F-8* key,"" I say. ""Yes, I see, I'll try again."" We sit there waiting a few more minutes. I repeat the whole process, this time after the start-up sound I tell him I hit the ""F"" and ""8"" keys but again nothing happened. Holy Shit. He's fuming at this point but trying as hard as he can to hold it back. Right then I heard my mom call that dinner was ready. Normally I would have blown off dinner for something this much fun but we'd grilled out these beautiful ribeyes and I wasn't about to let mine get cold. I tell him I'm really sorry, I have to go to dinner now and I will have to fix it later. And with that, after this 35 minute phone call, I just hang up. 

I sit at the table admiring this beautifully marbled steak and tell my folks it was all a scam and I was just wasting his time. The phone rings. My mom jumps up and says, ""I got it."" In the sweetest voice, my mom said, ""I'm really sorry but we are having family dinner at the moment and I have a rule that everyone has to sit down together,"" and after a moment listening to his reply she hangs up and sits back down. 

""What'd he say,"" I ask. Mom replies, ""He said, 'Fuck your family dinner'.""

Workacc1,51,107,1pmvl3,411,"So my roommate, who is a really cool dude usually, done fucked up last night. He works at a restaurant and gets off around 12. I'm guessing he decided to go to the bar last night, as he brought some broad back to our apt. No big deal, but this girl was a Class Alpha screamer. 

They start screwing around at 1:30 AM, I brush it off for an hour, then get noticeably up, smoked a cigarette, got water, and went to bed. They stopped around 3:30. To their credit they tried to be quiet after I got up, but I was up till at least 4.

I work a 9-5 and have to get up around 6 am. So I notice the purse still sitting on our coffee table. Perfect. Think I'm going to have coffee at home instead of getting it on the way to work.

Being as loud as possible press more clothes, with whistle going off, and on my way to the kitchen I got a genius idea.

Tightanium,87,249,1pm6r8,745,"I was out running errands last weekend, enjoying my time off from a stressful work week. I was walking out of the grocery store when I see a middle aged lady with grocery bags. she was looking through them, probably for a specific item because she made this face and began rummaging through her purse. she had maybe 5 or 6 grocery bags, and when she decided to go back in (i'm assuming for the missing item) she started taking the items out of their bags, placing them in her car, and just dropped the empty bags on the ground and locked her car and went back in.


okay bitch, game fucking on. 

it was time to do some recon. I snag the bags she left, put them in my car, and go in to see how far along she was on her second store trip. she was in the back of the store, in the dairy, milk, frozen section. PERFECT. I had AT LEAST 15 minutes. I headed to the tools/appliance section and immediately looked for some duct tape, clear tape, masking tape, whatever. 

I grab the clear tape, since it's by far the best (the kind that you use with tape guns) and I check out. I look around at the registers for the lady but she isn't around, meaning she's still shopping. again, PERFECT. I go out to my car, and grab her bags. the way she was parked made it so that she would walk up to the front of her car, she wouldn't even see the back. so I took the tape, cut some off, and taped one back to the underside of her car in the very back. I made it so that maybe if for some reason she was back there she might not see it. I proceeded to do this to each of the bags, so that when she gets going on her journey the bags will just be flapping in the wind and she will never know until someone tells her or she investigates herself. so I waited in my car for her to come out, and as luck would have it she didn't even get near the back of her car. she started it up, and zoomed off out of the parking lot. I follow her for maybe 2 miles, as I turned off the street toward my place, she still hadn't noticed, and the 6 bags were just a flappin in the wind.

When I returned to the house, my mom told me that some kids had taken ALL of our candy. This angered me, so I devised a plan; I was going to put more candy outside and wait for some kid to take all of it, and then I would go after him. I put out the candy and waited in a bush in my front yard, and sure enough, some older kids, probably eighth grade, came and poured all the candy into bags. They were laughing and talking about how awesome it was. I then proceeded to come out of the bush and say something like ""Hey! The sign says take two!"" At this point, the kids made the mistake of trying to run away. Naturally, I took off after them. Eventually during the chase, one of the kids tripped and fell on the ground. I approached him, grabbed his candy and said something like ""If you get to take all of my candy, I get to take all of yours."" I went home and put his candy into the bowl outside.

A bit of backround: I was a Junior taking a second year of chemistry because I didn't felt like I fully understood the material the first time. The class was mostly Sophomores. By the third six weeks I finally understood the material and had maintained a 90% average.

The story: One day our chemistry teacher told us to get into pairs of 4, and if you didn't have a group you were placed with one. I didn't really know anyone in the class so I sat there and waited to be placed in a group. Sadly I was placed with the three most annoying girls in the class. (They always had an excuse for not doing their homework and always talked during class) The teacher told us that we were going to have a contest to see which group could locate an element on the periodic table using only a starting point ( any element given), ionization energy, and atomic radius. First three groups to win gets a prize. He then tells the class to suggest prizes. This is the list.

1. Kool-Aid pickles
2. 10 point curve on exam
3. Homework pass
4. Doughnuts
5. Cupcakes

My mom manages the entire office of about 25 people. It's not telemarketing, but we did call people and do political polls. The system dials for us, and we read from a script on the computer. It's easy, but it gets monotonous.

Mom had two assistants at the time. One was this tub of lard William that just sat in the corner of her office, literally stinking up the place, and occasionally going to an empty workstation and listen in/monitor calls. The other was a white-haired guy Kevin, a bit nicer, but a total kiss-ass.

William keeps monitoring me, because now and then he'll come up behind me and give me pointers or tell me what I'm doing wrong. But really, though, all you do is read the script. If the person we called declined to do the poll, I can't force them to. This guy wanted me to be obnoxious on the phone. I wasn't having it, so I ignored his ""pointers"".

One day, my mom comes over and asks me to go into her office. No big deal, she's my mom. Probably nothing. Instead, she tells me that William had been monitoring me again, and that I was purposefully dropping calls, not completing polls, and just slacking off. William was sitting in the corner, looking at the walls and Kevin was standing next to him, nodding. Bunch of idiots.

I told my mom the accusations weren't true, and that the people in the cubicles around me can attest to that. But she wasn't having it. She told me to go home for the day.

My mom texted me later to tell me off for causing a scene and that I was officially fired. Whatever. I vowed to exact revenge.

He hadn't gotten far, so it wasn't long before I was able to merge in front of him and brake check him twice before getting to the next intersection.

I was ready to move on, but I discovered that the RAV 4 was still behind me. Time to have a little more fun.

NoodlesInTheWind,1,13,1pjpi5,60,"A little background: I work in a loan place, been here for a year. I'm a very quiet person and don't like confrontation. We give payday loans to all the employees in this area. The workplace has a little system going on and I walk to different offices to get required signatures. 


Story: One of my customers had forgotten to get a signature for their form (to get a loan) and of course I had no way to call this person back. Who doesn't have a cell phone? Anyway, I decide to do him the favor. I walk over next door to HR to get that signature. The office is very small and quiet. I go up to the lady in the front desk, Claudia, and ask in a polite voice, ""Hi morning, can I have your signature on this form?"" 

She ignores me. I have a tendency to speak in a very small voice so I try to say it louder. Still no response. The guy behind her asks why she's ignoring me. I see that she's on her phone browsing Facebook. At this point I'm getting annoyed and start to walk off. That's when she finally says ""What did you want?"" I get her signature and go back to my office.


A few days later.. She made a payday loan while I was away at class and she comes in to pick up her check later on. It was just me in the office since my other coworkers decide to take a long lunch. She comes in and I had my earphones on. My music wasn't very loud but I decide to play deaf. I can hear her say ""Hi I'm here to pick up my check"" ""Hello?"" ""Can you hear me?"" ""I'm here to pick up a check!"" She starts banging on my desk to get my attention. I let her stand there awkwardly for a while and go ""Oh! I'm so sorry, I didn't see you there.""

It was a bit cold outside, so decided I would head for the drive thru, not realising how busy it was until I got my car in the line. They just upgraded to a double order point, where the lane splits into two, then back into one once you have ordered. I have placed my order and Im sat behind another car as we both merge back into the single lane, we could both fit as the other side was taking time to order so there were no cars waiting. As I pulled forward, the 4x4 finished ordering, and floored it towards us, cutting me off and forcing me to stop quickly. She couldn't go any further forward, so just sat, staring straight ahead and blocked me from joining. My blood boiled, and I really wanted her to look at me so I could highlight my disappointment to her. Instead, she does the classic ""Ill play with my phone so I dont have to keep trying not to look at you"". We were sat for 3-4mins and the car in front of her pulled forward a cars length or so, but she was too busy playing snake or whatever to notice. So, I mounted the curb and pulled my car back in front (Having a hire car for 3 days was a result, as if I wasnt driving a Mini i wouldnt of been able to do it).

BaldimusIV,7,26,1pji65,160,"About 5 years ago, we rented our house out through an estate agent and went traveling for a year. Everything was fine and dandy until we were a few months into our trip and halfway across the country.

Out of the blue we receive a call from the estate agent saying that the tenants are going to press charges if we do not clean the pool in the yard of the house. This surprised my dad, since we had signed a contract which stated that the tenants would be looking after the property due to the fact that we were thousands of kilometers away for almost an entire year. 

At this point we discover that the tenants have a different contract to the one we signed before renting the house out. This was a major hassle for my dad while we were attempting to enjoy our trip, and he ended up having to organise and pay for a pool cleaner to deal with it in the meantime. 

After this, he talked to the real-estate agent and requested that he be reimbursed for the situation (the two different contracts, which differed only in the property management level) which escalated to the point where the agent told my dad to ""Take it to court or Piss off."" Taking the agent to court would have been too much of a hassle and would have cost too much over time for the attorney fees, court costs, etc, so we ignored the problem and broke ties with the agent as soon as we returned home.

The revenge?

FinalEnemy,157,619,1pj7o8,1524,"This happened a while ago, but I stumbled into this sub and figured it might fit. It’s work related, but I’m going to try to keep the job-specific jargon to a minimum.

Quick background:
I had been working at my job for a few years and decided to apply for the management program.  No easy task to even get in and when I went through 8% of the people who were accepted actually completed the course. The course was a major ball breaker and those in it were usually regarded as sub-human throughout. It sounds weird, but it was effective in trimming the fat. Those directly associated with the course were trained in the art of balancing this facade with actual learning points. The problem usually came from those who saw this and assumed it was cool to be an asshole too.

The actual story:

I get told that I’m going to continue my course and the horrific jobs that entailed, but also drive the big boss around and play chauffeur for a while.  I go to the guy in charge of the vehicles and other logistical boringness and get the boss’s vehicle and go about my way. Dude was uber douche throughout our entire interaction – I’ll call him Major Douche. After days of babysitting this stupid truck and massive amounts of arduous awfulness it comes time to head back to the main complex and return to some semblance of normalcy.  I park the boss’s truck in the boss’s reserved spot, boss leaves and I start taking care of things that need to be done. Putting the boss’s work truck back is on the list, but not the top.

I return about an hour later to an empty parking spot. These work trucks do not have keys. Super. Someone stole my boss’s truck that I’m responsible for. We were somewhere where anyone not working in the same place wouldn’t have access to the truck, so it wasn’t in a chop shop. Being optimistic (which never works out well for me), I walk across the street to MAJ Douche’s office. MAJ Douche knew I was coming to him with this truck and maybe he saw it and just took it back saving me an errand. Nope.
MAJ Douche shifts into maximum-over-douche and tries to take a page from the instructors’ handbook.  So after an obscenely condescending ‘I-got-you-now-fucker’ speech he essentially denies having the truck (I gleaned he did and was hiding it ‘to teach me a lesson’) and smugly sends me on my way because, “if [I] don’t find it, [I’m] done for. Figure it out!” 

I am in no mood.

So instead of panicking and running around on the impossible scavenger hunt like he expected as he chuckled his way back to his office, I walk my ass straight to the complex’s police station (we have our own cops. Not security guards. Arrest power, throw your ass in jail cops). I find two cops and explain the situation. I tell them I’m in the management course and MAJ douche has issued a ‘learning challenge’ of sorts and I’m supposed to figure out how to properly handle it.  The senior cop laughs and says, “MAJ Douche? I fucking hate that guy. We’re in!”

I watched from a comfortable distance as the cops roll in and smugly say they are investigating grand theft auto and he was the prime suspect and in a world of hurt.  Quivering and sweating he threw out his side of the story and the cops played it better than I could have imagined. This went on for 15 glorious minutes. Eventually he led them to his locked hiding place and all was well.

The big boss walked out of his building and asked me what the hell was going on. I explained how I was overcoming a training related challenge and told the story. He laughed and we stood together and watched the rest of the drama unfold.  

The cops left and I walked over. “Hey sir, I see we got the truck back. Good news, huh?” He glared and stormed off. I throw in a, “Sir, isn’t that what I should have done with a stolen vehicle?” He slams the door.  I engaged smug face myself and turned back across the road. 

*I know, technically, I did have the truck stolen from me and I’m an asshole. But, technically, in that situation one would report it to the cops. He started the ‘technically’ game and I saw it through.*

It's always been this way, so I get there early to give myself a chance to cool down. That way I'm not walking into work looking like a cherry tomato.

One night a few weeks ago I locked up my bike and sat down on the grass to cool down. I was sitting in front of a vacant parking space. A lady in a Lexus SUV pulled into the spot, put her car in park and just sat there. 

There are not very many people who work the night shift at my job, we all know each others cars, I didn't recognize her or her car. I thought maybe she had picked up a shift for someone and was just taking a second to get her things. After a few minutes it became clear she was just going to be sitting there for an undetermined amount of time. 

She was blabbing away on her cell phone. I tried putting my hand over my eyes as a passive agressive ""your lights are blinding me"" move. It worked to no avail. I was ignored. She made eye contact with me once or twice and then just went right back to blabbing. I was starting to get irritated.

colespudzo,4,3,1phyu2,48,"Back when I was eight I was enrolled in my local lacrosse league. Now, I'm not a very large kid so naturally I wasn't the best. This made me an easy target to get picked on. Another hobby that I picked up a few years ago was American karate. Similar to MMA, this involves lots of punches, kicks and unnecessary fancy embellishments. At the time in my karate class, we had been practicing tornado kicks. These kicks involve lots of spinning and at the end of the spins you would jump up and roundhouse kick your target. If you couldn't tell, it would hurt a lot to get hit with one of these.

Back to lacrosse. Over the next few days I've been practicing this kick a lot to myself, because it's a lot of fun and I have extra energy. It's the middle of a practice and I'm running to the back of the line and I do a spin and pretend to kick the air. One of the kids pipes up really loudly and says ""what are you doing, ballet?"". This being a group of eight-year-olds, they immediately all started yelling ""ha ha he's doing ballet!"" I tell the kid who started it ""I'm just practicing something for karate""

Obviously the kid did not believe me. He said ""ha! prove it! You're too small to be doing karate""

Now I'm pretty passive kid, but this guy had been giving me shit all year. So I decided I would prove it. I started doing spins in his direction and after about five of them, even though I was a little bit dizzy, I still gave the hardest kick I'd ever thrown straight into his gut. Anybody who's ever played lacrosse will know that you were padding over your stomach, but this guys still obviously felt it. My skinny eight-year-old muscles managed to send this kid, who was much bigger than me, at least 5 feet backwards. It was the single greatest, and yet the single worst, feeling I had ever experienced. I was so afraid that he was going to get me in trouble. But out of fear of looking weak he stood up, took a large sniffle and shut up about it. He never gave me crap again, but to this day I still haven't told anybody. ",Make fun of my moves?

Gidiggly,6,17,1phmec,78,"It was a cold October night a few years back when my friends and I all crammed inside my car to head across the state line to Illinois, headed off to visit an epic haunted corn maze.  We were aglow with excitement.

As we were driving, we went to merge onto an off ramp.  After putting on our blinker, instead of slowing down to let us over, this asshole car decides to speed up.  Our exit was coming up and I had no choice but to get over anyway.  This angered the asshole car and they proceeded to tailgate me.

As soon as the lanes opened up, they sped around.  I assumed they would speed off into the night and that would be the end of it.  Instead, they tried to HIT MY CAR.  They (a family of three that looked like they just crawled out of a Deliverance daydream) attempted to side-swipe my car and I had just enough room to swerve to avoid them.

As we crossed the state line, they kept pace with us - shining flashlights into my car.  It was the flashlights that tipped me off that they were likely headed to the same place we were.  So I had my friends memorize their license plate number so I could exact my revenge.

drunkenpizzatoss,17,23,1phalq,127,"This past weekend I was in an Undisclosed City for a friends wedding. He'd gotten married on Saturday evening and I was out at a bar with about a dozen after-partiers late in to the night/early morning. After drinking for the better part of the past 12 hours the group collectively decided to call it quits at last call, which was around 2am. Despite the fact everyone in the group was staying a short walk away at a handful of hotels all on the same block, I became separated from the group on our walk from the bar to the hotels. I likely saw something shiny and became distracted. I couldn't say how, but after losing my group I managed to find a pizza place that was still open and serving food. No slices were left, but if I wanted to wait they'd make me a full pie. At the time this sounded like a reasonable compromise. Why not order a full pepperoni pizza at 3am?

I waited about 20 minutes for the pizza, paid for it, walked out on to the sidewalk and to the corner of the block. It's at this point that I realize I'm not 100% certain which direction my hotel is. I'm pretty sure it's that way, but I think I came from over there, and what the hell is that sound? It sounds like some one running down the stree - **BAM** - Sure enough, some dude came running around the corner and bumped into me, knocking the fresh pepperoni pizza out of my hands and on to the sidewalk.

However, none of this negates the fact that this stranger unapologetically and without any sign of remorse caused the destruction of an entire fucking pizza I paid for and received less 2 minutes earlier! 

""I'm FUCKING *STANDING HERE*, ASSHOLE!"" I shout to him as he continues down the sidewalk, away from me. 

""FUCK YOU!"" he shouts back, unlocking and getting in to the drivers side of a car parked about 30 feet away. On a one way street. A one way street which would take him directly back to the corner where I was assessing my wrecked pizza. After a cursory inspection it was obvious the pizza was a total loss. 

It became crystal clear what I had to do. 

I scooped the hot mass of cheese and dough and sauce and greasy pepperoni back into the box from whence it spilled. As this insufferable asshole pulled up to the red light at the intersection I let fly the box of mangled pizza. I could not have aimed better had I been sober. The pizzabox was a direct hit on the vehicles windshield, a greasy explosion of all that once was my pepperoni pizza.

Turns out at her new college, (she took loans to follow Harry to his dream college, they both are now in a local college because it was to expensive for either of them) she met people who knew me. 

All these people are in her ""dream"" programs and clubs. They ask her where she's from and what high school, when she tells them where she's from several of them mention me, and ask if she knew me. 

Her reaction? 

Of course, she and I are best friends and keep in contact **all the time** 

My friends wonder why I never mention her, so they bring her up. 

I tell all of them I've only heard of her, and never in my life talked to her. We have mutual friends but that is all. My college friends now avoid her too.

Me: ...Who is this?

Woman: *hangs up*

I am fed up with random calls from people on a daily basis. I've been answering telemarketer calls lately just so that I can tell them I'm not interested, because when I ignore the call they just keep calling. The annoying thing is that most of the time when I politely say I'm sorry I'm not interested, they hang up... on me. I'm so sorry for intruding on your day, please carry on, telemarketer. Like seriously? You couldn't at least say ""sorry, thank you for your time, etc.""??

And this one lady calls me expecting me to know who the fuck she is, apparently.

So I called the number back and didn't say anything when she picked up. I did this twice and she got to sound like an idiot saying ""Hello? .... Helloooo?"" And I think I will keep the number and call it in the middle of the night tonight.

There was this hostess who would have a total fit if a lowly wait person touched the podium while she was on duty. She barely tolerated the managers disturbing her holy altar of hostessing. If a lowly wait person did touch her podium, she'd screw us later not seating us then slamming our sections.

Anyway, the Saturday and Sunday morning rushes usually started at 9 am and ran to 2 pm but I always was scheduled for 6 am while The Holy Hostess (HH) usually came in at 8.

One quiet morning, I happened to notice a screw on the floor in the hostess area but I was heading into the kitchen so I just picked it up and kept moving.   

As it turns (ha!) out, the screw was from the underside of the hostess podium and HH had ""the day from hell"" because the podium was all wobbly and pouted until one of the managers found the extra screws and fixed it.

Well.  You know what that means right?  A small Phillips head screw driver became a permanent part of my waitperson kit and every few weeks, I'd take a moment and loosen a few screws before HH showed up.

DaBev,3,12,1pevxa,64,"**The Background:** Our apartment complex's super (hear after refereed to as Super Douche or SD) used to be a childhood friend of my fiance's and a frequent flyer in our friend group. That is until he decided to rip off my fiance's family by doing shoddy, coked-out repair work on a housing renovation that cost at least 10k more than it should have. We're talking 3/4ths dry wall patched where it needed to be 1/8th, not properly caping pipes and flooding the place multiple times and ruining thousands of dollars of new floor that they put in before they finished repairing everything...you name it this chucklefuck fucked it up, all in the name of a ""learning experience."" Needless to say the whole family was extremely disappointed and pissed, especially Grandma who the house was for and my fiance, who originally recommended his former friend. Unfortunately, months before this we began renting the place where we are now, and haven't been able to find anything so far to get out and away from SD and his shitty maintenance (oh, there are many a tale of shitty apartment repairs after this fiasco as well). 

**The Revenge:**
Now, while I would love to key SDs brand new truck he got after ripping off the fam, to be honest he's far to unstable, coked out, and crazy for that sort of revenge to be let go without a physical confrontation in which I would lose fantastically.

frothy_please,18,53,1petwc,299,"For those who don't know the tube trains in London, the trains rock from side to side (sometimes quite violently) and it's most advisable to hang onto something if you are standing up (like one of the handily-placed rails which are there just for that specific purpose, and in easy reach).

But if you are going to the financial sector (Canary Wharf), there's a lot more arrogant people. They try to ""tube surf"" - stand upright without holding on to anything. Usually while reading and holding the book or newspaper with both hands. And they can never suppress their smirks as they show off, nor avoid casting glances around to see who has noticed and is impressed. 

Here's a clue: nobody is impressed.

Why? Because everyone in the carriage knows the sort of idiot who does that. And knows that they only remain upright because the carriage is so packed. They really rely on falling against other people - not very hard, but quite often, and it's highly annoying to get the constant thud-thud-thud against you.

And every other commuter knows this because it's happened to all of us. You tube-surfer: you are not big, and you are not clever. You are a selfish arse failing to show off by using other people's bodies as cushions to break your fall.

So when I commuted there, I developed a habit: check if the people next to me are holding on to anything. If not, position my elbow so that if they move in my direction enough that they are going to make contact, then their head collides with my elbow before any other part of them touches me. It's quite easy to do it and still look natural; just hold the rail at whatever point gives the desired elbow-location.

For those occasions when an overhead rail isn't available, jutting the elbow out slightly behind one serves almost as well. Or, if one has an umbrella, the handle can be used to great effect, and still be tucked tightly against one, so as not to inconvenience others. It just has to be an inch in front of whatever part of ones body will be the designated target-cushion by the surfer. I recommend a good solid wooden handle.

It was so satisfying to feel the bump and then to see that all of a sudden they decided that holding the rail was in fact a sensible idea (who would have guessed?), and that their violent swaying had thus been replaced with a much more stable arrangement. 

Some of them took two or three bumps to get the message. But they generally got the message. The ones with their backs to me, who didn't expect it, were the most gratifying. Good solid thuds, they enjoyed, when they were expecting the usual soft, cushioning fall of another commuter's body.

mkpow,13,26,1peil9,6,"So I will try to explain this as simply as possible because it may get a little complicated.

I was born and raised Catholic. Not SUUUUPER Catholic, like, we go on Christmas and Easter, so..a good Catholic. Anyway, there are seven sacraments in Catholicism, one of them being Confirmation. Which is basically being accepted into the church as an adult. When you get confirmed, you need to have a ""sponser"". A ""sponser"" is someone who guides you through the long-fucking-ordeal that is confirmation. Like, answering questions about the Jesus and what-not. For some, it's a very rewarding passage of life and many thoroughly enjoy it and take it as a big celebration. 

This isn't really the case for my family. We do fulfill every basic need to be a part of the church, but without having to contribute much. (I say ""we"", I mean my family, I hadn't been inside a church since this last Sunday in about two years.)  Well, this past Sunday, it was my younger sister's confirmation and I was her sponser. As it could be assumed, I didn't do a whole lot up to this point. I don't live where the parish is because I am away at college, so I met the basic needs of being a sponser, which was showing up. 

Since it was a church service, everyone is required to dress up and look nice. Me, being a broke-ass-bitch, wore the nicest thing I owned which was heels, a really nice blouse, and some black leggings. It looked nice enough for church and my parents even remarked about how nice I looked. Which I took as a win because I had been very drunk the night before and had to get up early to drive to this event.

As my sister and I were waiting with about a hundred other kids to go inside this parish, I get pulled aside by the church coordinator. This woman and I have never seen eye to eye. When I was in Catechism, (the easiest way I can explain this is Catholic Sunday school for kids 1st-11th grade), I used to ask difficult questions about Church doctrine looking for explanation. She just wanted me to accept it at face-value. That wasn't going to happen. So we were stand-offish toward each other. 

She explains to me she pulled me aside because my attire was a poor-choice and was a little risque. What was she referring to..? My leggings. Heaven forbid you can see the shape of my rump. She then proceeds to pull out a giant as scarf and make me tie it around my waist so it covered everything to the end of my knees. I looked ridiculous.  For two hours I sat with this thing around my waist. I attempted not to make a HUGE deal out of it because it was my sister's day and so on an so forth; however, I wasn't feeling to well after throwing back some PBRs and Grain Belt (Beer) the previous night.

I'm not going to be modest here, I had beer farts. The were terrible and smelly. I wouldn't wish these on anyone; however, except for the church coordinator who happened to put her scarf around my waist. You can imagine what I did for those two hours of mass.

JrockMem10,17,25,1pdep7,173,"So I was 22 and had just bought my house. I bit off more than I could chew so took on a roommate who was a friend of mine. He was a cop working nights and I worked days so it worked out great. When the muggy Summer heat kicked in, we started having some conflict over the A/C. 

Basically he had to have it ice cold in the house so he could still sleep under his big comforter during the day. It kept blowing fuses, throwing the breaker &amp; worst of all the utility bill was outrageous. So I was like look man, 68 deg is plenty cool inside when it's 90 out. Just leave the thermostat where I set it, it's reasonable and it's my house. 

Well of course he completely ignored me and would have it on the lowest setting every day so it constantly ran still. He wasn't very knowledgeable about electrical as I found out when I had to show him what the fuse panel next to the dryer was for. So one morning before I went to work and during a god awful heat wave, I went to the safety shutoff by the outside unit and pulled it out just enough to disconnect it. I could barely contain the laughter inside when I got home that day. He was sprawled out on the couch in his boxers with a wet rag on his head and 3 fans blowing on him. ""Jroooock! It's so hot man, the AC is out and it's not the breaker or fuses, I checked!"" So I played it off like, ""man I told you to just leave the thermostat where I put it, see what you did!"" Heh. I fiddled around in the fuse panel for a while, but put the cutoff back before he left for work and told him I had it fixed but it would keep happening unless he quit turning it down every day. Problem solved...",A/C out again?? Hehe,198
Loah,12,22,1pdaut,131,"A bit of background: I live in Australia. We are heading into the hottest months of the year and there isn't a lot of rain where I live. As a result, our grass is non existent. It's more like a dust patch with some straw at this point.

The offence: my neighbours have an unusual amount of cars. Most of the time there is 5 and when they can't find anywhere to park, they park in front of my house. Not so bad but we have two cars and like to park our own car here and not three doors down.

The revenge: today I noticed they were parked in front of our house once again....with all the car windows down. I thought it would be the perfect time to mow my dust patch!

DarylAndMerle,2,17,1pdaj4,2,"Long time reader, first time poster and boy do I have stories I want to post.

Ok so some background: My sister is 1 and a half years older than me and she is so fucking annoying to say the least. She would continously tell me about herself and annoy me to hell (which I think would be a refuge from her) but if I did it she would just sulk and either go tell my mum or just downright piss me off even more. She thinks she is a princess and im her peasant, she always plays the 'im older than you so you have to respect me card' which I have no trouble with until she comes into my room and takes anything she wants to keep it without asking. Blah blah blah more shit about her. To the offense.

I got home yesterday before her which I always do and instead of what I usually do (mucking around and just going on reddit) I started my work straight away and whenever I do homework (im in my last year and need to get my shit together) I listen to music. Well, my sister on this particular evening comes home and obviously not being able to get my attention she called me. Ok no problem, she always leaves me outside for a few minutes while she finishes her shitty make up or whatever. I go to open the door and say im sorry I didnt hear because I had my earphones on and she just lights UP. I mean nostrils flaring fire type. Telling me about how stupid I am and how im a dick etc. Ok sis, you fucked up. Hard.

Hey sis, wouldnt it be a shame if I followed you around whistling and camped outside your room till my head got dizzy and my lips hurt? Yeah. I did.

budgetwhale,16,13,1pcqrj,63,"I live in a pretty spread out subdivision and park my car at the top of my driveway every single day.  My neighbors recently inherited some money and their attitude has changed significantly. I've had a couple of minor issues with them in the past. Every time that someone's vehicle is parked on the road in front of my house, they call the cops and report it. My subdivision has a rule that cars can not be parked on a ""non-hard"" surface and when people park in front of my house, they pull slightly off the road to make more room for any passing cars. However, if the car was parked fully on the street, it wouldn't be an issue. Anyway, a couple of weeks ago my dad was doing some yard work and had his truck parked in the middle of our driveway to unload some mulch. I parked my car on the street for maybe 3 hours and then moved it back into the driveway when he was finished. A few days later I received a written warning from the local law enforcement that my car was not to be parked on a non-hard surface. I knew it was my neighbors and I know that their bedroom is the front room of their house, with a large window facing the street. Every night before turning on my road, I turn my radio up to full volume and turn on my brights so that they shine into their bedroom window. Take that!

Sweet, sweet revenge!",Talk behind me the entire movie will ya?,87
TokisCodpieceBZZZ,23,24,1pcdqk,89,"So this story is probably more backstory than revenge, but oh well.

**Backstory:**  I am the second youngest in my entire extended family.  The person closest in age is my brother, who I can't stand.  The next closest is my younger cousin Leah.  She and I were also the only females in this generation.  Naturally, I used to try to form a bond or whatever with her, which never really happened because she's sporty and I'm not, she's really looks-driven and I'm not, I'm kinda geeky and she's not, etc.  

As a side-note, she's always needed a lot of affirmation from others that she's pretty, that she's loved, that she's good at cooking, that she's loved, etc.  This resulted in years of insecurity, being used by guys who would convince her to put out quickly in order to earn their love, and for a while she developed an eating disorder.

So on X-mas Eve a couple years ago, she gets trashed.  Apparently she cries when she's drunk, and suddenly she wants to spend time with me.  She's bawling about how she has no friends, she's so lonely, she's miserable, blah blah blah.  So I offer to hang out with her sometime, and she's ecstatic.  She seemed convinced that I didn't really like her (meanwhile, I spent years thinking she didn't really like me).  So we decide to hang out for a few days in January, while my aunt and uncle are out of town.  We can have some drinks, she'll have me sit through the Harry Potter movies, we can girl talk or whatever.  Sounds good, and I get pretty excited.

I shoot her a message over Facebook a few days later to confirm that she remembers, as she was awfully drunk.  She remembers, and realizes that my birthday is that week, so she'll totally buy me a drink.  Now that I have this confirmation, I ask for time off of work for a few days.  This is particularly irritating, because at the time I had a shitty part-time job at a donut shop.  Not only could I not really afford the time off, but also my boss hated when I'd ask for time off, so she'd cut additional hours off of my work week out of spite because she knew I needed the money.  I also pushed off a date with a guy I'd been into, because I figured my cousin really wanted the company.

The week of my visit comes, and I realize I don't have Leah's address, so I call her to ask for it.  It rings once, and then goes to voicemail - usually an indicator that the call has been ignored.  Uhh... okay.  Maybe she was busy.  So I leave a message, and wait until that night before sending a text.  Still no answer by the next afternoon, the day before my visit, so I shoot her a Facebook message.  No response.

So I make alternate plans, and by the end of the weekend I'm PISSED that I haven't even gotten a ""sorry, I was camping and my phone died"" or ""oh shit I completely forgot, maybe another time.""  Y'know, any acknowledgement that she stood me up.  That pissed me off way more than her flaking out on me.

**Revenge:**  Thing is, there are two things that Leah is particularly proud of when we have family get-togethers: dressing up, and baking something for dessert.  So, over a year and a half later, at my grandpa's birthday party, I get my revenge.  I start Googling dessert recipes, and then I go to the grocery store.  I blow $40 on eggs, sugar, graham cracker crumbs, cream cheese, vanilla extract, butter, and raspberries, and I make the most goddamn delicious raspberry cheesecake I could ever hope to make.  Then I dress up in some of my nicer clothes, with my hair freshly done.  Still won't compare to her if she dresses up, because she's got the body of a swimmer, and I've got the body of someone who's trying to get out of a bad relationship with fried foods.  Mmm, mozzarella sticks.

I get to the party, and I see Leah making guacamole... dressed in sweats.  I immediately start getting compliments on how nice I look, how I've lost weight, how nice my hair is, blah blah blah, and I see Leah get a little irritated.  When she asked people how her guacamole was, she got a lot of, ""Oh, it was good.""  When we get to my cheesecake at the end of the night, everyone gushes over it.  ""Oh my god, Toki, you need to give me this recipe!  Can you make this from now on?""  

Oh hell yes.  Who's the better chick now, bitch?!

Lately, this one lady comes in like clockwork on Fridays, when we are slammed, right in the middle of rush.

Because I wanted a good grade, I obviously participated in the required number of studies.

Come spring, several months after I've completed the class, I start getting emails from the researchers asking for me to come back in.  Because the class is over, I'm not obligated to help.  They know this, so they offer money.  Their first offer was worth less than my time at work, as was the second, as was the third, so I ignored those emails. 

I get a fourth offer with an amount of money I would be willing to participate for, but I see that I have a conflict and won't be able to make it, so I again ignore the email.  Important: they said this would absolutely be the **last** offer.  Oh well I thought.

Sometimes when the daycare workers got tired of us, they'd say ""naptime!"" and they would roll out blankets for everyone. While we were laying down and it seemed like everyone was asleep, the daycare ladies would go out and smoke real quick (yes, I already know how they are in the wrong for leaving us alone). I got up and snuck over and grabbed some glue from the crafting table, I proceeded to place it in dumbass' hair, I went to sleep and woke up to dumbass crying, his hair was ruined and sticking together and his mom had to take him home to wash it out. In my mind I thought he would have to get it cut off, but it didn't work like that. 

I never got caught, but I felt good about it, petty revenge is so fun!

This one guy was leveled another guy. Like it wasn't even called for the player who get hit wasn't even going for the puck. Of course the ref is going to call a penalty on him for roughing, but his guy didn't get it. He spent the entire penalty swearing and making rude/hateful remarks about the refs, the other player and for some reason myself. (For some reason he thought it was my fault that he hit the other player and got a penalty.) Just before the penalty expires he pushes me out of the way so he could get back on the ice (I'm the one who is suppose to open and close the door for the players at the box). But the rule is you have to wait in the box till the a stop in the play before you can leave the box, but a player from your bench can go out for you till the stop in play. So the ref's see this and calls to many men on the ice for this guys team. Guess who get sent to the box again? He was even more cheerful this time!  It doesn't pay to be rude and try to get out quicker. His team ended up losing the game.

Often the job is filled with older people (best bagger's ever) but on times and days when there is no school there is often a flood of teens on the job. They take turns packing and helping take out carts to peoples cars in hopes of earning some cash.

I finished up shopping and the cashier that was checking me out had two bagger's both of them where teens. At first I was unloading the cart so I didn't know how slow both of the bagger's where nor how engrossed in their own conversation was that they didn't realize it themselves. Slowly the cashier had rung all of my groceries up and I was paying, noting that the baggers where still not half way through packing them. I look over and see about 7 more baggers waiting for their turn. Yet these two where still working at a snails pace and there was another person ready to be rung up behind me. The cashier can't even start the next person till all my groceries are bagged. FINALLY after another minute of waiting on these too to conclude their conversation they finally finish bagging and one of them start pushing the cart of food (slowly might I add) after me. While I had my back to him I pull out of my wallet the tip I was going to give him. Usually I give about 4-5 dollars because I usually get great service and I buy a lot of food. But I only pulled out 2. We get to my car and I open up the back. And he starts putting the food in just as fast as he was bagging. I start in on the cart grabbing 5 bags at a time, tired of waiting on this kid. Get all my groceries in and had the kid his tip wadded up to look like more then 2 dollars.

Lyn_Prayre,12,30,1p91a6,87,"
To all those that are reading this, I'd like you to remember your childhood games that you always played while you we're in primary school. It may have been football (American), football (soccer), football (Aussie Rules), football (touch) or any kind of sport which you played. No matter what the sport, you played it and you god damn loved it.

Anyway, the story began while I was the wee young age of 11, and in the fifth year of primary school. It was just the beginning of our lunch break, and it was a Friday, which is somewhat significant as this is the day when students tend to buy themselves a lunch order. Myself and about four of my friends and acquaintances were playing the legendary game of handball during this time.

For those who are not familiar with handball, be prepared for a terrible explaination of the basic rules. This isn't as relevant to the story, so you may wish to skip this paragraph. There is a king square and dunce square, with one player occupying one of the two squares. You lose as king, you swap places with dunce. You lose as dunce, you go to the back of the line and next person goes in. To play, you bounce the ball on your square on first bounce, and in the opponent's on second bounce. (They may play it back before second bounce) To win, the opponent has to miss the ball, or not play it legally. (Lobbed it, Double bounced, or landed out) Any extra rules could be applied upon agreement.

Anyway, we were playing 2 square handball with a basketball, and having a joyous time. Me and my friend Sam were having a blast, as we couldn't seem to get the other one out, and it was getting quite competitive. I was king, so I had the serve.

'*C'mon Lyn, you know what to do. Don't let him play close, make him go as far back as humanly possible.*'

It was time. I gave him a high bouncing ball, which somehow landed legally inside his square by mere centimetres. He was forced to go back and play a shot of equal qualities. It was then, when this Year 7 girl I'd like to call Twat-Waffle interfered by smacking the ball away from the area, stopping our game.

Now to be fair she wasn't much of a bully and she had a fair amount of friends at the time, but she would always do this kind of crap to the students who played handball for some reason. This is why she is dubbed as Twat-Waffle.

She was just standing on the right side of the handball area, waiting for play to restart so she could smash the ball again. I was pissed off, as this was the third time this week that she had done this to me. One thing I had noted while waiting for someone in line to get the ball was something of interest in her hand, a brown paper bag, holding something which I could not see.

So I did what any rational 11 year old would do at the time, I prepared another high bounce serve, but aimed a little to the right. I served towards her, somehow hitting the lunch order  and making her lose her grasp on said lunch as she watched it sail towards the ground...

**Thump**

As we looked down, my face turned into devilish glee as I saw the result. There was a brown liquid seeping from the bag, a liquid that looked like chocolate milk. What was even better was that when she picked up the bag, we could see that it ruined the other item in the bag, which was a hotdog. While this was not the result I was originally looking for, (I may have wanted to hit her head with the ball, but this happened seven years ago so I could be wrong) it provided laughs for the people who had actually saw what had happened.

I am so happy that I wasted the $5.00 she spent on this lunch.

neilswank,14,40,1p8z17,55,"Last Sunday afternoon I was at the Ikea in Burbank with my girlfriend. So now I have to inform everyone I don't live anywhere near Burbank and so I had an hour drive each way. 

So we do the usual walk through the maze that is Ikea (I still love it) and finally make our way to the check out area downstairs. We find a line and only have two carts in front of us. 

From at least four check out lanes over comes sauntering some guy, maybe in his late 40's, and he proceeds to walk right in front of us. At first I assumed he might have been looking at something to buy that happened to be alongside our line. BUT NO. He stood there for a few seconds and faced forward turning his back to us.

I thought no way this guy's for real. I say loud enough for everyone in our line and to either side of ours to hear, ""Hey?"" He turns around looks at me, makes eye contact then waves his hands in the air. He called the rest of his family up to join him in line. 

""SERIOUSLY?! This is actually happening?!"" I yell and he is definitely looking right at me the whole time, but of course now is the time he can't understand English or that this isn't socially acceptable. 

I start getting upset and my girlfriend can see it, she grabs our cart and tells me to follow her. Two lanes over the line was empty and we just made it before a couple other carts trying to move from their original lanes.

We quickly finish paying for our stuff (didn't buy a lot) and start heading to the exit. At the last minute it came to me: FUCK. THAT. GUY.

Perpendicular to this douche's check-out lane is the customer service desk. I walk over to the window and inform two Ikea employees that I saw his son stashing small items in his mother and sister's purses. I make sure that I make eye contact with the guy and use an adequate amount of hand gestures towards him and his family so he will definitely know where the inevitable stop and search came from.

As I walked out I couldn't help myself but to turn around at the automatic doors to see multiple Ikea associates surrounding his check-out register. It felt good, too good for really accomplishing nothing, but good none the less.

callmecinnamon,9,23,1p8snx,41,"So like the many other people working in the service industry, I'm just a minimum wage slave who has to put up with assholes all day. Because I work at a movie theatre, I get to put up with the full array of dickbags. There's the people bitching about ticket prices in the box office, underage douchbags trying to sneak into movies, and people who decide to ignore me when I tell them where their theatre is, and then later come back to ask for directions. But there's really no way to get back at them while working in the box office or as an usher. Working in concessions is a whole other monster. 

Not only while working in concessions do I have to listen to people bitch about the prices (literally with 99% of transactions), but there are a select set of people who piss me off like no other. For instance, people who order something, like a large coke, and don't tell me until after I finished filling it that they wanted no ice. Or those who wait until their popcorn is ready to let me know they wanted to butter it halfway through. Not to mention the people who just ignore me, or are too busy with their phones, to pay attention. I swear, the majority of people I serve are shitpiloting douche canoes. 

Now that I've worked there a few months I've developed the perfect, petty revenge for any customer who decides to piss me off. It's really a simple set of steps. 

1. Give them all the ice. Now you may be thinking that I give them a lot of ice, but I give them ALL. THE. ICE. Oh, you didn't want a lot of ice? Enjoy it filled to the brim with my frosty anger. By the time I'm through, it's more ice than soda. Have fun with the soda'd downed ice, prick. 

2. Don't fluff up the popcorn bag. Our theater uses bags instead of buckets, so you have to fluff them up well to be able to use the entire thing and get the max amount of popcorn. But fuck that noise. I barely open it so the bottom remains flat, making sure the bourgeois isn't getting as much popcorn as they could have, had they not been a douche. 

3. Forcibly give them their receipt. The majority of people don't want their receipts, so I just like to force it into their hands. Sometimes they even end up with three, four, maybe even five separate receipts which they get to have crinkle up in their purse or pocket when I could have easily thrown it away for them. Hah! 

4. On the rare occasion one of those cockgobblers orders a slushy I do one of two things. I'll give them just enough slush that it fills the cup, but leaves like two inches of emptiness in the dome of the lid. Or, if I'm feeling especially naughty, I'll fill it up so full that by the time it gets to them, it has expanded enough that it overflows and spills all over the lid. Enjoy your sticky hands.

PurpleSunSpots,16,15,1p8rcr,70,"I am the opening clerk at a gas station/mini mart in a small town.  We're not in a truly rural area, but we can nearly see one from here.

Every workday morning, I open the store at 5:00 AM and immediately begin to brew the coffee, as people generally start shuffling in zombielike in search of their first cup 'o caffeine around 5:15.  Generally.

Except His Royal Highness Gary, who has no doubt that he is the most important person on the planet.  He is also *very* particular about his gas station coffee.  He only likes one of the three blends, and he just *has* to have it within five minutes of brewing.  If it's any older than that, it's not fit for his royal palette, and he will demand that I dump out the pot and make a fresh one just for him.

Not happening.  What does happen (when I refuse) is that I am subjected to verbal abuse for several minutes before he storms off and peels out of the parking lot.  This is an almost daily occurrence because he can't seem to understand that I brew coffee for dozens of people, not just him, and that he needs to show up when it's fresh enough for him if that's how he wants it. 

He is also convinced that he has every right to park in our only handicapped spot, despite the fact that we actually have several disabled regular customers who *need* that spot - often while he is taking it up with his obnoxious, conspicuous consumption, unnecessarily large, see-how-important-I-am vehicle. 

I have asked him to please park elsewhere on many occasions, to no avail.

Yesterday, after having to explain to him *again* that if he wants 5 minute coffee, he needs to arrive between 5:05 and 5:10 (the blend he likes is the one I always make first, as it is the most popular, and it takes 5 minutes 30 seconds to brew), and having to deal with another tirade, I had had enough of his shit.

So at the end of my shift, I poured all of the leftover coffee (all three blends) from the ""old"" dispensers (that would normally be dumped) and carefully saved it in a spare container in the 'fridge.  I let my coworker know what I had planned for it, and she agreed not to touch it.

This morning, I took it out, microwaved the hell out of it, poured it into the usual dispenser, and put the dispenser under the coffee machine to make it look as though it had *just* finished brewing.

When Gary finally came in, he filled up his travel thermos, got his usual cigarettes, paid, and left.

I hope he enjoyed not enjoying his morning coffee today.

bonrmagic,13,99,1p7i4s,298,"I posted this in an /r/askreddit thread and was directed to post it here too. Happened a while ago... 2005 I think.

In high school my favourite teacher (Grade 9 biology) fell ill and was forced to miss the rest of the year. So we had a substitute for 3/4 of the school year. Now this lady knew absolutely NOTHING about teaching or biology. She also had a thick accent so it was impossible to understand what she was saying most of the time.

The class was out of control. Like a fucking zoo. I remember one class some guys in the back broke open a bunch of glow sticks and threw them at the front of the class spewing neon liquid jizz everywhere.
As for me, she hated me. I have no idea why. I'll admit I wasn't the best student, I didn't really care about the class or subject... But I never really acted out like some of the other kids. Regardless, she just despised me. Would always call me out for things I wasn't doing and kick me out of class for trivial things like whispering to my friend next to me. All the while the maniacs in the back are setting fires in the desks or cackling as loud as they can. It was insane.

During a test/quiz one day my pencil became dull and I started fishing in my school bag for my sharpener. She sees my hand rustling around at the bottom of my bag and promptly stands up to walk towards me. This bitch swipes the test off of my desk and writes a giant '0' on the paper. I exclaim but she shuts me up and tells me that I was caught cheating. The students around me all interject telling her that I wasn't cheating as they were all witness to what happened. But it didn't matter... I had it with this fucking dumbass teacher so I gave her the finger and walked out of the class. I just couldn't handle another class with her.

So I stopped going. I told the principal what happened and explained that until I was able to re-take the test I wouldn't be going to the class. My parents got involved and it was a whole fucking brou-ha-ha that was caused by my entitled piece of shit teacher. Eventually there was a meeting between the principal, vice principal, my mother, father, the teacher, and I. The teacher didn't say shit. She just sat there with her mouth closed glaring at me hoping the principal would back her up.

She didn't. I re-took the test. Can't remember what I got... I probably failed.

This morning I was actually pleasantly surprised: the flight wasn't very full, so the middle seat was empty, and the lady sitting on the aisle seat was very sweet. 

I had a great chat with the lady, and then our plane headed out to the runway to take off. Just as we're about to go, an announcement is made by the pilot that they're having computer issues so we'll have to go back to the gate. Just my luck.

So we're sitting at the gate as they're fixing the computer issues, and all of a sudden I hear a weird sound. At first I thought it was over the intercom, but then I heard it again. And again. I realized that the man directly behind me was playing a flight simulator game on his phone. Every few seconds the game would tell him a location to land, if an enemy plane was nearby, etc. 

A couple minutes went by and he still hadn't turned the sound off. I started getting pretty pissed. I mean, seriously, USE YOUR HEADPHONES. I turned around and tried to look between the seats, hoping an pissed off look from a fellow passenger would make him realize how annoying that sound was. Nope, he kept on playing. I did that a few more times. Nothing. I even put on my headphones to listen to music, hoping to drown the annoying game out. Nope. It was so loud I could hear it over my music.

I decided I was going to have to take further action. So, I turned to the lady next to me and started striking up a very loud conversation about how annoying it was when people played games or music on their phones without putting on headphones. *""It's just so disruptive and inconsiderate, you know?""* A few people in the seats around us, clearly as annoyed as I was, chimed in, agreeing.

And funny enough, within a few seconds I stopped hearing that annoying sound.

FilmYak,18,31,1p59rh,135,"When I first got out of school, I got a job freelancing as a PA on commercial shoots. A PA -- production assistant -- is the lowest rung on the ladder. It's a shitty job with crappy pay, but you get real-world experience on set. And by commercial shoot, I'm talking 35mm film, full crews, budgets ranging from $50k - $300k per shoot day. This was back in the mid 90's. 

So I get in with this one prodco (production company). They basically get the ad treatment from the agency, and put together a proposal. ""We will shoot it like this, for $x, with this director.""

This one company was a small but successful regional player, and they had lots of jobs, so I tended to work 3-5 days a week for them as a freelancer. I worked my ass off, doing tons of work I loathed, but I did it well and without complaining and they kept hiring me. Meanwhile, I was learning first hand about film shoots. 

The woman who hired me -- I don't remember her name, let's call her PC, because she was the production coordinator. She was a decent boss, no issues, and she liked my work so I was steadily employed. 

Until one day, something happened on set. I didn't do it, but I was there and I immediately fixed the problem. Not a big deal, but it ruined a single take as they were shooting when it happened.  Even though I had fixed the issue and not caused it, I was blamed for it by the director. He said I was a pain-in-the-ass overall because I was always around and trying to see what was going on.  Which is true, but I also stayed out of the way. 

Anyway, he told PC to stop hiring me based on the incident, and she said she would talk to him when I explained my side of the story. She never did, and my work dried up immediately.  Every time I called, she said she hadn't talked to him but would soon. In reality, she was done with me. 

Luckily, I got in with another director, who worked for the largest prodco in the city. I had interned for the prodco before my days as a PA, and they liked me, so now I was their pa. Director saw I was always hanging around and, instead of being pissed, took me under his wing. 

And then the head of the prodco left the company, and  the guy I used to intern for was promoted to head of the company.  He offered to train me to learn his previous job. That was a huge promotion, but he saw my potential and hard work and wanted to take a chance on me. Now it was suddenly my responsibility to bid on jobs, figure the budget, sell the company.... It was a massive learning opportunity and I stayed with them for three full years. 

Well guess what? About 6 months before I left, PC ended up getting a job there as a sales rep. She had to come to me to run budgets. That was my job, so I never screwed her over, but I was plain rude to her for the entire time. She told me I used to be much nicer. I replied that I was still nice to everyone else who didn't drop me for no good reason. 

I was rude to her until the day I left the company. Haven't seen her since.  And I'm still friends -- almost 20 years later -- with the director there, and the guy who hired me to take over his old job.

Rhode,194,527,1p4ck2,1173,"So my boss is a total bitch to me.  She's a bitch to everyone, but she gives it to me double because I'm the only man in the department and she hates men.  She's also married to my stepmother's brother, and she and my stepmother no longer get along so, as they say, shit rolls down hill.  

The revenge is a two-parter.  My boss is a classic middle-management narcissist.  She has this thing where she thinks that other people actually give a shit how much time she spends in the office, which couldn't be further from the truth.  So she puts in a 60 hour week virtually every week thinking that people see her as this great martyr that's making huge sacrifices for the good of the company.  In reality, we all know that her marriage is horribly broken and she is just desperate for attention and validation.  But nonetheless, it absolutely kills her if she's ever not the first person in the office each morning.  So I come in early.  

It makes sense for me to come in early.  We're in Chicago, traffic is brutal here, I like to get a head start.  So I'm here at 7:00 AM every day, and about once a week I'm here by about 6:30, just to stick it to her.  To compensate for me being here early, she's now here at 6:20 most days, which is madness because her drive is at least 45 minutes even without traffic.  Then she stays here past 6:00 PM to miss the evening rush hour, while I leave at 3:30.  Like I said, it's just madness, the work we do here is not important at all.  

The second part of my revenge is great because I've been doing it forever and she's only just now starting to figure it out.  The first thing I do every day is run a report, the details of the report aren't important for this story.   I log in to our system, generate this report, export it to excel, clean up the formatting, and then send it out to the department.  The whole thing only takes about 15 minutes, but my idiot boss thinks it takes longer.  Not only that, but she actually thinks she's helping to do it. 

When she was trained on the system and they showed her how to run this report, they taught her to set a bunch of filters to reduce the size of the report.  I figured out right away that the filters just slow everything down and make the system run slow.  So what my boss does is she runs the report on the system with all the filters in place and it takes forever, like 15-20 minutes, and then she saves it on a shared drive thinking that I then take her file and run with it from there.  But in reality, I just run the whole thing myself and never touch her file.  Running the report without the filters takes only seconds, so it's so much easier to just do it that way and then remove the stuff you don't want once you're in excel.  By the time she gets done running it on the system, I've already got it in excel and I'm almost finished with it.  But every day, without fail, she's been dutifully saving this report for me on the shared drive, and once saved, that file never gets opened again.  

This has been going on for years and she has no idea.  Recently, however, she's had a couple of early morning conference calls and has been late getting the file on to the shared drive.  I didn't know that, though, because I don't ever bother to even look for it.  When she realized that I had completed the report without her assistance, she actually got mad at me!  You've got to understand, this woman has a bonafide personality disorder, she needs constant validation.  That I could do something without her help diminishes her value, and therefore makes her mad.  It was like she didn't even know that I could run the reports on my own.  So she came over to me in rage and told me she wasn't going to run the report anymore and that I'm just wasting her time.  I played innocent and used my boyish charm(I always do, she's clueless), ""Oh gosh! I'm sorry, Sandie!"" I took her abuse while laughing at her on the inside.  It's been a few days now, she hasn't quit running the report for me.  Every day that file has still showed up on the shared drive, she genuinely thinks she's doing important work.  It's great.

TL;DR: Asshole boss wastes her time every day generating a file no one ever touches.  ","Be a complete bitch to me for no reason? That's cool, here let's just waste a bunch of your time first thing in the morning, every day for the rest of the time I work here.",1700

He then tries to fit his charger in the top outlet but it won't fit in the way he wants it to. So what does he do? Unplugs my laptop without so much as an ""Excuse me, is it possible that you could plug your charger into the other socket?"". Of course, this shuts off my laptop. I then tell him that he shut off my laptop and he says ""Oh no, it's okay, I pluged it back in"" I let him know that my laptop literally has no battery ajdnturn it towards him to let him know he caused it to shut off. Besides the fact that he went and touched my stuff. Not an apology or anything. He then turns to his wife and starts complaining in Spanish about me.

I go to a stem magnet school with difficult classes, so getting through homework before one or two in the morning is a struggle. 

My lab partner does not play any sport or do any extra-curricular activities. He gets home several hours earlier than me every day and does not have a race to attend every weekend. I was unable to get started on the lab until the day it was due because of all of my other obligations, but somehow he was able to get a grand total of one paragraph done with the extra four hours he had at home every day. No biggie, he's probably really good at physics and doesn't need that much time to do his fair share of work.

We agreed at school to start when we got home, and I told him that I would be home late, around 8:30. When I got home at 8:45, I rushed onto the Google Document, expecting to see a half completed lab and ready to apologize profusely for my lateness. I saw the same (shitty) paragraph that he had written there, with a little orange cursor sitting at the end doing nothing.

The rest of that night, I worked on that fucking lab. Made diagrams in the Google documents image editor, typed and formatted all of the data and equations, and wrote every damn word of the lab. When I was almost done, he finally came around and gave me the excuse ""I have a test tomorrow for Chinese and lots of APUSH HW."" I had the same History due with the lab, and had not done any of it to work on the Physics lab because he was doing really poorly in Physics and I wanted a nice A to help both our grades. I shot back a passive-aggressive response: ""I haven't started the essay either. Probably not going to sleep tonight"" and he said something about getting sleep for his Chinese test and left the doc.

I was fucking pissed now. He had contributed nothing to the lab report and basically fucked me over in two classes. So I decided to make my name on the title page 22 point font and his name 20 point font. I also put in page numbers in the headers and footers, but I neglected to put his name in any of them.

craightonmiller,17,51,1p3fm0,204,"**The Setting**

My college campus in a pretty small lecture room of about 30 students.


**The Setup**

When in college I took a higher 300-level english class to fulfill some requirement for the university. As by the first week you could tell the students who were there to learn and those students who *had* to take the class.

Some of these students who *had* to take this class, found themselves in a little group and would usually gab away and not pay attention while teaching the class. It was quite obvious too that they did not buy the mandatory book for the class, that we used every day we had the class.

Now this book wasn't expensive at all for about ~$40 you could pick up the book new and sell it back at the end of the year, which out teacher told us. And to be quite honest for the amount of time that we used the book and how we had to reference it while doing a couple papers, the money was well worth it.


Now, as we did in this class almost every day, we read some passages from the book to help familiarize ourselves with different styles and to pick up on some key things that just reading the text in our head, we wouldn't get.

For this, the teacher usually called on students to read some passages and when one of the students who quite honestly didn't belong in the class said they didn't have the book, the teacher just skipped over them.

Until one day.


**The Revenge**

For being obnoxious and loud during the class time, me and a couple friends in the class would position ourselves to sit next to this group and the next time they were called on and *claimed they didn't have their book*. The closest one of us to them would say that they could use our book. The teacher quite obviously thought that was a wonderful idea and forced them to read since someone offered up their book.

For the entire semester someone would always offer up their book to one of them when it came time to read and they always gave us the nastiest looks and stares as we happily gave them our books.",Didn't bring a book? Here use mine.,255
Bozzaholic,5,20,1p34vg,60,"I used to work in a bowling alley as a lane host. It basically meant I hosted parties and served drinks to people on the lanes (it meant they didn't have to go to the bar to get beer).

One day the barman (a couple of years younger than me) decided to give me a [""Grandad""](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=grandad) (term 1) - It was a common thing for him to do to young staff, he thought it was hilarious. He laughed as I limped off with a tray full of drinks to give to some customers.

10 minutes later I'm cleaning up some glasses when I notice that he has gone to take an order in to the kitchen (The bowling alley I worked in sucked, there was printer in the kitchen for food orders)

and thats when I put my plan in to action...

I raced behind the bar and loosened all of the nozzles to the coke dispenser (but left them just resting so it didn't look any different) and I then poured about half a bottle of washing up liquid (dish soap) in to his glass washer. I then left and hovered by the tables waiting for the pay off.

First he comes back from the kitchen and starts watching TV (the bar was quite quiet) but 5 minutes later this huge guy came up to the bar and asked for a coke. As the barman pressed the button for coke the liquid hit the nozzle which dropped off and the coke started spraying everywhere. he then managed to stop it (it still covered his trousers) re-attach the nozzle and pour the drink. He then cleared some table and put on the glass washer

30 seconds later the glass washer was spewing foam bubbles through the cracks in the door, there were bubbles pouring from the glass washer. The barman paniced and switched off the glass washer, he then opened the door (and this bit I wasn't expecting but it was the cherry on top), picked up the tray of glasses and because the tray was so soapy it slipped out of his hand and hit the floor with a HUGE crash (about 20 pint glasses smashed) - There was a huge cheer from everyone in the bar (customary in english pubs/bars) and the barman was left very red faced.

His motivation technique is simple is all based off threats (do this or get a strike). He's in charge of scheduling, every time you ask for a day off, he'll forget and still schedule you. There's many other reasons why, but on to the story:

I currently work as a traveling salesman type position. I ""sell"" a product, except not door to door, and it's free, so it's easy to sell. We have daily quotas that were supposed to meet, which I always exceed. Every 2 hours of my shift, I'm supposed to send my boss a text as to how many sales I've made so far. On occasion, this boss will send me ""reminder"" texts dripping with passive aggressiveness (""I don't have time to tell you how to do your job"", all because I was late with the update). This update is basically there to make sure you're actually getting sales, so it's not that imperative it be sent on the dot. But they like to record it anyway. 

The revenge: I've been working with this company for a while now, the coordinator knows I always bring in good numbers and I've never missed an update. So I'll send it in late.

About 30 seconds later it started... she decided it was a good time to start adjusting her chair by slamming it all the way backwards.  Waits another minute or two, then jerks it forward again.

**Appetizer:** I currently work for a smaller, family owned company. Alongside general cabinet making and contract work, we're also responsible for deliveries. As it just so happened, today I got the short straw and was ordered to do a downtown delivery accompanied by the driver (who is also a worker, but knows the truck so well he's always responsible for driving it) and the old (and I mean old both ways) family/boss' friend whom I've ever seen twice.    
    
**Entree:** As soon as the fellow worker and I began loading the vehicle, that's when the trouble started. Old Grouch (OG from now on) started screaming and bickering about how it's loaded incorrectly, just generally nit picking at absolutely everything. He wasn't happy with the way one of our stand supports was screwed in, so he ordered my coworker (from now on CW) to undo it. We didn't have a screwdriver at the time, so CW asked me to go and get one, and as I jump off the truck and make about 20 feet from it, I think I heard my name get called. I turn around, and OG immediately barks and me to walk faster and to hurry up. Apparently my default pace wasn't satisfactory.

Here's where things get odd. When we were in the truck, OG seemed nice enough. He was talking to CW the whole time reminiscing about his younger days, his vacation, and this and that. Not a big deal, as I was perfectly complacent sitting there in the middle just sponging in their conversation as I didn't really have anything to contribute. We arrive at the destination, jump out of the truck, fling the back open, and begin pulling stuff off the back of the truck. OG starts just digging into me about moving too slowly, or not doing this or that properly, spending too much time twiddling my thumbs (when I was waiting for CW to get to the other side of a larger item to so we can two-man it down), and generally just being a massive nuisance.

I could literally rant until this 10000 character cap hit limit about all the little derogatory comments, but alas, onto the pettiness...

**Dessert:** As we pop out of the truck and make our approach to the final destination (this one was a quick pick up before we headed back to the shop), I noticed that OG's right pant leg was caught on his sock about midway up his calf. OG, for whatever reason, was wearing these really awful patterned old man socks that I'll leave your imagination to recreate. The best thing about the final destination was that it held the big cheese of the yard (would require a whole ton of explanation to make sense), and all of his subordinates.

You know who sleeps till 7.  You know who's unemployed and is home 100% of the time.  You know who needs the paper thrown louder, you know the ones that don't want it thrown at all.  Hell, you even know the ones that want the paper separated into sections and slid under the door.)

""Ma'am, I have always placed them at your door so that it makes a sound.  I do it the same way for you every day.  Perhaps you just didn't hear the noises.  Perhaps you were in another room at the time.""

She was starting to sound more terse - clearly this woman is trying for a fight. ""Ooooooooooh no.  *I sit here every day with my coffee at 5:30* waiting for you to come.  And *you never made the noise.*""

""Ma'am, I did make the noise.  I do it for you the same way every day. And besides, if you don't hear the noise, you can just check to see if it's there.  It will be there before 6 am guaranteed.""

""**But I need to hear it loudly!  That's your job!  I pay for my papers, you are supposed to deliver them so I can hear them!!!**""

(Ok, at this point I have exhausted all reasonable suggestions and have concluded that this tale is clearly more bullshit from a nut-job that just wants to hassle me.  At this point, I figured I had walked her down the path of reason far enough, and I was ready to let her step in the shit.)

""Are you sure?  I can make it extra loud so you'll be sure hear it.""

""Yes.  make it loud so I can hear it.""

I knew what I was going to do.  I thought to myself ""thank goodness tomorrow is Saturday"".  I collected her dues, thanked her and smiled.

I arrived extra early the next morning to deliver the Saturday papers.  4 times the thickness and 4 times the weight of a daily.

I delivered every paper in the complex before hers and saved it for last.  I imagined her sitting there in her nightie at her kitchen table, ass cheeks clenched, her bony knuckles grasping the 5:30 am cup of coffee waiting for the paper to come and make the noise.

Well, it was about to make a noise.

I dropped the final paper, hers, into the bottom of the contractor's trash bag that I had taken from my father's garage.

I had formed what was effectively [an Olympic hammer toss](http://www.freewebs.com/talenter/46816_full-lnd.jpg) device and began to build up momentum.

I dragged the bag behind me as I took 1, 2, 3 steps and twisted my body and arms violently and launched, with as much follow-through as I could muster, the newspaper hammer toss at the base of her door.

###BOOOOOOOM###

I though the door was going to blow off it's hinges.

The shock wave echoed down the painted cinder-block corridors, rattling the light sconces.  The force of the blast caused her heavy door knocker to fly up and come pounding down against the strike plate over and over due to the reverberations.

The echo went on and on for at least 10 seconds.  Maybe more, but I wasn't sticking around to find out.

I took the paper out of the contractor bag, dropped it at the base of her door and headed for the hills.

She switched to automatic billing the next week so I would never collect dues from her in person again.  I knew exactly why.","I'm not delivering your newspapers loud enough? Fair enough, I can fix that.",1349

The particular day I was working we were packed. We had some really sick people that day. Halfway through the shift I get moved up to Triage to help sort people.

Turns out there was a somewhat unpleasant woman who had been waiting for approx 4 hours in the waiting room with back pain that she had been suffering from since a bus accident *6 months ago.* So of course we had plenty of people with chest pain, high fevers, and other such symptoms that immediately pass her up.

She did not appreciate this, and she let us know constantly. Exact qoute; 'If I have to say anything else I am gonna snap the fuck out.'

then the owner comes in, offering his help. I wasn't told to separate them, just pick out the gold ones and fill the order. so the owner asks ""where are you putting all the silver ones?"" I gestured to a box and said I wasn't sure if I should have separated them but I did just in case. he says ""ok that's great because eventually they will need to be separated""

so I made a plan, each day, during the first hour of the work day, I would work on separating these 10000 pieces we have in stock. just an hour when I am not doing anything else and have time to get this out of the way, should only take 3 hours max so that's like 22$ to pay me for doing that, which only took an hour a day for 3 days. 

so last thursday, I am nearly finished, owner walks in and says ""hey, what are you doing?"" 

to which I reply ""separating these wood screws in my downtime so we won't have to later""

he says ""I didn't tell you we needed those separate, they are going to a customer who doesn't need them separate"" (he never told me this, only that they would be going into stock and they would 'eventually' need to be separated and counted)

I told him what my thought process was on the matter and how I know he actually did tell me they needed to be separate and I wasn't wasting his nor my time by separating them. so he goes off on a tangent talking about how he's paying me $150 a day to count screws that cost pennies and I am wasting his time and that i'm a liar and how he 'has the memory of a hawk' and if I tell him that he said they needed to be separated then I am a stone cold liar.

well I simply won't put up with this shit, I know exactly what he said and where he was when he said it.

My thought was that at least there were 3 dryers so I wouldn't have to deal with him doing the same thing with the dryers. I should mention my apartment is directly next to the laundry. So when it was time to move my clothes from the washer to the dryer I went over and this shit bag had divided up his clothes to take all 3 dryers! Wtf? So I waited. And I waited.

tldr; Be careful dating librarians, they can run up fees on your account and not let you graduate.

I have an equally irritating grandmother, and she is part of my least favorite social groups out there: the martyrs. If she does any kind of community service she'll use it to boost her image to other people, and if she has a problem she bitches incessantly. One of her problems is how much she hates my dog. She refuses to do anything that involves him, even if it's as simple as opening two doors to let him outside. 

I'm still in high school so I leave every morning at seven thirty after letting my dog run around in the backyard, put him in his kennel, and come home at four. It isn't ideal, but he gets lots of love and cookies when I get home. Grandma never lets him out of his kennel while I'm away, despite the fact that she lives in our house and stays home all day. 

Today, as it goes every week, I walked in to my house and saw my grandma talking on the phone, sitting on the couch with her feet kicked up. The scent of shit in the air was the other prominent feature of the room. After letting Jackaboo out, giving him water and letting him run around while I cleaned smashed shit out of the bottom of the kennel I walked my other dog and went up to my room to internet. Today this consisted of me watching youtube videos (Troye Sivan is amazing) and after half an hour or so guess who walked in saying the internet didn't work? My response was, ""Bummer. Try turning it on and off?"" and then looking back at my screen and streaming all the internet away. No hallmark movies for you, dog-hater.

DerpingLegitly,1,16,1oxjaw,27,"I've been lurking around here awhile, and I decided to post another story.

**The BACKGROUND**
When I was a high school freshman, I was just like any old run-of-the-mill student. I played sports, had friends, went out, cool. But as you can see, I was also a nerd at heart. Straight A's, shitty fashion sense (as in trying to keep up with the ""hip"" trends of the days.) Enter MFB, or motherfucking bitch. She was an all around bundle of sticks. And, she continuously harassed the geeks at our school, just for playing Pokèmon and Yu-Gi-Oh and whatever that was. They'd meet up in the library, and out of the watchful eye of the librarian, she'd make fun of them, being an absolute disgrace, just for doing their hobby.

**Her And Me**
So MFB finally finished her rounds of people to insult. What she forgot was me, and I was the last one on her goddamn list. MFB gossiped about me to her friends one day, and somehow, the next few days, the story was that I ""sucked dick for a living"" and ""should die cuz I'm Asian"". Well, first of all, that's not nice, and second of all, just because we're Asian, doesn't mean we are just beta like that (Filipinos are known to be kind, kinder than the Canadians, and doing a favor will ensue a niceness battle w/ each other.).

**The Revenge**
I went up to my Latin teacher to help me out. He was a true boss and looked like a lumber jack with thick long hair and a beautiful and majestic beard. And this is coming from a guy! So I told this guy about this MFB and he told me he'll take care of it, as MFB and I had the same mods together. 

Later that day, it's the final mod, Latin. We take our seats and begin learning about conjugations and derivatives. Then, when the word *derogatory* came up, he immediately used MFB as an example, stating that, IIRC: ""MFB, it is not nice to gossip derogatory remarks against DerpingLegitly."" She went from her normal color of Spray-On Tan Orange to Ratchet-Ass Red. Again, ALT (Awesome Latin Teacher) blasted her with the forces of Latin derived words, and using MFB as an example in *every one of them.* When she looked down at her cellphone in embarrassment, seeing that it was the truth, ALT took away her phone, remarking, ""Off and away during the day."" (A school policy on phones.). Bang bang! Shots fired! Two direct hits to her ego!

...

Class ended, and I walked out the classroom with the snarkiest face I could muster and looked at her. I subtly thumbs-up'd the ALT, and headed to our school buses.

TL;DR: Your mom.

My other roommates and I get really tired of having to clean them all up then wash his snot off of our hands on a regular basis. It's disgusting.

He also refuses to use any tissues other than Puffs Plus. Since I always go to the store to restock, I have been told many times to ensure that I buy the correct brand, and not, God forbid, Kleenex brand. They are unacceptable.

Since I'm tired of picking up after him every day, I started piling all of the tissues that didn't make it in the trash on his desk. He ignored them and started using my desk instead. So, I upped the revenge factor: last time I went to the store, I bought a box of Puffs Plus and a box of Kleenex, opened the side of the Puffs box, slid the Kleenex in and threw the Puffs away. Now I have a box of Kleenex tissues inside of a factory-sealed Puffs box. At the bottom of the box, I put the Kleenex logo so that he would be sure to see it when he used the last tissue.

I decided I needed to make a change.  Today I was coming into the building and was being pursued by a lackadaisical woman chatting busily on her phone.  I held the door open for her as per usual but she did not say anything.  In fact, she seemed completely out of touch.

I was still in need to see a doctor because of reasons, but because I felt better after that two week period and therefore I ignored I didn't feel a need to go to book an appointment and carried on with my everyday life.

jallak,33,51,1owfkd,40,"I live in an old house (late 1800s) that was converted to apartments. 4 units total, we all know each other and there's a nice sense of comradery and friendship.

My landlord bought the building about four or five years ago. Previously it was owned by a woman who didn't really give a shit, and it was awesome. If something was broken, it got fixed. Otherwise, as long as you paid the rent within a week or two of when it was due, everything was cool. Then this guy buys it, who also owns about 40% of the rental properties in town. He has his own 'property management' company and a legion of Brazilian men who work for him (probably for pretty cheap).

Within a few months of purchasing the building, he starts working on it. I understand, I would do the same thing. But the thing is he is an *awful* landlord. He's a great guy, but he doesn't know shit about land-lording. He does things without telling *anyone*, just one day people show up and start working. Sometimes I work nights, and it's nice to sleep in. To put it in perspective, I have two people in my life who work for different property management companies. With the exception of an emergency (tree falling, hazardous conditions, etc) the tenants get a **minimum** of one week's notice when something is going to be performed to the property, two weeks if possible.

He previously owned the building next to mine and when he purchased mine, he decided to completely remove the back yards of both houses (which were awesome; picnic table, clothes line, area for kids to play [not that there are any kids, but still], etc). So I come home from work one day, and my backyard is gone. Completely gone, no grass, no picnic table, nothing. Leveled dirt. It looks like shit. I was not told before hand. So now we have a giant dirt parking lot, which is nice, but the yard was much nicer and there's street parking everywhere for everyone.

A few months later, he decides to build another apartment in the attic. For months his minions were here at 7am sharp hammering, nailing, cutting, drilling, going up and down the stairs in work boots while yelling/talking, carrying wood and tools, and blaring the radio. Legally it's not disturbing the peace. It's just plain rude.

There was no warning, no letter, no email, no phone call that there will be 4 months of building-shaking construction. It just happened. Then it stopped.

The construction one day just stopped. I went up there and poked around, as the door was unlocked, and they had torn up all the walls, back boards, ceilings and floors. They had finished framing it, and left it without any floor or sheetrock. It stayed that way for over a year.

A year later, it started again. Within two months (again, loud and rude with *zero* warning ahead of time) it was finished and a week later, people moved in. These people kind of suck and are loud  and generally rude when it comes to noise. No one in the building likes them. The guy has a motorcycle you can hear from a half mile away that he loves to take to work at 5am in the warm weather.

We're about a year in after that, and the driveway JUST got paved a couple of weeks ago. It went three years or so unpaved so in the winter, it was pretty unplowable. You would get stuck in the snow and end up digging a pothole, which of course turned the driveway to an uneven shit show for three years.

There have been many other smaller things throughout the years. Like I said, great guy, awful landlord.

So for the past three years, whenever he's rude or disruptive without warning, I leave my sink on for a day or two.  In the summer I'll leave the hose spigot open a little. Sure, it wastes water, but in my state the law says the landlord must pay the water bill.

This morning I woke up God knows when but I know it was too early so I rolled over and went back to sleep. I dunno if it was two hours later, or one, or even five minutes, but I was woken up shortly after by a huge bang outside. In what felt like a drunken state (or I imagine feels like it) I opened my window to a truck bed parked outside the house next door where they're throwing bricks on a truck or something like that, since they're renovating the house or store next door I guess.

The thrift store I worked for occasionally had fundraisers to help better the store because they gave most of their funds to local charities. Unfortunately, most of the customers did not know about the donations (even though we had signs everywhere stating our mission statement) so I got used to the ""why should I donate? I'm already giving you my money by shopping?"" Most customers calmed down after I stated what the funds were going to and why we even needed a fundraiser. There was one woman though who was the epitome of why everyone hates retail.

She was an older woman who looked like she was constantly smelling something awful. Her purchases were small cheap items totaling around $7 but she decided that that was too much money to spend at a thrift store. She went on and on about how we are ""robbing her blind"" and that she should just go shop at target for new items instead of paying for these expensive used items. Any question I asked her (did you find everything ok, would you like paper or plastic, how are you, etc) seemed to offend her in the worst way possible. By the end of the transaction I was so fed up with her I was moments away from screaming at her. I wasn't going to bother asking her for a donation but then I had an idea. I decided to secretly put a $1 donation on her total. It wasn't much and even though she was complaining about how expensive things are, she definitely had money.

No biggie, that happens all the time if people leave their stuff inside after the cycle has finished. But when I got up to my room, the stuff was still wet! Someone had taken it out before it was dry to put their own stuff in. I was going to play lacrosse so I had to play in wet clothes. Not nice, but not anything I can't deal with. Normally I'd just forget about it and move on, but then I had an idea. So on the way to lacrosse I went back down, took their stuff out the tumble dryer and left this note.

diatomic,154,285,1ou0cz,943,"Let's start by saying that I make a pretty scrumptious carrot cake. I spent a few months tweaking recipes I found online until I felt I had unlocked maximum deliciousness. I bake quite a bit, but the carrot cake is sort of my specialty and I sell it to a couple of local restaurants every so often. My coworkers, especially my boss, are crazy for it.

I work in a small private language academy. My boss is a bit of a psychotic control-freak and one day, in a move to enact some petty revenge of her own, she locked the door to the copy room and hid the key in her office. This was to punish all the teachers for leaving the door open between classes, which I guess bothers her because she is afraid students will go inside the staff room and mess with the photocopier and/or other things we use for class. Never mind that this childish behaviour affects the students more than us by depriving them of class materials. I wasn't going to lose any sleep if they didn't get their wordsearch copied, but it was the principle of the thing.

So my boss has been pestering me for a long time to give her my recipe so she can make carrot cake at home. Up until now I'd just been procrastinating, but after this incident I typed it up nicely and emailed it to her. I just accidentally forgot to include the key ingredients that make it especially moist and tasty. 


**Hey everyone! Thanks for the awesome feedback. R/pettyrevenge is my favorite subreddit and you all inspire me! I'm trying to keep up with all the requests for the recipe, but if you wrote me a comment and I didn't get back to you, send me a PM.

Gaggamaggot,23,23,1otj4g,79,"I live &amp; work in a modest college town in Texas (gig 'em!) where we tend to get an influx of ""stunt drivers"" here this time every year - kids who think Grand Theft Auto taught them everything they will ever need to know about driving. Toss in the nincompoops who think speed limits are merely a suggestion and you get a lot of avoidable accidents, and I've seen a few. A lot of them are fatal.

Today I was driving my big old F-350 down the two-lane highway at the legal speed limit, which is 75 mph - more than enough for most drivers. I see an SUV dive over from the fast lane at the last second to catch an off-ramp he almost missed, narrowly missing a Honda that was tearing around me doing about 90. I shake my head, then in my rear-view see a Toyota ripping through traffic moving even faster than the Honda. 

He gets to my bumper and whips to the right lane to fly around me at a relatively low altitude, then has to jump on his brakes to avoid rear-ending a motorcycle who was doing about 72. As a former rider that kinda ticked  me off. Then he jumps over behind me again, riding my bumper and clearly going to follow me around the Harley then pass us both. 

Ahead of the Harley about 100 yards is one of those bus-sized motor homes towing a Jeep, doing the legal limit for a behemoth that size - about 60 - WAY too slow for Speedy Gonzales. Speedy wants to pass the Harley, then the coach, and hurry down the road. 

Nuh-uh.

My truck has an engine about the size of a hippo under the hood. As I pass the Harley I gently press the gas and speed up as Speedy pulls over to pass me. Not a chance. I easily cut him off and pull up next to the oh-so-slow coach. Speedy is pissed, but pulls in behind me, figuring he'll pass the coach and THEN get his chance to pass me. 

I eased up off the gas and settled in next to the coach.

At 60 miles per hour. 

The look on Speedy's face was priceless. I got the ""come on already"" hand flip. Then he started comparing my driving to a lowly body part. (I read lips sort of okay, but he was making it real easy). He said something about what he believed I do with mothers. 

A mile goes by. I passed my exit, still next to the coach. Smiled &amp; waved at the coach driver, who was watching it all in his side mirror with a grin. Speedy pulled out his phone and started yelling at it. 

Another slow mile later I finally sped up because I had to take the next exit to get to work, and felt I had made my point. As Speedy accelerated to pass me I also sped up to keep him from passing and waved good-bye to his angry, angry face before taking the exit.

I used to get annoyed by the shaking too that I used to do it when I'm not at home, the two speakers were so loud that I was afraid that my other neighbors would be annoyed. But luckily, the apartment had two ceilings with the Central AC inbetween (I glued the speakers to the second ceiling).

Iavasloke,16,32,1oqp68,105,"A couple years ago, my mom and I were living in a big house in the rural Southwest desert. We were in a rough spot financially, so we invited one of my mom's co-workers and her 14-year-old daughter to live with us (they also needed a fiscal break). 

Our new roommate Billie had moved to the desert from a big city up north: she thought our culture &amp; area were ""backward,"" and would openly laugh at things we did every day. She loved to brag about her hometown, and she had cheesy nick-knacks and memorabilia from that city all over the place. Her favorite was a jumbo coffee mug she drank out of every day, which featured an aerial photo of the city and its' name emblazoned in pretty blue letters on the handle.

Billie was a nightmare roommate and just a terrible person overall. Her daughter was an obnoxious Twilight devotee who blasted Beiber from her room at all hours. Billie never cooked, cleaned, or took care of her dogs. I ended up picking up the slack, which I might not have minded if Billie had ever thought to say thank you. She was just inconsiderate and obnoxious.

She also made a regular habit of destroying our things. I don't know if she was just a klutz, or had some honest-to-God inability to think, but she put holes in the walls, ignored common rules for septic systems, stained the carpets, let her dogs run rampant across the property, and never lifted a finger. Well, one day she broke a measuring cup that meant a lot to my mom. My mom had gotten this cup in the 1970's as one of her first purchases for her [hope chest.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_chest) I adore my mom, and she is usually a zen master, so seeing her upset by this broken cup was infuriating.

So the next time I did Billie's dishes, I dropped some of her cups onto the stainless steel, and took her favorite coffee mug and put it in my dresser. I apologized and told her I'd had a sudden bout of contractions and lost my balance carrying a load back to cabinet (I was preggo), accidentally breaking her dishes. She was really sad when I told her that her favorite cup had fallen right off my tray and exploded into powder when it hit the tile. But the dumb bitch bought it, and now that mug is MY favorite! *muwahahahaha!*

I had more diabolical plans, but my mother is a saint and would not let me put a dead mouse in Billie's bathtub. What a waste of a perfectly good mouse corpse!

**Story one:**

Back when Black Ops was the newest game, I loved it. I played on my roommate's Xbox since the PC port was terrible.

If you're not aware, you can design your own ""emblem"" with different shapes and other can see them. There was a problem with some people, though. Some thought it was funny to make swatzikas or racist emblems. I didn't like this.

I went scouring through games looking for people with racist or nazi emblems. After reporting them, I joined their team. I then would follow them around and wait until the opportunity arose.

In BLOPS, you can trap people in corners and they cannot push you out. ([See here for hilarious examples.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biEehUghoK0)) You can either kill yourself with a grenade, or quit. If they killed themselves, I would just find them again. If they quit, I would look up their gamertag and follow them to other games and do the same thing. It was satisfying.

**Story two:**

For the past two years, I've been playing Battlefield 3 on my bitchin' PC. I love everything about the game, from the crazy experiences to the amazing gameplay. But again, some people were not so great.

I recall people teamkilling me because ""I was looking at them"" and because I accidentally teamkill them so they follow me throughout the game and kill me in return. If they did this, or were just being rude/racist, they go on ""The List.""

Anyone that does these things gets bookmarked by me. Anytime I'm feeling bad, I go through these lists, find who's online, and join their team. Unfortunately, I cannot trap people in corners. Instead, I join their squad, follow around, and shoot smoke grenades in front of them for the entire game. They get mad easily.

MHC-II,72,219,1oq671,824,"I worked in the service department at a certified German auto dealership for a year. It was fun job because I got to drive some amazing cars. I was the guy that handled all the money in the service department and took care of the loaner cars. This meant that every customer in the service department got funneled to me. When I wasn't handling clients' cash, I made sure every loaner car was clean and fueled up. It's a simple job, but we're constantly busy. I was able to keep up with the work and keep customers happy, so the manager was always happy to have my back when I needed him.

We had some pretty cool customers. For example, we had a guy with a Carrera GT invite us onto his yacht to watch the 4th of July fireworks. We also had a nice little lady that brought in a plate of ""better than sex"" cake for us every time she visited (this cake really was better than sex). The vast majority of our clients were pleasant, but I've had my fair share of difficult customers as well.

Other than getting to drive 911's and M3's all day, the best part of my job was the petty revenge I got to dish out on the difficult customers. Normally, the car I loaned you depended on the car you brought in (Mercedes gets a C class, Porsche gets a Panamera, BMW gets a 328i, Audi gets an A4). However, the management gave me discretion to deal with customers that were a pain in the ass. We had a couple of Hondas that we kept around just for the difficult customers. If you gave me shit, I might ""run out of Mercedes"" and give you a Honda Accord instead. Hondas are great cars, but there's something about going from German to Japanese that annoys entitled pricks. Of course, it's never my fault that we ""ran out"" of Mercedes, so there's nothing they can do about being stuck with a Japanese car (other than huff and puff about it).

If petty revenge were a competition, I had a winning streak that would have put George Foreman's boxing record to shame. No difficult customer went unpunished. Like George Foreman, however, my winning streak had to come to an end. Our new service writer told me that an out-of-towner hambeast needed a loaner car while we serviced her Mercedes (the new guys always got the new customers so they could build up their clientéle). By out-of-towner, I mean this lady drove two-and-a-half hours north from Irvine to reach us. Kinda strange, but whatever.

Hambeast walks over to my department, where I go over the rental car agreement with her: don't damage the car, no pets, $20 flat fee, etc. When I got to the loaner fee, she flipped her shit. Everybody in proximity turned their heads as she shouted about the $20 fee (Jesus Christ lady. If you can afford a Mercedes, you can certainly afford a $20 rental car). I'm given discretion to waive the loaner fee (if it's a really good customer), but I refuse to give her a free car. She storms off to New Guy and makes him waive her loaner fee.

Whatever. She got her way and didn't have to pay for the car. Hope she enjoys her free Honda... OH. SHIT. We ran out of Hondas, and only had a Mercedes left for her. I had to give her the Mercedes now; there was nothing I could do about it. I knew I was defeated, so I downtroddenly handed her the keys to the C-class loaner car. She snatched the keys from my hand, grabbed her dog out of her car and placed it into the loaner car (NO PETS!!!) and drove off victoriously.

Later in the day, New Guy handed me a pair of loaner keys to check back into the system. They belonged to Hambeast's loaner car. I went over to inspect her loaner car, and found the front seat covered in fur and vomit (I'm only 90% sure it was the dog's fault). Hambeast was nowhere to be found. New Guy ringed her out while I was busy with other customers, and gave her back her own car. This was a huge no-no because I have to check the rental cars for damages before giving the customer back their own car. Hambeast circumvented the loaner car inspection, got her own car back, and escaped before I could discover the dog vomit.

As soon as I told my manager what just happened (and have him ask me why the hell I didn't give her the Honda), he picked up the phone and called her. He demanded she come back to the dealership and pay to get the car cleaned; she refused. You can fuck with the employees all day, but never, EVER fuck with the manager. He banned her from the dealership on the spot. When she heard this, she shrieked in a fit of rage and hung up on us.

Remember how she lived 2.5 hours away from us? Well, we called the dealership in Irvine and asked if they knew about her. They laughed, and told us she was banned from their dealership. They told us that she moved on to the next closest dealership. When they got sick of her shit, she got banned and had to get serviced at the next dealership. Then the next one. Then the next one. She pissed off so many dealerships that she had to drive 2.5 hours north (or jump the border to Mexico) to get to a dealership she wasn't banned from.

Unfortunately for her, the next closest dealership was a 2.5 hour drive north of us. This was great for our business because we covered a large geographical area. But for Hambeast, that meant that if she needed her car serviced, she would need to take another 2.5 hour drive on top of the 2.5 hours she had to drive from Irvine. Five hours of driving just to get to the northern dealership. Joke's on her, though. We warned the northern dealership about her, and they pre-emptively banned her.

We never heard from Hambeast again. Mercedes customers are fiercely loyal to the brand, so there's no way she would sell the car just so she could get another brand serviced in Irvine. Some say Hambeast is still driving up the coast of California, looking for a dealership that'll put up with her shit. Others say she traveled to Nevada to get her car serviced. Either way, New Guy learned a valuable lesson, and never made that mistake ever again.

I turned to him and said in the most innocent sarcastic voice ""I'm sorry dude, are you ok?"" SK glared at me like he wanted to punch me then and there.

estellecabones,18,13,1oodfv,100,"**Background**

Long story short, my little brother spent the last 4 years being emotionally abusive to my mother and I. He would lie about and manipulate everything to be in his favour. He lived with us rent free, didn't have or look for a job, didn't apply or go to school, didn't help out around the house (but would complain about it all the time), frequently verbally abuse my mom, and basically be a selfish little prick. He slept all day and played video games all night which would keep my mom and I up too. I don't know what he did to my 2 dogs but for whatever reason, they cower, hide, and run away whenever he gets close to them. He eventually picked up a heavy drinking habit because ""[he] was bored"" and landed himself a DUI. That was the last straw and mom finally kicked him out.

**What's going on now and sweet revenge**

Well, all good things must come to an end and he managed to convince my mom to let him stay here for ""5 days""....5 days is now looking like 2 weeks but whatever. I can now get revenge for all the years of shit he put me through.

Beginning with his DUI. He lost his license and has to walk everywhere. He used to go out daily and get fast food, Starbucks, and delicious snacks. He can't do that now because it's all too far away and he has little money. So what did I do? I made my rounds to all his favourite spots and picked up a few things. Veggie burger from Harveys, tea from Starbucks, burrito from that one place, and some McDonalds fries. I generally don't frequent those places but for the sake of revenge, I made an exception. I didn't eat most of the food BUT I kept all the bags/cups. And every so often I run into him in the house while holding one of the bags. Muahahahaha. 

I also happen to have cat food and cat litter in the trunk of my car from when he was gone and I had to watch his cat. The cat wasn't out of food or litter when I bought it so I left it in the trunk. Since he's been back, he's had to walk 40 minutes (40 there, 40 back) to the pet store to pick up cat food. And soon he'll have to make the trip again for litter...and as some of you may know, litter is heavy! I have the food and litter on full display in my car but since I keep both sets of keys on me at all times, he is shit out of luck. 

Same with cigarettes. The gas station is a good 20 minute walk (40 in total) but I also have a carton of smokes in my car. Since he lost his license (and for whatever reason, won't get an ID card), half the time he can't even buy them. 

One last thing: it's pouring rain outside right now. I hope he enjoys the 40 minute walk to work!","Finally, some revenge on my manipulative and abusive brother.",113

No bother, just tune it out again. It gets louder. And closer.

I finally look up to see a middle-aged couple arguing at the tops of their lungs as they approach the bus stop. Hoping they'll keep walking past the stop, I go back to my book. My hopes are dashed as they stop walking, but not arguing. If anything, the volume increases when he refuses to give her a cigarette as he pulls one out for himself. 

Finally, I see the bus pull around the corner, so I stash my book and stand up. At this point, the couple has wandered a few feet away from the stop, neither of them paying attention to the road or the swiftly approaching bus.

Our mother made an awesome lasagna.  It was her own recipe and it never failed to satisfy. 

This tale of revenge starts after the copious consumption of one of said lasagnas. Our mother stated that she wanted to make it healthier and was contemplating the addition of veggies to her dish, mainly spinach.  My brothers and I exploded saying that it would ruin the dish and that we would never touch it with such changes.

Fast forward a few months and she delivered THE best lasagna ever. We devoured that thing.  Left overs did not last more than two days.  Our compliments were long, eloquent, and numerous.  Our mother beamed. We talked about that lasagna for years and years afterward.  None of her casseroles after seemed to measure up, although they were still quite good.

Fast forward 20 years... Yes, 20 years.   

Let me say it again, TWENTY freaking years later.  

We are all sitting around the Thanksgiving dinner table, after a particularly successful feast and we started talking about meals from the past that were on par.  That particular lasagna came up and we all agreed that it was one of the best meals ever.  Our mother started laughing, not just some little chuckle, but the grand daddy of all mirth filled bellows that shook windows and caused bricks to fall from buildings. 

With tears streaming down her cheeks, from the laughter, she looked at our bewildered expressions and stated; ""There was not one single scrap of meat in that lasagna. I replaced it with spinach.""  

It took a long time for the laughter to die down.  As proof, the next day she made the meatless lasagna again and damn was it good.

I'd only been working here for about a month, still in training, mainly busing tables, washing dishes, doing prep etc. Real basic stuff, but management is kind of lazy when it comes to training. They're good people though and treat all the customers and employees like family. It's very close knit.

Up until this point, I hadn't really had any customer interaction though. If the phones were ringing, or I happened to walk by a customer I was just suppose to say hi, or put them on hold, and then get someone else to take care of them. Sure, I wanted to start doing more than just basic noob shit, but at the same time I wasn't going to complain. On a busy Friday/Saturday I'm more than happy to just chill in the back and do some dishes.

Anyways, the other night was my lucky night. I was going to start doing ""food runs"". Basically, people's food comes out, the pizza cutter gives you a ticket with their food, you find their table and serve them their food. Simple right? Of course on my first run I fuck up horribly.
I find the table, it's an older couple, maybe late 50s/early 60s. Now pizza trays are kind of slippery with all the grease under them, so as I go to set it down the pizza starts to slide off the tray and lands on the table. Total noob mistake.

All three of us just kind of stare at the pizza, half sitting on the tray, half sitting on the table. I try to make light of it with a ""Well...this is awkward"" and the guy makes some sarcastic passive aggressive smart-ass comment about it.

I realize they're a little upset, so I apologize. I tell them it's my first time, I totally botched it. If they want I'd be more than happy to have it remade ASAP (so no wait) and have another server bring it out to them to ensure this doesn't happen again, and they aren't further inconvenienced.

This seems to lighten their mood and they seem okay. They smile and say ""Oh no, that's okay! It's a mistake, no big deal! Thank you though!"" Okay great, problem solved.

I head back into the kitchen and my manager asks how it goes. I tell her and she just laughs. Apparently everyone there has fucked up before. One guy (a manager), even knocked a guy's drink on to him. But she appreciated that I took control of the situation and offered to fix it for them, and that I did everything right, and it'll just take me a few more tries to get the hang of it.

A few minutes after finishing our conversation the lady comes over, now furious. She tries to get my manager's attention. ""Ma'am! Ma'am! I have a complaint. Your EMPLOYEE just dropped our pizza and it got all over our table. Then he proceeded to just laugh about it and walk away. That's disgusting and very rude. We're not eating that, and I want it remade.""

My manager responds: ""Well, I'm sorry about that ma'am, and I'll be happy to remake it for you. And I already talked to my employee about it as it was his first time, to see how everything went. From what he told me it was an accident and he offered to remake it but you guys said it was okay.""

She responds: ""No that's not what happened. He just tossed our pizza on to the table. Said ""oops"" and laughed about it and just walked away.""

My manager responds: ""Well I'm very sorry. I was just making sure, because we could have started remaking it minutes ago so you wouldn't have to have been waiting as long. We'll take care of it though.""

Lady walks away and I look at my manager like ""seriously?"" She looks at me and says ""Fuck that bitch. You know what? She can wait.""

Hey, it happens. Sometimes tickets get ""mixed up"". Or people call ahead of time so their's ends up ""taking priority"".

Boo her move out date is 5 days after her planned honeymoon. As luck would have it, U-Haul seemed to be sold out of boxes so I was wandering around town looking for free boxes. 

I went to the liquor store and -YAY- they had a pile of boxes, not flattened, but free boxes are free boxes. The boxes are on a flat and piled up about 7 feet high. Ran outside to move my car so the back was at the front door. I'm not the best at backing up my car so I pulled up to the spot had my blinker on trying to line up.

Then Buddy in his shiny Toyota decides to drive around me and park in my spot so he can run in and grab some beer. GR.

I see Buddy standing in line with his 24 of beer and I give one of those death glares. 

I go to the back of the store to ask if I can borrow the flat to just push all the boxes out to my car. I get the great idea that I should just bring the flat out and leave in front of the Toyota. I make sure to pass by the purchase line and I have everyone's attention. Who doesn't loves watching a girl in a mini-dress doing manual labour?

citking,2,9,1onnt4,40,"A little background: At the university I work for I am responsible for, among other things, purchasing IT equipment for all of the departments I support on my state-issued credit card or through an internal account number (IAN). I then indicate which purchases go onto which department's accounts every couple of weeks and give that to the financial specialist (Betty) to reconcile and transfer. 

The IAN method, which I have to use for contracted vendors, involves a little work to transfer funds between accounts. These accounts are closed three business days after the first Monday of the new month (got that?). Transfers made before the three days after the first Monday of the month can be done relatively easily through a web portal. Transfers after that cutoff period need to be done by Betty, whose sole job pretty much revolves around doing that, expense reports, and day-to-day financials. 

Now Betty is a fairly lazy old lady who should have retired years ago. I understand she is just riding out her time to gain a few more bucks on her pension after retirement. However, she likes to yell at me when I send her late transfers because it takes her 5 minutes to process that transfer as opposed to 45 seconds using the web portal. Being the sole IT support person (tier 1, 2,  and 3) for three different departments housed in a single building I have a lot of work to do so sometimes my purchases don't get reconciled until I have a free moment.

The last straw came last week after I sent her a late transfer. I held onto it because the professor hadn't decided if he liked the laptop enough yet to keep it or send it back. I was doing this to try and save her some work, because if he wanted it sent back then she'd have to do two transfers, once to his account and then one back to me if he wanted to return it. Once he determined he liked it I sent it to Betty to be transferred to his account. Cue her yelling at me, calling me down to her desk, showing me how much work this all is, and reminding me yet again of the third business day after the first Monday of the month deadline. This whole charade took about half an hour, or 550% more time than just doing the effing transfer would have taken her.

She exacted her revenge on me by asking me to give her the ""business purpose that adequately justifies the purchase of the Nexus 7 tablet you bought last week."" This is well within her rights but is petty revenge for sure - she's never asked me to justify IT purchases before. 

So, after giving her and my boss the business justification she needed, I am now holding all pending IAN purchases until the *fourth* business day after the first Monday in the month. I'm also going to tell the professor that I can get him a better laptop for cheaper (which is true) so she'll need to transfer than money back to me and then do another transfer when he purchases the new laptop.

Cupinacup,29,132,1onm5f,697,"I hate parking garages. Sure, they're convenient, but they're often overpriced, have bums, and the people who park in them are awful. Fortunately, the parking garage at my university only suffers from the last of the three problems, so 2 out of 3 isn't bad. I give it a D.

At any rate, I often park on the second to top floor, 5 (or 4th, for you weird Europeans) because a) I can get close to the stairs and elevator, b) I don't have to waste 15 minutes to find a parking space, and c) people on the top floor don't park like Hellen Keller. However, as I am often reminded, that doesn't stop them from being shitty human beings.

Now I usually take the stairs, but this past week I've been taking the elevator mainly because I've been fairly under the weather and don't feel like overexerting myself over something as pointless as getting to the bottom floor faster when the elevator will do just as well (after all, the elevator in this garage is fairly slow). And for the most part, people this week on the top floor have been generally polite. Except for today.

As I get out of my car, I see a couple waiting at the elevator maybe thirty yards away. As I hustle over, I hear the *ding* and the doors slide open.

I was maybe five yards away when the dude gives me a smirk and a little wave of the hand. What an asshole.

There's whiny, and then there's melodramatic, cheap bastards. That's where ""Larry"" comes in. Larry was a pretty cool dude I met at a trade show in Las Vegas. He owns a jewelry factory in Mexico and was extremely excited at the potential this 3D printer has. He went ahead and purchased a printer, and 8 to 10 weeks later, he received it damaged. Somehow either UPS or the Mexican Customs caused some issues with the printer, so I spent the next few days working with Larry over the phone to repair it. The whole time, I put up with his incessant whining and complaining.

At the end of this ordeal I found out he didn't purchase material specifically sold with the printer because he wanted to be cheap and use questionable resin he found in bulk. The approved material he should have bought comes with an RFID sticker that assures that he must only use our material for the printer to work. In essence, no RFID sticker, no printing. I told him this, and he freaked and even threatened to call the Better Business Bureau. He went on and on how important he is and how successful he is and that this shouldn't happen to him... blah, blah, blah. I didn't sell him this printer, so I couldn't blame him if someone told him otherwise, so we sold him a bottle of material (I'll call it castable material A) with the sticker. He then demanded we not send the bottle so customs doesn't hold it indefinitely, and he also demanded the invoice be marked at $10 so he isn't taxed much. He would pick up the bottle next time he's in the states. Three weeks later, he calls me up whining that customs held the trays which is costing him business. I didn't realize this (or the fact that this printer is the answer to all his problems), but he was starting to tick me off.

So Larry finally gets the printer to function properly with the new RFID tag and he called again complaining that he is having trouble with the material. I'm starting to not appreciate this guy anymore. He's hot then he's cold. Nothing can please him unless it's absolutely perfect and I find it hard to believe that Larry, Mr. successful-factory-owner-extraordinaire, has never hit snags like this before. Either that, or he his exaggerating all his problems. I simply told him that he must use our material. I cannot support other materials because the machine is engineered to work with certain viscosities, opacities, and other specific properties of our specific materials. For me to support and troubleshoot knockoff resin over the phone, would be a waste of my time (I still have graphic designing to do). He flipped out again and hung up on me. The only way I could reach out to him is via email. He refuses to give out his phone number so I must email him so he can call our 1-800 number (very cheap). I emailed him (such a waste of time) to explain what I needed to tell him about adjusting the machine's settings to see if he can get his knockoff resin to work.

A week later Larry emails me that he needs urgent help or he will return the machine. I email him immediately saying he can call me, but it must be soon because I will be traveling for business soon. I don't hear back from him for weeks. He of course decided to call me at 5PM just as I was leaving so I can explain how to use the machine. Excuse me???  How long has he had this machine? Such a bastard. I didn't go home til 5:45... No overtime for that because I'm salaried. 

A few weeks after that, he decides to visit the states, so out of the blue he calls my boss asking him to send the castable material he purchased to his hotel room. At this point there is an updated material (castable material B) that builds a little cleaner. He asked me some time ago if he can exchange material A for material B. I was already pissed off enough with him so I told him to make that deal with my boss. I'm in no position to make deals, let alone with this shady prick. Of course my boss sent material A because Larry NEVER asked my boss what I told him. The next day Larry calls screaming that we sent the wrong material. My boss came into my office and screamed at me that I made a deal with Larry and we should have sent material B, not material A. I told him I made no such deal, but it seemed Larry lied to my boss to get what he wants. He even demanded that because we made such a mistake, we should send him a free bottle of material to compensate for the time he lost, which I believe my boss agreed to... Thus making me the bad guy.

When Larry got back to Mexico today, he called me because his RFID reader apparently stopped working (although I think he was tampering with it so he can use is cheap resin). Knowing what the solution might be, I told him I need to discuss this issue with the manufacturer and that is would take a day or more. He, of course, went on one of his monologues about how successful he is and how he needs this printer to work so he doesn't lose production for the holidays... but I don't care. He's just a shady, slimy con artist, using Mexico as a way to outsource cheap labor. Screw him. If he wants to put words in my mouth and get me in trouble after all I did for him, he can wait til Monday.

TL;DR - Slimy business man who lies and cheats the system to get what he wants, needs my technical expertise, until he betrays me. Now he can just wait.

So background..this is my girlfriends petty revenge inspired by me. My girlfriend is a server at a Hibachi grill in Laurel, Maryland. She works with this tall asian girl now referred to as TAG. anyways TAG always asks my girlfriend to switch shifts with her because of unknown reasons. However, my girlfriend never asks any one to replace her. Mainly because it's her primary source of income being a college student. This one saturday TAG takes off on saturday and that happened to be the saturday that my girlfriend needed to take off for a wedding. My girl asked if she could take off because of the wedding. TAG informs her that she actually needs that day off because she has an exam the upcoming monday. maybe TAG doesn't realize but when you work, you can't just take off because of an exam. anyways my girlfriend reluctantly said okay. Luckily she foudn someone to replace her..but this is where the super petty revenge happens. 

Today, (thursday) TAG texts my girl if she can replace her shift on friday. my girlfriend was about to say yes...but I remembered you fine folk at petty revenge. So i told my girl to tell her that she has an exam on monday so she can't take her shift. now she has to work. petty revenge ftw..

also as a sidenote..TAG often tells the manager she can't work because she's ""sick"" but my girlfriend knows her friends and knows that she goes out and parties and drinks while my gf has to work for her, but my gf is too nice to say anything. ",Work revenge.,81

As such she has been unable to do most of the chores, and of the food preparation, or even go to work (due to having to be on her feet all day at work) leaving me a bear's share of the responsibilities. For the most part I am happy to do what I can to make her recovery all the easier.

How I have been wronged: Sometimes however I feel she could be a weensy more patient when I am making her food for her, or maybe not snap at me when I don't put her refilled water cup within easy reach.

Revenge: So my girlfriend is very particular about the neatness of some things, specifically her sandwich preparation. It's got to be neat, in the center, with no meat or cheese sticking out the side of the sandwich. For some reason how it looks before she turns it into human waste is important. Since I work very early in the morning, each night before I go to bed, I prep her breakfast and lunch and leave it where she has access to it. But every night I make her sandwich I flip one of the pieces of bread so it is pointing the opposite direction of the other slice of bread.

evencorey,10,15,1omvhv,35,"Typing on a mobile device, so sorry for the wall of text, formatting, blabla 

It's a normal evening here at the hotel, but it's quiet, quieter than normal for a Friday evening. Usually the customers are in the common areas partying and making a mess of everything that I had just finish cleaning. But nope, not today. They must have all been at the clubs and bars around town. It was peaceful, I liked my peace. I work alone here in the evenings, no smelly co-workers to keep me company, no boss to watch me like a cat ready to attack at the slightest error, nothing. Just me, the receptionists downstairs, to which i never venture, my keys, and floor upon floor of empty corridors stretching into forever.

Then it came. The phone call. The call that was to change everything. The Reception desk had again come up with some task for me to complete just so they can have their fun telling a simple lowly hotel worker as myself what to do. ""The customer in room 413 needs an extra accommodation, and he wants it now.""

Here we go I already knew what was coming. A customer in one of our premium rooms wants an extra bed. Usually customers are very pleasant here, but this time it was different. I knew he was already devilishly thinking of ways to make my night hell. I could feel it as soon as I knocked on the door. He opens. He is a giant of a man, at 2 meters tall. Well built, hair is neatly groomed, an his suit probably cost him more than I make in 3 months. He probably makes that kind of money in a week anyway. ""Good ev-"" ""Just make the bed"". He cut me off. Fuck. Okay, fine. Ill make the bed, your excellency.
""And hurry, Im late for a meeting."" ..Which actually just meant meeting up with some woman in an exclusive club somewhere. He was kind of smiling in that way that you know he just thinks of you as some kind of slave..

Oh well, I begin making the bed. All is going to plan until he starts talking to someone on the phone in a foreign language which I understand. His mistake, as he thought since I started to speak English, he assumed I couldn't speak the language of his people. ""Damn foreigners"" and ""Stupid hotel employee can't make beds"" were amongst his words that he spat into the phone with whoever was listening.

I got furious. Not at that, really, but for some reason, he laughed about it in such a way that it made me feel lower than dirt. He was mocking me in his own language, assuming I couldn't understand. It took guts not to show emotion. He smiled at me in a way to test if I could understand. He suspected nothing. 

I had a plan. I made the best looking bed I have ever made. I tended every fucking crease of those sheets so neatly that the bed looked something out of a luxury magazine when I was done. I was proud. Fucking proud. The whole time the man slowly becoming more infuriated at me doing my damn job the best I have ever done it. I loved it each passing second. 

With each accommodation comes with an assortment of supplies, such as glasses, drinks, candy, towels, soaps and shampoos, a bath robe, the list goes on. The man, already exasperated enough with his petty waiting, motioned for me rudely to just finish up. I wanted revenge, naturally. 

So as I was leaving, I quickly came up with a equally devilish plan myself. I snagged the candy from his side of the his bed (careful not to take anyone else's) and rewarded myself with it as I walked away from the battlefield in petty victory. I hope he notices. 
The candy was amazing

FilmYak,9,18,1omq6q,41,"This happened to me a couple of hours ago at the Hollywood Bowl.  Heads up: the revenge is minimal, sorry.  But the awesome is, well... awesome.

The Bowl has several spots where you can buy booze, but tonight was crazy. Every single spot had a massive line.  I ended up at the wine bar, which is exactly what it sounds like.  Looks like a normal bar (albeit outdoors), and you line up around the edge of the bar and try to get the bartenders to serve you.  There had to be 70 people waiting, and 3 bartenders.  But the lines at the concession stands were worse, so I settled in.  (Even though it was a wine bar, they also served other drinks.  I just wanted a beer for me and a water for my wife -- this will be important momentarily.)

Also, to be a stickler for accuracy, locals are aware that you can bring your own alcohol to most Bowl shows, but this was a leased event.  That is, a band booked the venue, and that means you can't bring your own booze, which is why the lines were so long.  Also, you are normally free to bring bottles of wine, beer, etc.  Except as a leased event, no glass is allowed in the actual seating area. 

So this is a wine bar.... every wine order, they have to open the bottle of wine and pour it into a giant plastic cup. And for white wine, they then put the plastic cup inside a larger plastic holder (looks like a popcorn bowl) and fill the sides with ice.  This takes a while.

So, I'm waiting. There is one person being served, then 2 more people in front of me.  Until Douche Dude and his date see a space by the bar and ease on up to get served next, cutting off the 3 of us who've been waiting. Nuh-uh.

I tap him on the shoulder and point out that there's a line, and he's gonna get behind me. He sheepishly apologizes and moves behind me. (Busted!)

The guy in front of me then turns to face me. ""Man, welcome to LA.""  We start chatting. Eventually it's his turn, and he orders 2 bottles, letting the bartender know he'd be back for more later.

She then said the bar was closing down as soon as the main band went on stage.

So he doubled his order.  4 bottles of wine.  2 of them were white, so now she's gotta do the whole ice thing.  With a massive queue of people all around.

He starts joking with his date about me. ""Guy just wants a bottle of wine and now he's gotta wait for us and we're getting four.""  And he turns to me and asks what kind of wine I'm getting.

""A beer and a water.""

""Woah. That's it?"" 

And he calls the bartender back and orders them both for me, puts it on his tab.  Won't take no for an answer, says it's an expense account anyway.

He said he's usually the guy who enforces social justice but I beat him to it, so the drinks were on him.  And I get to my seat before the show starts. =)

tl;dr: I force a queue cutter to the back of the line, guy he cut in front of buys me a round of drinks. Booyah!",Concert booze awesomeness,59

WELCOME-THRILLHO,88,163,1olzvj,759,"I had a primo (by fluke/right timing) parking space today just outside the entrance to my bank. When I came out and got in the van I noticed a white Caddy stopped in the lot to the right of me. The parking lot is horseshoe shaped and you enter on one end and out the other. As I just came out of the bank I wanted to make sure I had my papers in order thusly not putting it in reverse the second I got in my van.

BEEP BEEP goes the Caddy. I look over my right shoulder and see the car with blinker on to go into my spot when I leave. I continue reading my deposit slip and hear BEEEEEEEEEEP. I wait a few more agonizing seconds (for the Caddy owner not me) and drop 'er down into reverse.

I begin my painfully slow backup. And then pull a three point back up turn to get myself straightened up. However, on the third back up I inch slowly towards the Caddy and as I get pretty close I hear BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP. I continue on my reverse journey and see the Caddy start to reverse to avoid me all while horn a blaring. 

Just then, another vehicle pulls in the lot. Remember I am slowly backing up and so is the Caddy. Caddy stops and I get as close as I dare. Just then, an elderly lady drives in the wrong way and eyes my now vacant spot. She stops, looks at me and I wave her in. It was the only spot vacant in the small lot (street parking is plentyfull but is meter parking and the lot is free).

I know the driver of the Caddy did not see the lady take the space as they were staring at my backside. At this point I noticed my rear window was a bit dirty so I pretty much emptied the washer fluid onto my back window and the hood of the Caddy. I slowly pull away and reveal my magic.

BubbleRyder,18,31,1olx7m,116,"So... this can only be described as pettyrevenge if you realize that MURDER would have been my preferred actual revenge... (j/k).

I was in a bad place. Recently divorced, living in a new town and studying textbooks that were way above my head. Totally stressed out, with volatile emotions pouring out of me - as if I was re-enacting a Carrie Mathison 'Homeland' bipolar freakout... no joke, I was a wreck. 

So, this one Friday night - it's about 11pm, snowing and freezing, and I'm leaving the University library for my drive home. I've been at school all day long, basically failing my classes and feeling miserable about myself. The only consolation I have is that I'm driving a 4x4 Jeep, and the parking structure is covered at my apartment - so I should be able to stay warm and dry, hop in the shower, and go to dream-land once I get home, sleeping in until late Saturday morning. I'm paying around $150 per month for that parking spot, but during the winter it's totally worth it. 

When I get home, however, someone has parked their car in my spot! ""WTF!!?"" I think to myself, and just sit there in my car for about 5 minutes, really irritated. There are no other places to park my car, except for the street - and the meter maids start their Saturday rounds at 7am. 2 hour parking max, so I'll need to move my car at 9am... but damn I wanted to sleep longer, and shit - I pay for that space! ""Fuck you, Honda Civic! You're probably some dude boning your girlfriend for the night, and you just take my parking spot... I just got my ass spread open by my failing grades and my wife left me just a few weeks ago!"" The red steam was pouring out of my ears by now. 

I got even more angry when I realize that the closest parking spot was 3 blocks away, in knee-high snow... so I started to contemplate my revenge. The first thought was to call a Tow truck, but there's no way it could fit into the garage. Second thought, write a scathing note and place it on the dude's window. ""Not good enough,"" I thought. 

Suddenly, the idea lightbulb went off in my brain. I scanned the garage for people, cameras, any signs of life. None. So I jumped out of my Jeep, and grabbed my car's jack and torque wrench. Quickly, I squatted low, out of sight near the Civic's rear wheel. My plan was to remove all 4 wheels, and then lower the car (gently) to the ground, resting on all 4 rotors. ""Ha! Brilliant!"" I would have propped the wheels up nearby, in a solid declaration: ""Fuck you - I wasn't trying to steal anything, I'm just pissed. Have fun putting your wheels back on.""  Before I could get started, however, I quickly realized that the wheels had locking lug bolts - so I wouldn't be able to remove the wheels. ""Damn!""

Plan B. Outside the garage were some very large tree branches. VERY large, like 10-12 feet long, and 4 feet in diameter with all the branches on them. The wood had frozen solid and they simply broke off the trees. I decided to gather as many as would fit, and placed them on top of the Civic. There weren't enough loose branches, so like a maniacal, heaving Hercules, I pulled and twisted and grunted and cracked more branches off the tree. My hands were freezing and bleeding, but I didn't care. I dragged all of those behemoth branches through the snow until I came into the covered garage, where (with all my might) I put them on top of the Civic's roof and hood. Each one weighed about 50 pounds, I'm guessing - but I was super careful and tried neither to crush nor scratch the car. After all, if I was going to get caught, I wanted it to be for a ""practical joke"", not for destruction of property. 

But then I thought, ""Fuck it,"" and I pulled the stupid plastic hubcaps off his wheels and threw them in a dumpster a few houses down the street. Then I went inside my apartment, and cried until I fell asleep.

Dylando,13,17,1olm96,67,"Backstory:
 For all Freshmen, Sophomores, and Juniors at my school (grade 9,10,&amp; 11), there was a PSAT today. Being a Junior, I wanted to make the most out of this before I actually take the SATs in the spring. Obviously, these don't affect your grades and chances of getting into colleges and such, but I'd still like to understand a small amount of what I'm going to expect.

well, there just so happens to be someone sitting behind me that just loves to try to piss me off. Today was the usual, except I was actually trying to concentrate, so it was starting to get on my nerves. 

He was doing stupid things like blowing on my hair, pushing my back forward with his fists or knees, and pulling my shirt out from behind me so that my back was exposed. All of this was DURING the actual test, not during any breaks

The one thing that genuinely got by blood boiling was this next part. He had a mechanical pencil with a sharp end to it, so as I was bubbling in answers, he would press that part into my shoulder blade softly, and press until the point where it was painful, but didn't break skin. That was the point of no return.

(I'd also like to say that I didn't do anything, nor have I ever done anything to provoke stuff like this. I'm a very passive person, and I don't tend to fight back unless I there's something that's gone too far)


The revenge:
During the second break, the person sitting behind me just so happened to drop that extremely sharp pencil (for those who want to know, it's [this](http://www.staples.com/Paper-Mate-ClearPoint- Mechanical-Pencil-Starter-Set-05mm-2-Pack/product_615722) pencil, same brand and model.) He was talking to a friend next to him, and didn't notice it, so into my pocket it went. A few minutes go by, our proctor tells us to begin the next part of the PSAT, and he starts looking around. Turns out that was his only pencil, and he didn't suspect me at all. 

In the end, that wasted a good 5 minutes of him looking for it during the time of the test, and another minute or so to get another from the proctor. It sure does work well, and I may even use it during class.

Nothing extreme, but hey, a brand new semi-expensive pencil and something fun to listen to

Rickys_HD_SPJs,11,44,1olca3,89,"Having read Kraeheb's story of coin counting and the ire it raises in innocent counter-clerks, it reminded me of a petty revenge story of mine.

I had lived in Seoul, teaching english, and had decided to keep a long-distance relationship going. The results of this relationship were a couple of expensive red-eye flights and an astronomical phone bill. I'm talking four figures. I should mention this was the early aughts before unlimited this and free nights that. I had missed the pay date by two days when I received a courtesy call about the bill. Of course, Cingular's idea of courtesy was more of a pay-or-else notification. It is their money after all, so I went to the local shop the next day.

I was greeted by a somewhat surly shop girl who thankfully took partial payment and assured me that my line would stay operational if I paid the remainder the next week. She took a payment of $400, leaving me with a balance of around eight hundred. And as you can guess, my phone was cut off the next day. I returned two days later and asked her specifically why she told me I had a week to pay only to have my service shut off less than 24 hours later. She responded that it wasn't her policy and I should try paying my bills on time. Ok...Ok.

I had the money, but the idea of shelling out 12 hund for a phone bill gave me the shakes so that is why I didn't pay all at once. I returned the next day, scanned the shop floor for said surly sow, and entered to pay my bill. Having been to the bank, I emptied a bag containing eight hundred dollars in banded singles. Ah, but this moo was quick and she insisted I use the new self-serve payment center. I told her I was wary of those cash counting machines and advised her to start counting as they were closing soon.

""Eight years ago, I was an intern for a sports writer, covering my first Knicks game. There's an area at MSG where the celeb fans go after the game if they are willing to give an interview. There were two that night: New York Jet Keyshawn Johnson, and Hanging With Mr. Cooper star Mark Curry. 

I approached Johnson and asked him politely for an interview. He replied 'nah, kid. I'm good.' 

I was crestfallen. My first attempt at a big interview and I was shot down and belittled. By someone who was standing in the interview area! So I sheepishly approached Curry - and he couldn't have been more kind, classy, and helpful. He was awesome and engaging, and I was able to write a great story.

There are two lessons to take from this story. One, be nice to everyone - you never know who will be introducing you 8 years later. Two, Keyshawn Johnson is a dick.

gerudo_pirate,105,755,1oklfu,1587,"My ex-boyfriend (while we were still together) lived in a house with 2 other people. One guy lived on the other side of the house, and was never there.The room next to my ex's was occupied by a female teacher. She was honestly one of the most messed up people I've ever met, severe alcholic, well into her forties, kept hitting on everyone else who came into the house (most of whom were in their early twenties). 

The thing that annoyed both of us most, however, was that she and her on-and-off boyfriend kept knocking on our door with stupid questions a few minutes after we started having sex. Mostly it was asking if the internet was working for us, but it could be about anything, and although we always told them we were busy, it was still extremely annoying to be interrupted by it. And it wasn't like the house wasn't noisy, in fact, we knew that the teacher could hear us having sex, because she told us she enjoyed hearing it, and that we should cuddle more afterwards, yup, awkward as fuck.

One night, we came home. She was already wasted. We are about to go into my ex's room, when the doorbell rings. My ex opens it, and lets in a guy in his early twenties. The guy had come for the teacher, and they went into her room together. I was in a very giddy mood, being both drunk and stoned, and decided I would eavesdrop on them. Turned out the guy was a friend of the teacher's boyfriend, and they were talking about how rough the relationship was, because they were in another fight. Then, I heard her trying to seduce him, him saying he couldn't do that to his friend, her saying he didn't need to find out, really corny soap-opera stuff. After a while I can hear them as they start making out. I decide this is my chance, I quickly report back to my ex about what has happened, and take a moment to suppress all my giggles. I go back into the hallway and start knocking on her door, calling her name. At first they turned quiet, but she didn't answer. I knock more, telling her it's me and I have something really important to ask her. She says: ""What is it?"", I ask her if she could come to the door, after a minute she comes. I then proceed to ask her if her internet is working. She says she doesn't know, I ask if she could check, she says not right now, I ask her if she can check later, she says sure, I ask how long that would be, she says she isn't sure. Can she give me an indication? Maybe 15 minutes. I continue to ask her a few times to please not forget, trying to drag the conversation out as long as possible. When it's over I go back to my ex's room. A few minutes later the guy leaves.

I know it's not much, but it gave me an intense feeling of satisfaction. ","When you interrupt me having sex, I'll screw up your cheating.",2342

One day, he assigned a little project.  He randomly handed us pages from a coloring book of state birds, and we were to write a two page paper  on the one we got in the next week and color the picture.

I got the cardinal.  I wrote my two pages. My research informed me that only male cardinals are red.  Females are brown with a reddish tinge on the outside of their wings.  I knew he'd expect a red bird, so I colored a female. I turned in my essay and picture on the due date. 

Now, one of my issues with this teacher was his public shaming. If someone didn't turn something in or had made an obvious mistake, he announced it to the class. This practice was actually banned by the school district later that same year.  I knew he'd go through all our papers and make comments. I patiently waited for him to see mine.

Cygnus_X1,18,35,1ojm4a,155,"I just found out about this subreddit, I figured I'd tell one of my favourite stories. Sorry for the wall of text.

**td;dr** Don't bring a nice car to a packed movie theater if you're afraid of scratches.

I was 18 at the time, it hadn't been long since I got my license and saved for my first car (bought some smaller model Volkswagen). Went to the movies to celebrate with my then girlfriend (now wife).

As we pull in to the theater we see a guy driving what must have been a brand new lambo. We were in the right lane, we was in the left, so I gave him a thumbs up. I don't know why -- I worked with nice cars for most of the day as a secretary for an auto repair shop but his still blew me away that it was the instinctive thing to do. He looks at me and says something like ""It's a good first car, treat it well until you finish school"".

Sure enough he goes into the theater along with us, which is PACKED. I notice two parking spots next to each other, he must have noticed them too because he goes right for them as well.

When I say right for them I mean he takes up BOTH spaces. He just looks at me and says ""Sorry, don't want to scratch the paint."" I want to emphasize that the lot was packed. We went around the entire theater parking lot a few times -- nothing except handicap spaces.

Like I give a fuck. I return to the where the guy parked. The idiot parked mostly to the right and I had more than enough room to squeeze my smallish VW into the left parking spot. I was very good at parking cars tightly from helping them put away the cars at work at the end of each day (yes, someone without a license drove 30 feet at a time on private property every day -- deal with it). So I have no problem putting it in. Because I'm a gentleman and an asshole at the same time, I parked it in reverse so that she could get out easily and I could block off his driver's side door as much as possible (to the point where I had to get out through the passenger door).

The park was perfectly legal. I was between both yellow lines, he was the one crossing over.

I guess he was also in the same showing of the Matrix as us, because we saw him in the parking lot trying to figure out how to get into his car. He sees me and starts telling me how much of an asshole I am and says I'm lucky he didn't key my car. I tell him he's more than welcome to, I wouldn't notice a few more scratches on it (the paint was scratched like someone drove it through a gravel for a month when I bought it). I then followed up with telling him he's lucky I don't feel like trying to get into my car from between those 2 inches that separate the passenger doors.

vulchiegoodness,38,53,1oj0tf,78,"Theres this bum thats been living around my apartment complex for months. idk what his name actually is, but we called him samson because of how fucking big he was. we thought he was semi-ok when we moved in, he’d say hello and the like, but was always begging. One of my neighbors took a shine to him, i guess they knew him a bit better since they had been there longer. This was only a couple weeks after we moved in, and they told us that apparently, he used to live in my apartment with the last people who lived there before me. they kicked him out when they left, and he’s been homeless ever since. upon hearing this, we softened a bit, and gave him food once in a while, and generally tried to be nice, but distant with him. 

then he disappeared for a week or 2. when he came back, he wasn't looking too good. much skinnier, with a horrible cough. and then soon, he got more and more aggressive, and increasingly psychotic. He’d try picking fights with us, taunting and swinging at us, following up up from the car, to our door. (it's an open design, stairs and doors face the elements. and yes, it's a royal bitch in the winter or when it's raining.) Naturally, we told him to piss off, and stopped helping him completely. 

thats when he flipped out. started ripping the screens off the windows, banging on the door, taunting our cats thru the window. all. the. time. the neighbors that were previously mentioned kept helping him, giving him food, letting him sleep on their porch. We SHARE a porch with them. so great, this asshole is sleeping on our porch. he left us alone half the time. but it was really uncomfortable, because we couldn't open the windows at all, either he would rip the screen out, or the screen would already be gone, and the bugs would get in, and our cats would get out. now, being on the 2nd floor, im not thrilled about that last option. one day, some food had gone rank in the fridge, and we threw it out. well, it smelled pretty bad in the apartment, so we HAD to open the windows a smidge just to let some fresh air in. i had thought that i had opened it just enough that our cat couldn't get thru, and the screen was on, no sign of samson, so i thought we were good. nope. 

an hour into it, and here comes samson. this asshole sees my cat in the window, minding his own business, and he decides to start taunting the cat. RIPS the freaking screen out, and my cat takes off, hissing and lunging at samson. samson starts swinging and hissing BACK! I run out, grab the kitty, and go back inside. I called the office and told them - “look, this has gone on long enough. ya gotta do something about this asshole. I dont want me or my cats getting sick or injured by this jerk” they assured me that they had a plan in place to apprehend him. ok, whateves. Why not the police? police werent going to do anything. everyone needs a place to sleep, they say. and i don't think they really believed me, not at first. they never saw him, they said they had been looking for him, but always managed to disappear when the office people came around. this goes on. no help from the neighbors.their kids liked him, and they kept feeding him and letting him sleep on the porch. 

A few months of this go by. samson is still hanging around. 

Im trying to not be the bad guy here. I try to take pity on lesser creatures. i really do.  but last night, i couldn't take it anymore. he sick, aggressive, crazy, and im tired of being harassed daily. and i know it's a little thing, but i couldn't even open our window, for fucks sake, because of this loon. so, since the office staff ‘never seem to catch him’ hanging around, even when we told them where he was hiding out, plan was formed. poison the food? shove him off the porch? i do have a baseball bat.. no, no. we’ll apprehend him ourselves, and march him up to the office, and let the county deal with him.

Today I got on, each seat except one was filled. I walk to near the back of the bus but still kind of close to the door, so that I can get out relatively quickly when I'm going to get off if I don't need to move back further to allow more people on. In the seat I'm standing next to I notice is a lady, mid twenties and dressed nicely, sitting with her bag on the seat next to her in the window seat. At first I thought she was saving it for a friend a few stops away or something. Nope, whole ride the bag sat there.

Each morning I almost always stand, I don't mind, I didn't need the seat, but that doesn't mean someone else wouldn't have liked it. As more people come on, people who have to stand, I get rather annoyed that she doesn't move her bag. It's not a large book bag or something, just a small hand bag or a purse or whatever.

So we reach downtown and I see from the corner of my eye she rings the bell to signal the driver to stop, the pettiness takes root.
As the bus is coming to a stop I look out the window, pretending to not see her getting up to leave. Each morning I have these earbuds that block out sound, they're pretty good but I usually keep my music low to hear people. She gets up and says something like ""Excuse me... excuse me sir."" Sounding more and more annoyed, she eventually taps me on the shoulder... right as the bus starts to pull away. She mutters some stuff calling me an idiot or something else of equivalency and something about her important job. After she sits down and rings the bell again I cant help but have a little grin, no one else said anything. Justice served.

This story happened only hours ago at the DMV.  
As you know, the DMV can be quite busy. When I arrived, the parking lot was full and several people were circling. After circling once or twice, I decided to wait by the entrance for the next person leaving and ask if I could take their spot. This worked nicely.  
  
As I was leaving the DMV, I saw a lady parked outside the entrance waiting patiently. We'll call her PL (Patient Lady). I asked PL if she was waiting for a spot and offered her to take mine.  
I walk to my car and PL navigated light traffic to catch up to me. In the meantime Impatient Lady (IL)  sees me walking to my car and tries to position herself to take my spot. I motion that PL is waiting for it and IL ignores me.  
  
I get in my car and I reverse out of my spot. As I'm backing out of the spot, IL inches so close to me that I literally cannot move forward. Now I've got some more room to back up, but I'm not letting IL take the spot that PL has been waiting for. She's got enough room to go past me but not enough room to pull into the spot. So I refuse to back up any further.  
I'm sitting at an angle in the middle of the parking lot giving IL no room to pull into the spot. I roll down my window and say to IL ""Can you let me move?"" to which she responds ""Back up""  
  
So I shut off my car, tossed my keys on the dashboard and waited.   
  
IL takes about a minute before she decided to back up an inch. I continue to wait. She backs up another inch. I continue to wait. Finally she gives up and decided to drive straight past me. As she drives past me she yells to me ""You don't have nothing better to do?"" to which I reply ""I prefer to be courteous to people""  
  
I'll probably think of something wittier I should have said while in the shower tomorrow but for now I take delight in knowing that she continued to circle the parking lot.  
  
**tl;dr:** Lady tries to steal spot, I become stubborn as a mule.  
  
**Epilogue:** Unfortunately after IL left and I left the spot, some other asshole swooped in out of nowhere and stole the spot before PL could get it. Sorry PL, I tried but you gotta make an effort too.

There are five stalls in the washroom I entered, and someone was in the middle one, so naturally, I went into one on the end.

I can't get anyone to grab me any, cause I'm not at home. The only way to fix this, is to go over to the next stall and grab some from there. But there was someone in it. All I could hope was that I could get in there and wipe fast enough that he wouldn't walk out and see me as I was changing stalls.

Mexiterp,234,657,1ohyjy,1650,"I'd love to take credit for this, but my friend was actually the evil genius.

Back in college my buddy and I worked at one of those ""goofy shit on the walls &amp; mozzarella sticks"" type of corporate American restaurants. The managers made shitty salaries so they relied heavily on performance based year-end bonuses. One of the key performance measures was cost control, meaning they'd get bonuses if they could keep their operating costs under certain levels.

Unfortunately, all of the managers were mean, bitter, broken people who took their life's frustrations out on the staff. None of us liked working for them, but we put up with it out of necessity.

One day, I'm at work and I notice my buddy drop a steak knife into the trash can as he's clearing off plates at the dish washing station. I figure it's an accident, so I reach into the trash to pull it back out but he grabs my wrist and says ""No, leave it."" I give him a puzzled look. After looking around to make sure nobody is listening he leans in and whispers:

""I've been doing it for weeks. Every time one of the managers insults me or pisses me off, I throw something in the trash. Knives, full condiment bottles...nothing big and nothing that we (the staff) would desperately miss, but enough to affect their costs. It helps me deal with their bullshit, knowing I'm hitting them where it hurts.""

Realizing the brilliance of this tactic, I followed his lead.

That year they missed out on a good part of their bonuses and 2 of the managers quit. It's still the most satisfying revenge I've ever gotten.","Restaurant managers screw over staff, get hit in the wallet",2307
kcrbacon,10,20,1ohj27,126,"This is my husband's story, not mine. However, it is too good to not share.

He works as a maintenance guy at a large apartment complex in our city. This particular complex has some of the worst apartments in the area, but they're pretty cheap and often rented by college students and lower income families. 

In winter time, there are sections of the parking lots that are blocked off with saw horses with big ""no parking"" signs so that snow can be piled there after the lots are plowed. The maintenance staff began having problems with one resident who would ignore the signs and park in this area. This resident drove what was probably a $35,000-$40,000 truck (likely the reason he lived in that apartment complex) and was always that driver that would do really shitty parking jobs so that no one could park near his car. He got the bright idea into his head that the snow piling area would be a great spot to park his car, and would go out of his way to throw the saw horse sign out of the way every time.

One day, my husband finally got sick of it and put a towing notice on the car. At this particular area, the towing notice is a sticker that adheres to the window of the car. This set truck guy off, and he stormed into the main office to complain. My husband and one of his co-workers was in there chatting with the office staff. This particular co-worker was a 6', muscular black guy who worked out daily.

Truck guy turns out to be a little punk of a guy who came in and yelled, ""Who put that fucking sticker in my window!?!""

My husband's co-worker replied in an even tone, ""Can you repeat that?""

Truck guy was caught off-guard and repeated nervously, ""Who put that sticker in my window?""

At this point, the manager walked in (unfortunately) and truck guy turned on him.

So to set the scene, I have a bunk-bed desk combo. It's got a bed on top, with a full desk as the bottom ""bunk"". I also have a bedroom door that closes, but doesn't latch properly. My cat knows this very well, as he just has to gently nudge the door to open it. He also loves to cuddle. Really sweet kitty.

However, he's also very pushy about getting what he wants. And boy does he know what buttons of mine to push. In the mornings after/during the rest of the family getting ready to head out, he will ignore all of them, and head straight to my room. There, he will proceed to meow loudly until I am awake. Once I'm awake, he will begin to find trouble until I'm up. He'll jump on my hobby desk, he'll chew on cables, and no amount of shouting or pillow throwing will get him to stop. So I'll relent and lay down somewhere so he can cuddle (he feels he can't get up to my bed).

Well, one saturday morning I go through the routine at 7am (when I wanted to sleep in, mind you), and about five minutes after the cuddles commenced, he stops, hops off, and goes back to his bed. So I waited. I waited and waited. Much later in the day, I call out to him to cuddle with me. He was in a deep sleep, so I stood there and bugged him until he woke up and got out of bed. I go lay down, and realizing what I want, he comes running. Oh how excited he was! Meowing and cuddling and head-butting and purring. It was very cute.

out-of-phase,56,185,1ogixw,910,"A few years ago I was driving across the country to Seattle. From Ohio (where I live), it's a good 5 day drive if you go at a good pace but don't exhaust yourself. It was winter time and I was driving through Montana. I'd been driving for a good 10 hours and it was starting to snow pretty hard. Since I was approaching the mountains, I figured I'd go ahead and pull over at the next motel I found.

I found one at the next exit -- a local place that looked quaint and pleasant and didn't seem to be too crowded. I had some work to get done, so I asked if they had wifi, and they said yes. I checked in, made some coffee, and pulled out my laptop.

After connecting to their wifi, I noticed that it was *monumentally* slow. I'm talking dial-up, AOL 2.0 slow. Slow to the point that even a simple page, google.com for instance, would take close to a minute to load, or just not load at all.

I called the front desk and told them their internet was acting up. The dude who answered sounded irritated, huffed at me and told me not to expect too much because this was a rural town and it was the best they could get. I politely asked him if could at least check on the router for me -- he sighed and said, ""The IT guy ain't here, he's the one who knows how to reset the router."" I heard giggling in the background, and he hung up on me.

There was no way I was going to get any work done. I had to view my email in old school HTML, and even then it would take forever, or not at all. I was pretty irritated, so I decided to try something. It was a long-shot, but it was at least worth a go.

I opened up my browser and typed in ""192.168.0.1"" -- nothing. I tried ""192.168.2.1"" and voila! I was presented with a login screen. I typed in ""admin"" for the username and ""password"". Wrong. I tried again without entering a password, and bam! I was IN.

My initial plan wasn't very sinister. I was just going to try to remotely restart the router. But then I found something interesting. They were cutting the bandwidth for the guests, and allocating almost all of it to the front desk. They were even kind enough to label the front desk computer ""front_desk"".

I reversed the settings, so that the front desk was getting almost no bandwidth, and the guests were getting the majority evenly. Then I changed the router's name to ""Best_Guest_Internet_Ever"". To top it off, I changed the router admin password.

I got a lot of work done after that. The wireless stopped a couple times -- I'm assuming because the guy at the front desk was unplugging and plugging back in the router, but after that it stayed steady. I have a feeling he didn't know how to do a hard reset.

pettyCampCounselor,15,29,1ogavy,60,"Throwaway account since this I'm still a bit embarrassed about how petty this was and that the victim was a child.

Set up: I spent a summer as a camp counselor when I was 19 and the camp director had a six-year-old son that was in a whiney, I'm-gonna-tell-my-dad-on-you stage. He would poke into counselors' hanging out time and find something to complain about even though his dad never followed up (probably aware of how irritating it was and not wanting to encourage him). Also, the kid was terrified of water and swimming. I think he watched too many Red Cross Lifeguard trainings and was psyched out about the idea of drowning.

Anyway, the end of the summer comes and we all go to a beach house to take time off after 12 weeks of too many children. One morning, some us get up early to look for shells and the only great ones we could find were ones that would run away from us. So, we fill a bucket with sand crabs with great shells and bring them back to the pier by the beach house to pull out the inhabitants for the sake of souvenirs.

While we're learning that you can't just pull a crab out of his shell whole and that it's kinda gruesome, the director's kid comes up and starts whining that we're killing the poor crabs and pleading with us to stop. We had already felt guilty and decided, but it the kid was just so irritating that it emboldened an unrepentant attitude that made me just want to kill all of them to upset him. I didn't get petty at the crab's expense though.

Instead, I shifted gears and pretended to see something neat in the murky water that was just less than a foot below the pier. I was like ""Oh wow, you gotta see this."" The kid's like ""what?"" I say, ""You have to get really close to see."" Also, the water was fishy-smelling and full of algae, so you really couldn't see anything.

Anyway, I lay down on my chest and just hang my head over by the water and he does the same. 

Kid: I don't see it.
Me: You have to look really close.

As he gets his face close to the water, I just swing my arm in and cover his head with a splash of algae-ridden canal water. He immediately gets teary, yelling, ""I'm gonna tell my dad."" He ran off and never bothered us again. His dad gave me disappointed looks the rest of the weekend, but never said anything. You could tell it was a mix of a guy not liking someone messing with their kid, but also totally knowing how irritating the kid could be.

I’m not exactly sure as to how many victims fell prey during the Ex-Lax saga, but I’m just glad that my little run in with the substance didn’t take place on school grounds. Thankfully, I was drugged at an all guy sleep over. Don’t judge me, I was in 9th grade. This was the year that I was introduced to both marijuana and Ex-Lax… 2004 was my 80′s.

As I was saying, two of my friends and I were crashing at a mutual friend’s house. I’m not going to mention any names, but one of us had weed. Even though ~~we~~ they may not partake in that activity anymore, weed was something that we felt the need to try. Keep in mind, we were total fucking amateurs when it came to smoking pot. Let’s just say that our smoking device consisted of a soda can. After poking about 20 pinholes in our poor man’s bowl, we trucked through a foot of snow towards our smoking destination. Houston, we have lift off.

After a solid ten minute coughing spree, we made our way back to the family room. To my surprise, there was a plate of brownies waiting for us on the coffee table. Not even 5 minutes after I sat my high ass down, a physical challenge was thrown my way. “Hey bromemeoth, I bet you can’t eat three brownies in less than three minutes”. Are you kidding me? That’s child’s play. As soon as I crushed brownie number two, the room erupted with laughter and finger pointing. Fuck! Those bastards finally got the kid who started the whole Ex-Lax epidemic. Right then and there, my night turned into a waiting game.

Seeing as my jeans were already soaked from the snow, I figured I might as well borrow a pair of sweatpants (and not wear any boxers under them… you know, just in case). Hours passed, and nothing had happened. At this stage in the game, only two of us were awake. Congratulations guys, the only thing I was feeling was gas—or so I thought. On a whim, I decided that I was entitled to rip ass in the face of one of the two sleeping beauties. After all, they did poison me with chocolate laxatives.

So there I was, pointing my ass at a face like it was a loaded gun, and you wouldn’t believe how quickly that simile turned into reality.

We were up 3-1 with four minutes left and this asshole that has been complaining to the referee goes and scores two goals. He then proceeds to run around the whole field taunting everyone on our team. Not cool, this guy has no respect for the game. 

A minute later we're tied 3-3 with two minutes left to play. He fouls one of our players around the half line and I place the ball to take the kick. Now, this little shit plants his ass directly in front of the ball and starts to untie, then retie his shoe. 

Being a little angry at losing our lead in the game I decide not to take any more shit from this guy. But of course, the revenge has to be petty so I didn't say a word to him. 

I ""accidentally"" push my knee forward over the ball while he's still tying his shoe and nudge him so he falls RIGHT in a mud puddle. He flopped too so his whole back got completely covered in mud. The referee didn't even see! 

It was the funniest thing ever, he's sitting on is ass in the mud, yelling at the ref while everyone is laughing. Even his own team couldn't stop. Anyway I took the kick and afterwards he didn't say one more word to the ref. 

Enjoy your muddy back, asshole.

squid_kitty,26,101,1oek8y,284,"This happened a long time ago but I just recalled it the other day after burning myself in a tanning bed. It made me chuckle at what at bitch I am.

I was about thirteen and I was visiting some family in Washington state in the summer time. My grandma's boyfriend--who we were staying with--had a nice in ground pool. My cousin, who was also 13, and I were swimming in it all day. As we were swimming and playing she was pushing me into the pool and calling me names, like ""fat"" and ""porky"" (I was a chubby kid). I  was starting to get mad about it but I noticed she was starting to burn from the sun. I looked at my arms and face and decided I could be in the sun longer; and, not be as badly burnt. I applied some sunscreen one last time to myself then threw it away with the Aloe Vera lotion. So we continued to play in the pool and the sun the rest of the day. 

At this point she noticed that she had turned lobster red and was starting to feel pain from it. So we go inside to my grandmother for help. My grandma had, had a few Screw Drivers and Rum and Cokes at this point so she is pretty easy to convince to do about anything. I tell her first to go get the Aloe to see if that helps. To everyone’s surprise it’s gone. So I come up with an even better plan. Apply a mixture of baking soda and water as a paste to her skin. 

At first my grandma doesn’t buy it, she’s never heard of it before. My cousin is equally suspicious of it as well. So I go on an tell them it’s a new thing. You do the same thing with bee stings. You apply the paste and it helps remove sting from the bee sting. You apply it and let it harden. Once it has harden all the stinging pain is gone. 

What I neglected to mention is that by drawing out the sting, it actually is pulling out the stinger and drying out the area around it. Whoops. 

They buy it, hook-line-and-sinker. My grandma makes a bunch of it and slathers my cousin head to toe in it. She offers me some to try with mine, but I decline it. I tell her mine is not really bothering me and it’ll take care of itself in a couple days. I leave my cousin to dry out in the kitchen and go outside to ask my mom for some Noxzema--which actually helps with sunburns and provides a cooling sensation. 

After about 10 minutes my grandma and cousin come outside to me and my mother to ask if the paste as dried enough. I start cackling and my mom just erupts with anger and fear. She yells at me and asked what I’ve done. My grandma, who is just beyond bewildered, tells my mom about what I had recommended she do about the sun burn. My cousin just starts bawling about the pain and how stupid she feels. My mom tells my cousin to get in the shower and wash off immediately and apply some of the cream I was using. My mom tries to scold me and asks me what I was thinking. And the clearest memory I have of it is saying, still laughing “She shouldn’t have called me fat.”

TL;DR: Cousin and I were playing in pool all day. She got sun-burnt badly. I told my grandma to put baking soda paste on her, and she did. Dried out and chapped her skin even more than the sunburn did. All because she kept calling me “fat”. ",That's a nasty sunburn you got there. Maybe I can help?,385

Me and my father went to see the movie Rio. We lived in a small town in West Virginia, and we expected it to be a normal night. So, we get in the movies when these douchebaggy teenagers sit behind us. They are making a bunch of noise when this eight year old yells towards them ""Shut up, I'm trying to watch the movie."" His mother get frustrated with him and said, ""Be quiet, Jeffrey."" Those door-knobs found this as a way to joke with him. For the first part of the movie:
""Who's Jeffery? Lolz""
""*imitating mother* Shut up, Jeffery.""

For a while, these teenagers made fun of this poor little kid. My dad had enough of this. He stood up, and did something that I truely respect him for. He told those kids off, using things like:
""I remember the first time my parents let me go to the movies"" or
""You are so f*cking funny.""

What did I do during this? I looked them right in the eye and cackled. They shut up the rest of the movie. The movie was okay, but I mostly enjoyed my father telling him off. Oh, and we got thanked a couple times after the movie.

d was the biggest douchebag in our school -- if you had an opinion that he didn't agree with, he'd go apeshit crazy on you, throwing punches, swearing, etc. he had been expelled multiple times but he didn't care. he was a spoiled brat and everybody but his group of friends hated him.

at lunch, we get a free bottle of water. i already had my big waterbottle used so i decided to use this one for more... *recreational* use. it was lunch on my final day. everybody keeps their backpacks by the door (i really don't know why). i saw his fancy backpack with lots of pockets. inside he had a mess of papers -- being too lazy to put the papers neatly inside of the binder also in the backpack. 

i slowly took the backpack, watching out in case anyone sees me. i slowly take the water bottle, open it up, take a small swig, and dump the rest all over his papers, making them all pretty useless.. afterwards, i threw the bottle away and went to enjoy lunch (i think i got a burrito that day, may have been a cheeseburger)

The outdoor lighting includes countless little ""pedestal"" lights as well as a front porch light and carport light for each unit.  The townhome association replaces the bulbs in all those lights, but the individual residents pay for the electricity for the porch and carport lights.

I was on the board for quite a few years, and spent literally two years trying to convince the board to switch from incandescent to compact fluorescent bulbs.  I couldn't make any headway.  There was always yet another concern, and frequently the board president (J) would say ""we've spent too much time talking about this, I'm tabling it"".  Two years of this.

After J moved on, new board members quickly approved the use of CFs.  It was a non-issue.  I slowly came to realize just how much J had been desperate to control everything, and not let any idea that wasn't his own get a foothold.

I later got exasperated with how inefficient the board meetings were, and quit.  The few remaining board members, desperately needing another warm body, got J back onto the board.

superkrispie,43,60,1odasp,280,"This isn't my story, but a friend's from back when I was in grade school. 

My elementary school was very small, with roughly 20-30 kids in the entire grade. That being said, everyone knew each other and rumors spread pretty fast.

Most of us usually brought our own lunches to avoid whatever concoction the school served us. There was one kid in particular who was constantly stealing other kids' lunches from their cubby-holes for whatever reason. We all knew who it was but he stole lunches just often enough to not get caught. He never stole mine, but one day he stole one of my friends lunches. Note that her favorite kind of sandwich was tuna salad, so she had this every day. She told the teachers that someone had stolen her lunch and that she had a pretty good idea about who it was, but they told her that there was nothing they could do about it since we didn't have security cameras and no one saw proof of it. He denied all accusations of it. She moves on and figures he'll go on to stealing someone else's lunch, but no. Apparently his favorite kind of sandwich is also tuna salad. 

She catches on pretty quick that he's continually only stealing her lunch and it's beginning to happen more frequently. After about a week, he's stealing it every day. Finally, she's had enough.

One day, she brings two lunches to school, seemingly identical, but leaves one in her desk all day so he can't take it. The thing about the lunch in the cubby is that the sandwich is tuna salad with some added cat litter. She leaves the cat litter lunch in the cubbyhole in its usual spot. She checks after recess and sees the decoy lunch missing.

That day at lunch we all made sure to sit where we could see him enjoy his delicious litter sandwich. Sure enough, he pulls out the sandwich without looking at what's between the bread and takes a massive bite of it. He chews but his eyes suddenly grow wide as he realizes this is not your average everyday tuna sandwich. He drops the sandwich and runs to the garbage where he spits it all out. Then he takes the rest of the sandwich and lunch and dumps that too. My friend simply watched with a simple grin on her face while we all struggled to contain our laughter.

He never stole anyone's lunch again.",That'll teach him to take your lunch,340

Cue the entrance of a group of people (around 25 years old if I had to guess) who were clearly drunk.  In their drunkenness, they decide it would be a great idea to start having swimming races.  This wouldn't be a problem normally, except that they were splashing pretty much everyone in the pool by swimming so furiously.  Multiple people asked them to stop, but they would reply ""It's a pool, people get splashed, what do you expect?""

TechRiporte,37,59,1ocakb,254,"A while back, I worked for a small (50ish employees) manufacturing company doing their IT. My manager was actually managing quite a few departments due to cutbacks and was not specifically involved with IT, so I was essentially a one-man department - a combined sysadmin, tech support, developer, asset provisioning/tracking/replacement guy etc etc etc

So most of the business was on PC's, of course, but some of the managers got Macbooks (I'm fairly sure this was mainly decided because they looked pretty, as they were all bootcamped anyway), and all the company phones had been iPhones for some time. The company was going through some rough times, as everyone was at the time (a few years back), but the fancy (read: expensive) apple tech predated me. As a result though, nothing had been replaced in a long time, much of my work was centered around keeping equipment running long past it's used-by date.

So one morning a manager walks into my office (well it was the server room, but I squeezed a table in there and it beat a cubicle), lets call him Dick. Dick waltz's in and says to me ""I need a new phone and laptop, I'm leaving again tomorrow so make it snappy"", then turns around and starts walking back out of the room immediately without waiting for a response.
""Hold up Dick, what's going on, is there a problem with the current ones? I can come have a look and see if we can't get them working if you...""

""I'd say there's definitely a problem TechRiporte"", he cuts in, ""they're gone.""

No further explanation. No shame whatsoever. If anything, he seems to be getting annoyed at me now, for the gall of not reading his mind.

""They're... wait. Where are they?""

""Well they were stolen of course, while I was in [Country redacted]""

Now, Dick has been overseas for roughly 2 weeks in [Country redacted], and in the next few minutes I discerned from him that he had left them in a conference room in the hotel while he went for lunch, and when he returned they were gone. This had been on day 2 of his trip, and this was the first I was hearing of it. Before he left he made sure to angrily let me know how difficult it had made the rest of the trip to be without a phone or laptop, in a tone of voice that suggested there was something I had not done to prevent this.

So after swallowing hard and politely assuring him we'd get him sorted out before he had to leave again, I went to see my manager - this was the first stolen equipment I had dealt with and I needed some information on the insurance process. Now my manager was a top bloke - I haven't worked for better - and when I mentioned the way Dick had announced the situation he was as shocked and annoyed as I was, but he had a far better response for me.

""Is that old Lenovo still kicking around?"" (The oldest laptop we had, with 3 out of 4 USB ports broken, the top right corner of the screen distorted from being dropped, and slow as a wet walrus)

""Well yeah... I mean I had been planning on giving him the last 15"" MB, we don't have anymore of the 17"" that he had before...""

""Nah screw him. He can use the equipment we can afford to go without until he proves he can look after it like a big boy. A few months down the track if he still has them we'll look at getting him a Macbook. See if you can get one of the old blackberries up and running for him too.""

I was speechless. I checked a few more times that he wasn't joking, that I had his blessing to go ahead with this and he assured me that if Dick had a problem with it I could send him to ask my manager about it. Barely concealing my mirth, I delivered to Dick his ancient laptop and a blackberry getting old enough that the back was visibly distorted from the bulging battery. He wasn't happy, but I put on my best mournful face and apologized that ""This is the best we can do until business gets better.""

I almost felt guilty for feeling that good while at work, but the next month it got even better. He lost the blackberry on a flight, and once again appeared across my desk demanding another phone, ""And make it an iPhone this time"". He got a blackberry, and that same day I deployed the last Macbook to one of his direct reports. When he noticed, he went to my manager to complain, who told him exactly what he had told me - he would get decent equipment when he started taking care of it.

TL;DR: a manager at my work is a dick and consistently loses his equipment. He gets his toys taken away from him for a time out. I ride out on a unicorn, cigar in hand, and blow smoke rings in his face while he cries and rocks in the corner.

Tonight we had company and decided to take him to Fatburger because we'd thought it would be fun to watch his brain explode when given that many choices for a burger and because they are delicious.

I pull into the parking lot and the only open spot near the door is the handicapped one but some douchenozzle has taken half of it up with his oversized mini van.

I point out again that he was parking illegally halfway over into a handicapped spot and his enlightened retort was “So?”

The cashier looks at my face and can tell I’m pretty shook up, I’m actually debating whether to leave and so embarrassed by the loud confrontation.  She starts apologizing to me for what happened and I ask if anyone had complained about the parking and whether it was called in.  She said no but looking out the door she can see the illegal parking job and asks me to wait while she talks to her manager.

AntiAtavist,9,55,1obrj8,138,"**Backstory/The Pledge**


Yesterday at 12:40 PM, and I'm finished with my meal at a fast food restaurant that isn't called Hardy's here on the West Coast. I'm sipping on my soda, filling my time on my lunch break until I return to work (lunch is 12-1).


The woman who is on point for the register and cleaning the lobby comes around. She is pleasant and adorable (not relevant), and asks if she can take my tray with my empty wrappers. I decline, as I'm a strong, independent middle-aged man who don't need no man. I can take my tray to the trash, don't need to create more work for her. I relay this point of view.


She insists. We have a little bit of friendly banter, and she wins the verbal debate. I let her know that I feel a bit of peer pressure, and while I'm letting her take the tray because of her insistence, I wish I could take it myself.
1-0, she is leading.


**The Turn**


As I'm walking out, I see that someone has discarded some trash near the front door. I decide it's my time for retribution. That trash was picked up from the floor *so hard,* it reverberated back to the acorns the tree sprouted from. I placed it into the trash, and she had no idea. 1-1. Tie game, motherfucker.


**The Prestige**


I make it a habit to ask people if they accept tips. I used to work at Taco Bell, so I know that some places really do have to say no, especially if a manager is watching.  I had asked a worker there before, and they can't take money from customers.

But! If they find money and there's nobody to claim it, it isn't considered a tip. If money drops out of a pocket, there's nothing to be done for it when the customer is gone.

I've made it a habit to slip a couple bucks under the napkin holder that is at each table at that restaurant. It's not visible unless you move or lift up the napkin holder, which is usually only done by the workers. It's possible that the money has been found by customers a few times, but I like to imagine that always makes its way to the worker.
The look on her face when she found a fiver is something I'd have to imagine, but man, did I get her.  2-1, muchacha. AntiAtavist wins.

I live with my boyfriend and his parents. His parents both lost their job and moved in with us 900 miles from all of my family and friends. I didn't want them to come, but my boyfriend would always say ""free daycare, free daycare"" meaning his mom could help with our daughter. Well, it never worked out that way. I ask her to help most of the time and she is playing a video game. Same with his dad. 

I was sitting on the couch crying because my boyfriend was working really late, asking him when he would be home while my daughter screamed in my ear. His mom was doing laundry and said ""let me know when the dryer is done"" and walked away to take a nap. I was livid. She works part time, his dad is still unemployed, and they have yet to help us pay a single bill. 

When I finally got my daughter to sleep, I waited for the dryer to finish.

When we arrived at Enterprise, the man jockeyed for position to get in front of me, clearly wanting to get his car first. We've all done that sort of thing - but what made this a dick move is he not only physically bumped me, but he rushed off the shuttle leaving his young daughters to gather all the luggage while he held his position.  

I casually picked up my bag, helped his daughters with theirs (and his), and walked into Enterprise. There was one person being helped, and Must-be-next man was next. 

But what he did not plan for when he shouldered me and abandoned his daughters to save 5 minutes, is how often I travel. In many locations, Enterprise has a separate line for corporate customers. And I am a corporate customer.

I walked right over to my special line as the customer at the desk finished. The clerk motioned me over instead of the pushy asshole, and he had to wait while I rented my car.

infinus5,14,51,1oasfv,49,"this happened about a  year ago i believe, during last years fishing guiding season in canada's northwest.

my dad guides for some really well respected and wealthy individuals in the town of Smithers BC. 
i work for my dad as a guide had when were going to have more than one client, usually these sorts of trips are rather fun and not all that hard. i pick up some old guys bag, load it in the helicopter, get free lunch and get to explore while the rest of the groups in the middle of the river. 

well this two weeks was horrible. i was going to be the slave to one of the clients sons, a scummy, stupid, ingrate that treats everyone below him like dirt. lets call him Jake.
id had to help this guy around for the past to seasons and really thought it would have been better for my sanity to just disappear into the wilderness and walk home instead of dealing with Jake. 

so the group arrives at the air port, all kitted out for two weeks in the middle of nowhere. i gather up the dads gear, have a short conversation on how the season was going and load everything into the chartered helicopter. 

we headed out to the camp, 45 km from the nearest town by river and got everything set up all the while getting berated by Jake, who as usual was not doing anything other than complain about phone service and the the fact that we don t have internet.

for the next two days we headed up the skeena and a couple other rivers, not getting much other than mosquito bites. while my dad and the client went further up stream i was told to ""look after"" the clients son. 

now to revenge. i told him that his dad wanted to see him up river (they went down stream) and made that asshole walk 10 km before getting a radio message to head back. all this time Jake was falling in the river, swearing, crying, saying that he would have me arrested for kidnapping him. 

than this is where it gets really good. a couple days later a helicopter arrives in camp. i didn't think of it much as cargo choppers often stopped off at the air pad for deliveries. 

as i walked out to great the pilot a young brunette woman in a shiny winter coat almost falls out of the helicopter. i go over to help her out and realize it was Terry, the clients daughter. ok, i thought, things are looking up in the world. 

Terry's one of the prettiest girls i ll ever meet, her attitude brightens up anywhere she goes, and as an added bonus she is really smart. unfortunately i hadn't had much alone time with her before as she usually just took the connecting flight from Smithers to her moms family in Terrace. 

Terry doesn't get out often into the wilderness, and really didn't know what to do with her self. 
than i got the most amazing news, i was going to be Terry's guide while she was in camp for the rest of the week. best way to get back at her brother.

her brother went livid, the thought of his worst enemy pulling body guard duty for his sister almost made him pop a vain. 

so for that week i showed Terry the mountains around camp, we went out further and further each day, exploring the vastness that is northern bc. we camped out on our own at the red rose mine, i showed her the basics of living outdoors and we had the time of our lives. that had to have been one of the best couple weeks in my 19 years on earth. 

so in summery, i got the girl, pissed off her brother, didn't have to do much hard work and all without alerting my dad or the client.

“Sir! Excuse me! Sir!” I attempted to ignore her, but there weren’t enough people around to pretend she was talking to somebody else.  “Yes, what is it?”

“Is your electric bill ever over $100/month?”

“Nope, never.”  

Her look of disbelief was matched by her incredulous tone. “Yeah, right.  Sure it is.”

Now at this point I was distracted by the simultaneous effort of trying to check out and carrying on the conversation with my daughter, that I was merely trying to deflect the sales bitch long enough to get out of there. But something in her tone made me take a pause.  I turned to face her, giving her all my attention.

“Actually, my bill averages around $55 per month.  You see, we recently converted our household lighting to LED, and that made a solar conversion impractical.”

At this point, the store was becoming busier, and some other potential targets walked by her table.  She immediately adopted a dismissive tone.  “That’s great, sir. Thank you.” As she turned away from me to talk to other customers, I persisted.

“When I ran a cost comparison…” A few more customers walked by. “That’s great, sir. Thank you.”

“Solar would cost almost twice as much…”  And a few more lost sales. “That’s great, sir. Thank you.”

“So my family decided LED conversion was a much better…”  Yet a few more lost sales. “That’s great, sir. Thank you.”

We carried on like this for another few minutes until my daughter had had enough.  Hopefully she lost at least one commission!

I was a Resident Assistant (RA) at a dorm. We were a different type of dorm on campus (that no longer exists at the campus) as we were self sustained; we (the 30 or so up us) had a full kitchen in our basement, had a dumbwaiter to move the food up for meals, ordered our own food from distributors, etc.


We would plan dinners, have cooking, cleaning and bussing shifts. Overall, it was a nice setup, and as long as we kept our budget in mind, we'd have some pretty spectacular treats and dinners ( Lobster dinners, fresh berries in the winter, fries, onion rings and chicken nuggets on hand 24/7 to cook in the fryer).


As you may infer, this was mainly a granola-ey, tree hugging group. The dorm mates were, overall, a great bunch. Building and campus rules allowed those of legal age to drink - and brew - beer.
I was a pretty lax RA; if they wanted to drink, so be it. I helped those of age brew beer, and got beverages in return. Those under age that wanted to imbibe generally had a blind eye turned unless they brought undue attention to themselves. As long as they were circumspect, I let it slide.


Cue one malfeasant. As others were hanging out, cooking various items in the kitchen, I noticed that he would disappear into the pantry on a regular basis, only to reemerge a few seconds later. This routine happened enough for me to become suspicious. I nonchalantly entered the pantry, to discover he had a beer that he was hiding from me. I was not a happy camper, and quickly formulated a plan.  As this was a pantry, we had all sorts of sundries on hand - including Tabasco. His beer suddenly was spiked with half a bottle of the seasoning.


The next time he went for a sip of his hidden beverage, coughing, sputtering, spitting and swearing emerged from the pantry. As he was under age, there was little he could do to complain to higher ups, and his mates could only say, ""He warned you not to hide it...""

croppedcross3,30,70,1o6umq,315,"Little bit of background before I begin. I'm a laborer foreman for a relatively large construction company. We do subwork for an electric company. Essentially, our job is to dig ditches. We use union operators to run the equipment, but the laborers are non union. 

**Story #1**

The jobsite we are on is rather large, so we use buggies to get around. Similar to [this] (http://www.perhire.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/workmax.png). One electrical foreman, we'll call him dickhead (or DH), completely earns that title. He's grumpy every day, always sarcastic, and does his best to make everyone feel like a complete dumbass. So, whenever possible I park my buggy just close enough to his so that he has to do at least a three point turn to leave. The extra ten seconds of his life I cost make me smile every time.

**Story #2**

As I mentioned, our operators are union. We are not. I don't want to get into a union/nonunion debate, but some of the operators act entitled. They insist on rides to and from their machines every day, but they refuse to drive themselves. I've received calls several times to haul an operator to a porta-potty within 100 yards of him. One operator in particular, let's call him Chad, refuses to set foot out of his machine unless it's onto a buggy. It drives my boss nuts too, but Chad is an excellent operator so he puts up with it. 

One day, Chad is working in the middle of the woods behind the job site. It's getting close to quitting time, and he calls demanding a ride. I tell him if he can just wait a minute I'll be back to get him, and immediately get the response ""fuck those laborers, come get me first you little shit!"".  

Fuck. That. 

I don't say anything back and just hang up. I tell all my guys to ignore any calls from Chad, and we all head home. My boss calls me later that night laughing his ass off. Instead of simply walking to the gate (roughly a fifteen minute walk), Chad decides to wait until someone comes to get him. By the time he realizes no one is coming, it's too late. The gates automatically lock after a certain amount of time and you have to call security to get out. He was stuck there for two extra hours waiting on clearance to get out. Since then all my calls from him have been most cordial.

**Story #3**

As I said, we dig ditches. When it rains, dirt turns to mud, so I wear rubber boots. By the end of the day they will be completely covered in dirt. One day I stop at a gas station on my way home, and considerate guy that I am, I take off my boots. This way, my socks are clean, so they won't have to mop after I leave. I do this most days, never have any issues. As soon as I make it through the door the new cashier says ""Nuh uh, got's ta have shoes on ta be in hyere"". I just look at her, turn around and leave.

After putting my boots on, dragging my feet through the flower bed, and stepping in a mud puddle, I make my grand reappearance. Clumps of dirt, drops of water, and looks of horror from the cashier were my companions on that walk. Every step (low step, as to shuffle my feet across the floor) was magnificent. A blind man could have followed my path through that store. It was amazing.

So many years back our neighbors built a fence. (I'm in elementary school at the time.) My parents decided to check it out to make sure it was in the right location, etc. Turns out the fence is on our property. They ask them to move it and they refuse. My parents contact a lawyer friend of theirs to make them move it.

The neighbor's lawyer sends my parents and their lawyer a copy of the map of the properties in question. Our lawyer checks it out, says it looks good. (For those who are wondering, our property is roughly an acre and a half, and you can't just see the line.) Then, my mother, who has her law degree, just never took the bar, takes a closer look at it and compares it to our own map from when we bought the house. Turns out that they moved the property line so that they were, in effect, stealing our land to place the fence. They still deny this to this day.

This lawyer friend wasn't well learned in this area, and my parents couldn't afford litigation. They wound up bluffing their way into getting the neighbors to pay 10k for the land. Then, they had a surveyor mark the line. They still live there and occasionally I chuck various dirty items over the fence when no one's looking.

I returned home one day after having run to the store to find a strange car in my assigned space. I went to the Manager's Office to report them, and the manager, an older woman in her 60s, apologized profusely for the inconvenience. 

She excitedly gave me two of these giant stickers (5"" x 8"") http://i.imgur.com/TPR7DuY.gif to put on the car's windows, and told me to make sure to stick them down really well, as they are a BITCH to remove. They will not peel off cleanly, ever. She also hand wrote in red Sharpie an angry note for me to leave on the windshield too.

I took great joy in putting one of the stickers over the driver side window and the other one right on the windshield where it would most obscure the driver's view.

RabbitsRuse,12,36,1o5zvw,19,"So as you may be able to guess, this is a story my dad told me years ago that always made me laugh. Back when my dad was in college he was living in an apartment building. The building had four levels of apartments with three stories above ground and then a basement level of apartments. 

My dad and his roommates would sometimes go the the field outside of the gated area around the apartment to play Frisbee. The apartment allowed pets and the woman who lived by the stairs in the basement level of the apartment had a dog. Somehow this dog always knew when my dad and his friends were outside playing Frisbee and it had no problem getting out of the apartment through the doggy door and squeezing through the bars of the fence going around the building to play with them. Unfortunately the dog's favorite game was to steel my dads Frisbee and play keep away until it could chew it up. I don't know if they ever went to confront the woman about her dog before they came up with the plan but it kept happening and they were getting pissed about this dog. 

Finally they decide to teach the dog a lesson. They all knew that the dog loved tennis balls just as much as Frisbees so the next time they went out they took a tennis ball with them... plus a large new bottle of Tabasco sauce. They threw the ball a few times and sure enough the dog comes running. They then completely doused the ball in Tabasco until it was completely red and threw it for the dog. The dog snatches the ball and starts to play it's game of keep away when suddenly it drops the ball and stands there barking at it. They walk over and pick the ball back up and douse it again before throwing it for the dog. Again the dog takes off after the ball, picks it up, drops it and starts barking at it unable to figure it out. My dad and his friends, being college guys, are laughing hysterically by now and keep repeating the cycle. By the time they call it a day they have literally used about half of the large bottle of Tabasco. 

Everyone goes to bed that night thinking that they have had their fun and that it is all over, but of course it wasn't. Sometime that night the Tabasco finished running it's course through the dog's digestive track and it really had to go. Something interesting about dogs that you may or may not know is that they will do anything in their power to not poop where they sleep. The dog left the basement apartment and made it's way up the stairs. One feature of the building that is important to this story is that the stairs connecting each level of the building went up along the outside of the building but there was in fact about an inch wide gap between the staircase and the wall they ran parallel to. 

The dog made it all the way up the the third floor of the building before it decided that it had gone far enough an turned it's back end to the wall of the building. If you have guessed watery diarrhea at this point then you are correct and because of the gap between the stairs and the outside wall of the building it ran all the way down the side of the building and puddled outside of the woman's apartment. The next day my dad woke up to the sound of the woman shouting at the poor dog and felt really guilty about everything. Not enough to confess about it though so the woman had to clean it off the side of every floor of the building. I guess she should have trained the dog to be better behaved.

ajaxmusik,17,57,1o5vs3,109,"Let me preface this by saying that I understand what it's like when someone shows up to your store as you're closing. It sucks and I try and not do it. Ever. If I absolutely must, I will be understanding and gtfo as fast as humanly possible. 

Last Friday I was in the mood for some soup. Not just any soup. Vietnamese Pho soup. Delicious stuff. In all modesty, I make the shit out of this soup. The Vietnamese are like: ""whoa, that's some good soup"". I check out my supplies at home and I'm missing a few things. ""Off to the vegetable depository!"" I proclaim.

I arrive at the local haberdashery, list in hand. A quick in &amp; out trip. This store is anything but large and even a sizable grocery order wouldn't take more than 10 minutes in this place. I'm greeted by a large gentleman who we'll call ""Mr. Happy"". Mr. Happy was anything but happy. As I walked up to the door, Mr. Happy greets me with arms crossed and a ""how dare you enter our establishment"" look. I pull out my phone to double check the time and sure enough, 6:45. 

I say to Mr. Happy ""Oh good, you're still open!"" to which he grunts. As I approach the vegetables, they're tarped off and the lights are off on the refrigerators. ""No problem"" I think. This is not my first time at this particular vegetable rodeo, so I know exactly where everything is. This will be a breeze. 

I carefully brush aside where the green onions are. Here's where Mr. Happy cranks up the 'tude knob. Lets out a huge sigh and rips all of the tarps down. Sorry buddy, the 'tude isnt needed. Here's where I turn from understanding to notgivingafucking. 

I ask if they sell green onions. A loud sigh emerges, and instead of pointing to the green onions, he picks up a bunch and places them in my basket. Apparently I can't pick out my own vegetables now. As i realize that my patience is no longer merited for Mr. Happy, I pick the green onions out of my basket and inspect them. I say ""sorry these one's won't do, I'd like those ones"". Another sigh worthy of a steamship, he hands me the next bunch to inspect. ""These are PERFECT. Thank you. Do you sell ginger?"" Same thing. The steamship sounds and he plops an offensively large sized piece of ginger root. ""I'm sorry, that's far too big"" I say. Steamship. I get him to snap off an inch-sized piece. ""Do you sell onions?"" A grunt and a point. ""Thank you!"" At this point I'm looking for the best onion I can find. I generally don't care about my onions this much, but today, I'm finding a Lao Tzu Pearl of an onion. I find it after 30-40 seconds of inspecting every onion they had. 

I saunter over to the cash register, pay for my $4 worth of vegetables, and thank Mr. Happy for his time. I leave feeling gratified and think to myself: Good. I wasted an extra 2-3 minutes of his life because he thought he could ""speed things up"" by being a total wad. Suck it.

Pee-Venge,26,45,1o5rky,227,"A few years ago when I was still in college I lived in a huge party house with 8 of my friends. The year started off good but quickly took a turn for south, mainly due to bills and the fact that every one was broke.

Seeing as every one did not have that much money, it was a common occurrence for my food to be eaten out of the fridge. (Problem 1) Living with 8 other people made it very difficult to catch whoever had been doing it... For all I know it was probably more than 1 person, so my solution was buying a mini fridge for my room. Problem basically solved, end of story.

Once I fixed the issue with vanishing food, I started noticing that my shampoo and body wash were being used... ALOT to the point where a family sized bottle of shampoo was gone within a month. Of course I brought it to every ones attention (more than once) but it still kept happening. Now this really bothered me, because a bottle of shampoo and soap together costs about 10 dollars and should last most people well over a month. So this time I set out on revenge.

I went and purchased new shampoo and body wash for myself which I started keeping in my room and would only bring it out when I was showering. As for the other half used bottles in the bathroom... well... I did the only logical thing at the time... and that was to piss in them, this wasn't any normal piss either, it was the morning after binge drinking, dehydrated dark ass yellow piss... I then shook both of the bottles up really good, just to make sure they mixed in nicely and that it wasn't obvious they had been tampered with.
I guess no one noticed because over the next few weeks I got a nice laugh every morning as the bottles continued to get lower and lower until they were eventually used up.

Aarcn,17,19,1o5gn8,83,"Background: I grew up in S.E Asia and attended international school. Our school had a Boy Scouts program that pretty much every kid was apart of.

In third grade we had a kid who's parents would travel a lot and would get all the cool newest legos overseas we will call him M. He would bring in his awesome new toys (I.e: Ice Planet Lego sets and brag about em, this stuff was hard to find in South East Asia). He was kind of a prick, but his parents always had the best birthday parties so people kinda tolerated him. Cartman from South Park always kinda reminded me of an extreme version of this kid.

One day during recess he left his toys out, my friend and I decided to play with them. M comes in sees us, starts screaming and runs out to tell the teacher we tried stealing from him. We got in trouble got sent to principles office etc.
A couple of months later we go on a camping trip. We went hiking so people were pretty tired. Me and my friend were in the same tent and his mom had packed him bananas. We accidentally step on one and laugh saying eeew it looks like poo poo. Then suddenly we both start scheming. M had gone to bed early because he was a bit husky and the hike took a toll on him.

We could hear him snoring in his tent so we knew he was asleep. In the middle of the night we mushed up a banana and mixed in random stuff to make it look like poo (dirt), snuck in his tent and put it in his pants. We had learned how people decorated cakes a couple weeks prior so we had our mixture in a ziplock bag, we cut off the a corner and squeezed it into his pants. I remember this mixture just oozing out looking like the grossest thing ever... It even smelled kinda nasty. Keep in mind this is near the equator where the weather is tropical moist and warm... Food goes bad quickly. We then threw the evidence into a fire (I know burning plastic is horrible) and went to bed.

Next morning we all woke up and realized M wasn't at breakfast. The adults were trying to get him to come out but he wouldn't. Finally one of them goes in and we hear him crying saying hes not a ""baby"". we weren't sure what happened after because the adults separated the rest of the kids but we are convinced until this day he probably thinks he shit his pants.",Accuse me of stealing your toys?

The owners of the restaurant were new to this kind of financial venture and weren't really sure how to run things. Even though it's best to have guidance from someone who knows the business, they had an invisible partner who was a notorious cheapskate and was constantly belittling the owners.

The place unfortunately opened during the recession and the winter so it wasn't that popular to begin with, but the invisible partner had persuaded the owners to cut their losses and sell.

Let's call him Thug.

Thug had been held back numerous times, and was therefore much larger than all the other students. He also often participated in lunchtime sports, which meant he often came to class covered in sweat. He was generally rude and unpleasant to everyone, and had a habit of using his size to bully people.

On one of those days, he had brought his gym shorts to class with him, and was amusing himself by throwing them at the various people quietly working on their assignments. (Because it was a quiet work period, the teacher was not paying attention.)

I was sitting next to my musically inclined friend, whom we shall call Metalbro.

Thug threw his sweaty shorts at Metalbro, landing them in such a way that they wrapped around his head. This made Metalbro angry, and he turned around to confront Thug. Knowing that yelling at Thug would only make him happy and get Metalbro in trouble, I held up a hand to calm him down.

I then took Thug's shorts, and instead of throwing them back to him in disgust like everyone else had so far, I threw them further towards the front of the class, landing them squarely in the middle of a group of cheerleader-types.

*They* had no problem with turning and screaming across the room at Thug, finally drawing the attention of the Teacher. Looking like a deer caught in the headlights, Thug tried to tell them that I had been the one to throw his shorts at them.

*Incident &amp; Revenge:* When I was about 10, my family went to stay with the grandparents for a weekend.  I invited my friend Jay to travel with us beforehand, so he came along for the ride.  Jay was nice most of the time but he had a mischievous streak that usually only came out when we played board games together.  One night however, we had just finished dinner and were about to run off and play, when Jay said, ""did you eat your vitamins?""  My mom perked up and gave them to my sister and me to eat, much to my dismay.  Jay knew I had grown to hate these vitamins, and smirked while this happened.

Now I was mad so I formulated a plan.  Jay had brought along a large bag of Lays potato chips along for the trip - the regular kind.  He loved his regular Lays, but he hated Salt &amp; Vinegar flavor, and I just happened to have some with my foodstuffs.  When he went to go use the bathroom, I took what was in my nearly-empty Salt &amp; Vinegar bag and dumped it into the top of his almost-full regular Lays bag.  A few minutes later after Jay came out of the bathroom, he reached into his chip bag, put some in his mouth, and spit them out everywhere.  It was great.",Make me eat my gross vitamins?

shesmyginger,73,76,1o2uuy,363,"Text wall. Sorry in advance.

Backstory: I live in a three-bedroom apartment and had three roommates. One is my gf, one of her co-workers (K), and another friend (A). Everything was fine until K starts letting two of his friends (J &amp; P) start staying here. Everyone works and I make about 2x the amount of everyone else in the apartment. We had an apartment meeting between the four of us that originally lived in the apartment and it was voted 3 to 1 (me opposing) to allow the other two people to move in. Pros = rent lower per person. Cons = everything in the apartment (furniture, cookware, decorations) except K's TV, belongs to either myself or my gf. I didn't know these guys before this. One of them works for a temp company, or I should say temporarily works for the temp company (he's lazy and won't call to see if they have work for him, maybe works 1 or 2 days a week.

The incident(s): So many things quickly started going wrong from the moment the other guys moved in. They hosted an impromptu party in which 20+ people showed up. Many of which we didn't know, resulting in the theft of several of my DVDs, 360 games, and $180 dollars stolen from my room and one guy spent the night puking on a blanket that was handmade for me by a close friend that had passed away. They ate $418.00 worth of me and my gf's groceries in like three days. The apartment was always trashed, dishes piled up, stove/kitchen left uncleaned. Getting people to give their share of the electric/cable/internet bills on time was like pulling teeth without Novocain. They broke the armrest off the side of my brand new couch, shorted out my TV, broke the tray off my printer, and destroyed my recliner. The list goes on and on. After four months and a lot of irritation I finally took some satisfaction from being a complete dick back. 

The Revenge: First thing I did was remove my water filter from the kitchen sink. They all are avid water drinkers when they aren't drinking alcohol and now are forced to drink our really shitty tap water. Two, I buy groceries one day at a time and tend to make things like steak, bbq chicken, etc, but only enough to feed me and my gf and then enjoy eating in front of them while they dine on their Ramen. Three I just quit asking for their parts of the wifi bill, and I changed the network name to something like ""sucksyoudon'thavewifi"", as well as the password and didn't even give it to my gf (just put it in her phone/laptop for her). Only me and my gf have phones that have service, the rest were using the wifi on their's with apps that work of wifi or Facebook. Now they have to all leave the apartment and walk over to the grocery store or down to McD's or one of the other restaurants to have wifi, allowing us to have the apartment to ourselves for long periods of time in the evenings.

so0ks,11,14,1o2kin,46,"In one of my classes, there's this chick that on the first day threw the biggest bitch fit about how I wasn't actually assigned to the group. Everybody, professor included gave zero fucks. She's like this trust fund yuppie; has the latest iPhone 5 whatever champagnah, Windows 8 tablet computer, designer clothes and shoes that I can't pronounce. The works.

Well, this girl decides not to participate in said group for a project we presented today at the beginning of the semester. She gave us a bad email to start, then her new email worked, but she wouldn't email us back... yada yada. Just no contact. Our first twenty classes, she showed up to four. My university has a policy that you can only miss two classes without a valid excuse before the professor has the option to fail you; the prof actually asked middle of the class where she has been when handing back papers. Each time she actually showed, she'd look at us and bolt out the door as soon as class ended. One of the other girls in our group has her in another class the same fucking days, and she shows up to that one consistently, but of course avoids all eye contact.

We complained and told our professor all of the issues with her, and considering her attendance, he promised not to dock us because of her. We just have to keep him updated. The professor must have said something to her about her class and group participation, because suddenly, she starts to care about her grade last week. We give her a few things to do, and she didn't get back to any of us until late last night. Project is due today, I didn't see her email before going to bed, so this morning I start trying to slap together shit because of her, and I realize she didn't do her portion at all. She sent me *shit we already did*.

Whatever. It's too late, I email the professor the project, explain who did what, and that she just redid a portion that we already did and was turned in previously. Each time something was first, she'd miraculously show up to class, and I'd only let her out her name down after everybody else, which irked her.

We go up to present, and she's looking all smug, telling us that she had this and that and blah. The sour look on her face was worth it when she saw that I put her name, once again, dead last on the PowerPoint.

Wellhowboutdat,176,614,1o24k0,1481,"Ok. So one thing that seems to be reaching epidemic proportions in my town is the number of bags people (mostly women for some reason) seem to bring with them on their daily commute.

Enter Bag Lady (BL) who had a gym bag, a purse, a bag full of what seemed to be numerous pairs of shoes, a plastic bag with newspapers and reading materials, a bag with what appeared to be her lunch. 5 bags, one professionally dressed woman. Seems excessive but whatever.

BL decides to stand on the train in front of the doors. Now this bugs me when anyone does it, never mind this urban sherpa.  So as people are exiting her bags are getting bumped and she's getting a head of steam on. She starts telling people to watch out and gets pretty belligerent with a few passengers. Someone tells her to move out of the doorway and her response was ""I was here first.""  WTF BL are you 12 or something?

Anyway my turn to exit is coming up so I position myself so I'm last to get off. I time it so the doors are just starting to close as I exit and as I do I pinch the nearest plastic bag and drag it out the door with me. The doors close and I hit it perfect. The portion stuck in the door was thin enough that it didn't set off the auto-open and as I watched the train pull away all I saw was an undulating plastic bag slamming against the outside of the door slowly leaking papers everywhere.

Itkovan,4,14,1o1i6t,68,"Took my kids to a toy store.  Wife was shopping and I was on kid duty.  Took them to the train tables where another little girl was playing.  Everything was fine but the kids couldn't get between the tables so I scooted them apart a little.  The other girl left and my two kids were merrily playing away (for quite a while.)


Cue this little shitstorm of a kid in a red and black jacket.  He barrels on over and starts throwing trains everywhere and smacking various parts of the nailed-down sets.  Finally he decides on a train and starts it roughly hurtling around the track.  He comes to my just-learned-to-walk kid and start shoving her over - I was right there and grabbed her, forming a barrier with my arm, and let her walk to another location on her own.  I would have preferred to block him off and let **him** go around, but his push had already set her in motion and we both just went with it.  


So then I get the younger one over to the other table, and this little fucker starts heading towards my other kid.  Who is closer to his age but not quite as old.  Just then my wife got back and said she was heading to checkout.  Sounded like good timing to me.  The elder kid started heading out the other way just after shithead's arm extended, narrowly making contact.  


I'm thinking, fuck this little bastard!  But what am I going to do?  He is just a kid, after all.  My own kids are running/toddling off and the opportunity is closing - I realize, *hey, that's not the way I found the tables*.  So I reach out and close the tables together again, leaving them just the way I found them.


Since the tracks go around each table entirely, this would definitely block him the next time around.  I waited 10 steps or so and glanced back - this little kid was holding his train just in front of the closed section and staring at the closed tables like ""wtf? How did this happen?""

Well, my friend has decided that the ""whole institution"" needed to be punished, and that includes me because I didn't quit school the second the scandal broke, and because I stayed after everything was said and done. He has been very mean to me regarding my education, and that I should be ""grateful"" that I'm still able to get my education. I'd be less pissed if he could let it go after the 2 years, but he brings it up if I even so mention that I'm in class, even on facebook.

So, he was selling something my husband collects. The item he's was selling is worth around $350-400. He'd done absolutely no research on the item, because I think he trusts me to tell him if it's a fair price since my husband collects them. He priced it at about $100.

Well, my husband bought it. And I'm not going to tell him that my husband turned around and has a buyer for it for $250 more than he paid for it.

texx77,20,58,1o1hls,205,"My senior year of college was great, I lived in a house with my three best friends and we never had any issues.  Then we all graduated and kinda went our separate ways, except for myself and one of the guys, I'll call Nick.  We ended up both moving to the same city.  How cool right?

I didn't know many people in town except him, but he did; partly because he grew up around the area and partly because of his work (he was a liquor distributor.  An element of his job being - go out and ""promote"" (aka party) his brands.  Since I don't know anyone else, I basically only call him to hang out on the weekends.  Eventually he started blowing me off, not returning texts or calls, and I had no idea why.  

A few days later I see he commented on one of my friends status' on facebook, and I made some half-joking reply ""Oh you can go on fb but not call me back??"".  He ends up replying to that comment a few hours later and COMPLETELY goes off on me (again no idea why, I had done nothing to him), calling me a loser, that I have no friends and I rely on him for a social life, etc, etc. Completely blown out of proportion.

Now at this point I will mention that in college he had an issue with addictive drugs, ending up going to rehab, and was clean for quite some time after, but when we moved to this new city I saw him start casually using again and slowly started ramping up, but I'm not one to judge so I didn't say anything.  So I never responded to that comment and I never called or texted him after that (Call it pride, a grudge, I don't know) and that was about 9 months ago.  I lost one of my best friends and I still don't know why.

Anyway, a few days ago I got in contact with the other two guys from my college house and informed them I was going to Vegas this year in February and I wanted them to come.  They accepted and we began to make plans.

Fast forward to today and Nick messages me on facebook, basically saying he didn't know why we stopped talking and he thought we were friends, how I'm a bad friend for never calling him anymore and that he had talked to the other guys about our plans and was wondering if he could join us. 

Oh yes.  Here is my exact response to him:

sanfrustration,11,17,1o1den,55,"I wanted to wait a bit to tell this story, but I think enough time has passed and I doubt this clown will put 2 and 2 together... even if he happens to read this post.  Not too long ago I lived in an apartment in San Francisco that had tandem parking.  For those unfamiliar, this a cramped garage that parks cars not side by side, but front and back.  What this means is that if both cars are in the garage at the same time, one of the cars is going to be blocking the other from being able to leave the garage.

For a while I had a great setup.  My tandem neighbor was nice and considerate, and didn't use his car much.  We gave each other our spare keys, and moved each others' cars if they were ever blocking us.  Then sadly and suddenly, this kind soul took a job out of state and moved out while the most selfish, self-absorbed prick moved in and became my new tandem parking neighbor.

I won't get into the finer details, but let's just say that this ass hat went through 4 cars during our time parking together.  This was a problem because he didn't always have a spare key, and would promise to leave his only key on the front tire, only to later forget and box me in.  He ran into my car a few times scratching my bumper, and twice left something on in my car after he moved it, resulting in a dead battery... once when I found out right before I had to leave to drive to a job interview.

When I called him out on that and tried to force him to pay for my cab fare, he put up quite a fuss and refused to pay me at first.  At this point, I was fed up and decided to seek justice commiserate with what this prick deserved.

I had lived in CA for some time, and many years ago I somehow figured out I had an immunity to Poison Oak.  This is the Poison Ivy of the West Coast, and is a common plant/weed in the state.  It leaves a very nasty rash for most that come into contact with it, and the oil can lie dormant for months before coming in contact with somebody and causing them to blister.  

So after the job interview debacle (I was so hurried and flustered I wound up bombing it), I decided to get some Poison Oak and rub it all over his steering wheel, console and stick shift.  It wasn't a very well thought out plan, but I did manage to quickly find a plant and since I had the spare key to his car at the time, the whole impulsive bout of revenge took a little over an hour from start to finish.

It felt good at the time, and I had completely forgotten about it until about 2 weeks later when I bumped into him in the hallway of our building.  His face was all scratched up and blistered, and was shiny from some sort of ointment he put must have recently put on it.  I didn't like the guy, so I didn't even bother to ask what happened, but I'm almost certain he must have noticed the twinkle in my eye as he dejectedly shuffled past me.","A tale of city living, tandem parking and poison oak",72

Callanson,9,22,1nzsqs,141,"The apartment I live in shares a small parking lot with two other buildings. There is a narrow driveway with parking spaces along the sides running between my building and the neighboring building, widening out in back with the third building along the back edge. This building only has street access through the driveway. All the buildings are owned by different landlords, but luckily my neighbors are all nice and stick to their assigned spots. My spot is the last spot along the side of the building before the lot widens out, and is the only one perpendicular to the building, rather than parallel. As such, my spot is a bit of a choke point, and I am always very careful to make sure I am not sticking out and blocking the driveway.

The family who lives in the back building has a young son who takes the bus to school. The city I live in doesn't use regular buses, but sticks a ""school bus"" sign on top of a van, and requires the busses to pick up students from their door.  Unfortunately, this bus is driven by an absolute shrew of a woman. Every morning, right as I am leaving from work, she blasts down the driveway, screeches to a halt, and leans on the horn until the kid shows up. Most mornings she's waiting as I walk to my car, so I always wave, and if her window is down say good morning. I have never gotten anything but the most baleful of glares in return. Even a surly grunt of acknowledgement would be an improvement. 

Last week, I hear her pull up as I'm tying my shoes. Much to my surprise, instead of honking I hear the door open and slam shut again. Thinking the kid was on time for once, I am surprised to see her still sitting there when I go to my car.  Even more surprising, I find she's left one of those obnoxious, snarky ""bad parking job"" cards under my windshield wiper. She gives me an extra spiteful glare as I pull it off. I was parked fine, there was less than an inch between my bumper and the building, and if I was crooked you would have needed a protractor to tell, but whatever. She's always surly, and not worthy of my attention. 

After I got home from work, I ran into my upstairs neighbors and much to my surprise find out that she has left those cards on everybody's car, including cars that are nowhere near the driveway. This pisses me off, as this lady is obviously a busybody looking for reasons to be annoyed at other's parking, and has appointed herself the queen of the Parking Judgement Bureau.

By the time any of my neighbors need to get out, I've already left, so the only person inconvenienced is the bus lady. I've got quite a collection of those cards now, and every time I see the bus lady fuming at me as I remove another card and give a cheery wave warms my heart.

I'm about 6'7'' so even when I'm just trying to be friendly (i.e. not farting on a stanger kid's head) and meeting a family member's or friend's kid for the first time, I've noticed they get very 'hide between their mother's legs' intimidated on sight if I'm not sitting down. So it's not hard for me to silence/intimidate a child, especially when I'm trying to.

However, a few times I've been called out. One time I was pretty drunk with a friend at a Target buying Risk (and no, we never finished playing the whole game). This little mexican 5-7 year old with a mohawk, was being an insufferable little shit in the action figure section. I heard him from like 5 aisles over and it was like nails on a chalkboard. I tell my friend, ""I'm gonna fart on this kids head. Watch and learn.""

I saunter on over to the aisle in question and see the vile little prick calling his mom an ""idiot"" for not buying him a huge fucking G.I. JOE The Movie vehicle (which pissed me off even more considering how awful that movie was. BUY SOME GOOD TOYS!) ""I already bought that one for you and you broke it by throwing it down the stairs"" ""SHUT UP. I NEED IT. IT'S THE ONLY ONE I DON'T HAVE NOW."" The mother was younger than me (I'm mid twenties) and gave a defeated look, ""I don't have enough money right now."" ""YOU ARE AN IDIOT,"" and continued to just berate and publicly shame this woman.

At the time, I was on a strict Chipotle carnitas burrito diet. And while I was watching all this, my stomach gave me an initial warning gurgle (very courteous stomach) telling me I was about an hour away from punishing the toilet. Serendipity! Destiny!

I inch a bit closer to my prey, inspecting some wrestling toys and pondering the weird homoeroticness of the whole 'sport' in general. The kid shouts ""FUCK YOU, I HATE YOU!"" The mom rolls her eyes and turns her back to the kid to ignore him. And could you believe it, the kid gets on his hands and knees and starts taking the toy out of the box. It's go time, motherfucker.

I position my back towards him and at this point am like 2 feet away from him. His head is down, getting frustrated with those god damn twisty tie things, and I go for the kill. I bend down to reach for the one of the toys on the lower shelf. At this point, my ass is INCHES away from this kids head.

Now, generally speaking, the best way to go about this is to act casual, drop your belly bomb, then walk away after a few seconds like nothing is out of the ordinary. I usually go one aisle over and listen to the kid's reaction in delight. However, today I couldn't help myself. I have my head tilted back looking at this kid out of the corner of my eye, to ensure accuracy.

I'm so close that from a distance it looks like I'm about to sit on him,. My friend sees this happening and can no longer contain himself. He's covering his mouth, but his 'hee-haw' hyperventilating donkey chortle is fairly audible over the late 90's pop muzak playing on the loudspeakers.

The kid immediately looks up towards the laughter, but can't help but notice there is an ass now directly in his face. Now, I'm trying not to laugh but also panicking as I just made eye contact with him. He furls his brow and I look over in the mother's direction, still back towards us. I relish in the moment and the look on this child's confused and naive face.

The initial blast was mighty and boisterous. I swear I saw his hair blowing in the wind (so to speak). If I wasn't wearing jeans, I think it could have probably blown over an empty soda can. I would call it ""a very fun fart"" (A++ would buy again). However, what immediately followed that out the chamber was truly horrifying. The fart's implication changed without notice and swiftly. It went from a joyous, dry airhorn squeal to a nefarious, hissing mephitis. I think the little moppet noticed the hateful metamorphosis before even I did because he wretched his neck violently trying to get away from the personified evil being fumigated into his soul. Because of his positioning (hovering over the toy, hands and knee), it was all in vain as the only way out was forward...and forward would mean certain death. I had positioned myself well on the higher ground, free to escape or relent at any time and him, poor and immobilized: biding his time until the cruel attack was over. Obviously, this child needed to re-read Sun Tzu.

In total, it lasted about 4 seconds but for that kid, it must have seemed like time was frozen. The long-term severe brain damage which he no doubt suffered, only added to that effect.

When I finished with my bidness (i.e. forcing a little boy to huff my farts), there was a silent, pregnant pause. The kid was clearly shocked and stunned. No one had ever stood up to this dwarf sociopath in his whole life. I had taken the words out of his mouth and filled it with fart.

I make my move first, picking up the toy I was ""reaching for"" off the low shelf, take a few steps forward and stare at it for a few seconds. On '2 alligator,' the only thing the kid could manage to do was burst into tears. My friend senses danger 'the jig is up' and his head darts for cover. The mom turns around to see her kid with an open toy, crying on the floor and me minding my own business.

She walks up to him and asks what's wrong but the kid can't speak. All he gets out is, ""BAWAWAAAWAFARTBAWAWA."" It took every fiber in my body not to laugh. I put the toy back on a middle shelf, turn around, give a final nonchalant looksy and then begin to take my exit.

Sensing that his assailant was getting away scot-free, he somehow managed to compose himself for a moment. He shouts, ""HE FARTED ON ME!"" I could feel him pointing at me but I continued to act like I was just browsing. I was ALMOST around the corner when the mom goes:

""Excuse me....sir....SIR!""

I turn around nonplussed, ""Uh...who? Me?"" while pointing to myself.

""Yes. Did YOU just FART on my son?""

Weighing my options, I played dumb. ""What? I mean, I did fart.""

""On my son?""

""Well, I mean, technically speaking...I mean...what is 'on'?""

""Why did you fart on my son?""

At this point the little kid has the look of schadenfreude on his face, happy to see me in trouble. Fuck you, I'M A MAN! I WILL FART ON YOU IF I PLEASE! I turn my attention to the little kid and stare at him, ""Because the whole store could hear him being a little, rotten asshole to his mother so I thought I'd come over here and treat him like one.""

The mom looks at me, her son and the scattered GI JOE/wrappers/box on the floor. The mom is puzzled as to what to do and says, ""Just..just go."" That's my cue! I turn around, walk away with little extra step. I look up to see the black orb of security cameras and all the stories on reddit about unjustly having to register as a sex offender flash before my eyes. As soon as I turn the corner, I book it outside as fast as I can while dialing my friend. Like a true friend, he is right out front with the engine running and Risk in the trunk.

We laugh on the car ride back about the whole scene. With a slight hint of seriousness in his tone, my friend asks me:

""Do you do that a lot?""

""Ahhh, not that much. Like once every 6 months or so.""

We both knew I was lying. We got to our other friends house, played risk until 4 in the morning while drinking scotch. Overall, I would say it was a preeeetay preeeeetay good day.

Raveynfyre,10,32,1nzmh7,97,"So hubby and I go to the grocery store once a week. Our weekly trip is full of the usual, people who can’t park, forgetting coupons (**DAMNIT!**), assholes blocking the aisles with their carts while they’re talking with longtime friends/acquaintances/work friends/whatever’s and general public forms of douchebaggery.

As we finish up I notice one cashier lane with no line, and two who are helping customers. I assumed that the one empty lane was manned by someone who had briefly stepped away. For all I knew they were talking to their manager, so I try to give the benefit of the doubt. As we approached, no one seemed to take notice of us being in line. I look around and find that the cashier is standing at customer service, and definitely **not** talking about work. Gleeful cackling and comments about last nights party wafted in our direction. After standing in the lane long enough that the two other customers have finished their transactions and the people behind *them* were being rung up (the second customers not being there when we walked up to the lanes), I reached over and turned off her light.

As annoying as the whining was, I was more annoyed at the fact that she caved in.  So we had to listen to all of that for no reason.

smacksaw,11,28,1nyvwt,51,"Let it be known that I'm a pretty serious fan of The Cure.

In 1997, The Cure had a series of sporadic dates that weren't in support of any record, but were just them being nice and visiting the fans. Since these were often mini-festivals with general admission, you have to obviously stake your place and possibly listen to bands you don't care for. Like Everclear. Or Green Apple Quickstep.

I'm pretty good about getting front/centre and I did for this show. There was a metal barrier about 6' from the stage, security and then the elevated stage. It was a particularly raucous crowd as well and I had to absolutely use my size and strength to keep my position the entire show.

Once The Cure finally came on, something hits me in the back of the head and this guy falls on me. Crowdsurfer. Ok, fine. Security pulls him over the railing. Do they escort him out?

Well, 5 minutes later, same thing. Dude hits me again, except this time people are trying to pass him over. I'm pretty much having a WTF moment as to why he wasn't kicked out. I tell him to stop and I tell security to stop it. At the final pass I stop him and security and say he's essentially kicking me and assaulting me and he just laughs at me.

This goes on several times and it's seriously interfering my enjoyment of the show, especially as he's literally falling on me and the people next to me to get over. I keep telling him to stop and he's looking backwards with some goofy grin and he gets led away each time.

This girl I had been next to the entire show was a lot smaller than me, but I made room to my right so she could get an arm on the barrier. I asked her to tell me the next time he passed over. Because she was somewhat sideways, she saw him. 

When he was over me, I ducked down and grabbed his belt with my left hand and leaned away from the stage. My leaning back and everyone pushing him to the barrier meant he was suspended. I started wailing on him. I punched him in the kidneys and liver about 10 times, grabbed his shoes off of his feet, threw them on the stage and yelled in his ear I would beat his face in if he came back again. He didn't come back.

I guess that probably wasn't too petty. Anyway, Mercer Arena isn't anywhere near where you park, so I'm sure he had a wonderful walk to wherever he went with no shoes in December in Seattle.

tl;dr - kick me in the head and jump on me enough times and I'll give your shoes to The Cure",What to do to that one guy who won't stop crowdsurfing,79
iHateYouMang,27,85,1nytgq,267,"Back in middle school I was the biggest crybaby ever. If anyone ever made fun of me i would just want to curl up and cry. My gym teacher took advantage of it alot and took jabs at me whenever he got the chance. Between him and the kids that would bully me i was a giant wreck for those 3 ugly ugly years. 

I eventually grew up out of it in high school by becoming a complete and total cold hearted bitch, alas i digress.

A good decade later i'm working at a convenience store while i wait for my degree to get me a better job and lo and behold the same old gym teacher walks up to me at the counter asking for a pack of Newports. Now at my job I like to play incompetent idiot so i never have to work in the back room and just flash my pearly whites at the counter and pretend i care about peoples days. So between this well done persona of mine and the just wonderful memories i have of this teacher making fun of me all the time, this great idea hits me.

""You're kidding right? I'm like 50.""

TheReverendTholomew,5,21,1ny17i,61,"Disclaimer: This is an extremely petty and childish revenge but fuck it, it felt great at the time.
So in my high school, the dining hall for the juniors has a full wall of windows looking onto the courtyard. It was the middle of autumn and the courtyard had flooded, leaving a puddle that ran the width of the courtyard and came up to mid-shin in depth. I, being childish and hyperactive at the time, decided it would be pretty damn fun to run through it especially since I loved rain.
Now at my school one of the duties of the prefects is to stand ""guard"" at the dining halls to make sure no one is being dangerous blah blah. At the time, the prefect in charge of this was the most emotionally dead and prudish bitch I have ever met (We'll call her PB from now on). She came storming into the courtyard and started shouting and screaming at me and when I protested that I was doing no harm to anyone, she dug her nails into my arm and dragged me to the Headteacher's office (HT).
Our headteacher had just been changed and this new guy terrified everyone. Think Doctor Robotnik/Eggman from Sonic but make him liver-cripplingly Scottish and shove him into a suit and you get something similar to this guy. I was shitting myself all the way there and when we arrived at his office PB just threw me into the room, soaking wet, and stated ""This boy has been running in puddles"" and stormed back to the dining hall.
HT, turns slowly around in his chair and looks me dead in the eye. ""So, you think it's funny...to run around in puddles?!"" His voice not dissimilar to Mel Gibson's ""YOU MAY TAKE OUR LIVES"" speech in braveheart. I just mumbled yes and the pause was horrible before he raised his voice even further and almost shouted ""Well dinnae come complaining to me when you get wet!"".
I instantly ran back to the dining hall and instructed PB to go stand at the window because I had something to show her. I sprinted into the courtyard and ran like a hooded rapist through that fucking puddle over and over and for the finale, kicked water at the window she was looking through. Of course she storms off to HT's office and returns a few moments later after receiving a bollocking from HT for wasting his time.","I don't care how childish it is, I wanna run through the puddle!",82

While working there, I learned a bit about the business and brands they call “bait brands”. Because they offer free shipping and returns, and it’s a competitive market out there, when they sell certain popular styles in these brands, they actually lose money. However, the hope is that having that brand/style will bring you to the site and get you to start browsing and purchase other items that will make them money.

johny1little,2,24,1nxuci,41,"Last spring, me and my brother had to share a car. After a couple of weeks i noticed a trend. When i would go to use the car (after my brother) there would be very little gas left for me to use. I asked my brother nicely to please fill it once empty, or at least let me know so i can at least plan to fill it up. (instead of being half way to my destination and realizing i need fuel). 
One particular morning, feeling flustered, along with being late, i looked down to see an extreme low gasoline level. I decided to in-act revenge.

damageddude,14,39,1nxqnz,144,"Background: There is a road in my area where the speed limit drops from 50 to 35 as the road goes from 4 lanes to 2 as it goes through a residential area. This road is kind of a by-pass for a crowded section of Highway 9 (think of Bruce Springstein) in central NJ and also crosses a major east/west state highway so the local police hang out on that road to get speeders who don't bother to slow down. Locals are aware the police are usually there, somewhere on the road, and keep an eye on the speed limit.

So, one day, I am driving on that road to pick up my son from his karate class and notice the police car hanging out in a parking lot for a park about a half mile from where the speed limit decreases, hidden from the road (I usually look to see if a car is there or not). About 15 minutes later I am coming back with my son and slow down as the speed limit drops to 35. Of course some BENNY from NY (think of the cast of Jersey Shore) starts tailgating me and flashes his lights to go faster and gets increasingly frustrated as I refused to go faster. And then I remember the police officer and wondered if he was still in the park. Well, one way to find out.

Just before the park, the road widens slightly to allow space for a left turn lane into the park. Just before we get to the park entrance I move my car ever so slightly onto the shoulder making the temptation too great for the BENNY. He seizes this opening to fly by me through the left turn lane. As I pass the park I notice that not only is my friend still there but his lights just popped on. He comes out of the park, I pull over like a driver is supposed to when an emergency vehicle has his lights on and watch him quickly close the distance between him and the BENNY.

funnel_web,2,12,1nwxk9,17,"so here i was, fifteen years young at the time, at this cool nature retreat my church does every year. the first night (of the weekend-long event), i decided to carry my cot mattress out of the cabin along with by sleeping bag and pillow, and sleep in the middle of the big field where i could watch the stars and be lulled to sleep by the distant calls of the western screech-owl. meanwhile, although the camp spanned several acres of fields and woodland equally suited to the outdoor-sleeping aficionado, a group of thirtysomethings decided to set up their mattresses no more than thirty yards from me. when i heard them start up a conversation, i assumed that this was typical before-bed chitchat, and let it go. several hours later, after enduring their inane drunken babble for too long, i resolved to get my revenge. i rolled over and drifted off to sleep, with visions of revenge fairies dancing in my head. the next day, i woke up at six o'clock in the morning, ready to counterattack. i grabbed my trusty headlamp and walked over to where the thirtysomethings were asleep. i switched on the headlamp and shined it in their faces. ""rise and shine, sleepyheads!"" i shouted merrily. the sounds and light had wormed their way into the recesses of these peoples' dormant minds, and they began to awaken. ""if you get up right now, you might be able to see the sunrise!"" ""what the hell?!"" one of them responded groggily. by then, they were all awake. ""go away, funnel_web"" they complained. finally, once they were all awake and i began to walk back to my sleeping bag, i heard one of the sweetest sounds ever: the ear-splitting cry of a steller's jay in a tree above my head. by the time i was curled up in my still-warm sleeping bag, dozens of my little cobalt-blue minions were screaming at each other from every tree in the camp as they greeted the dawn. i doubt that the thirtysomethings got any sleep the rest of the day.

Raveynfyre,5,9,1nwu01,8,"*I tried to post this under a different username, my apologies to the mods if this ends up being a double post due to it.*

So my husband and I have three cats. We love them all dearly, and all of them are under 3 years old even though each one was adopted separately. The “middle child” of the three is a monster Maine Coon weighing in at 13-14lbs. You may think, well that’s not that big (?!?) but he is a lean, mean, muscular, biting machine of death (who will not stop growing until he’s 5 years old). His name was inspired by his bloodletting tendencies (Chewbacca, or Chewie). He’s very rarely drawn blood with his claws, and only then it’s usually when we’re trying to clip those needles of doom. This is a two person job unless I can sneak up on him while he’s asleep, Chewie really is that strong. When he goes “full Superman” laying down, his length is from my feet to my chest (I’m 5’4”) and it’s all solid freaking muscle.

The first day he was home he bit my husband on the face and drew blood. The second day it was my turn, on my arm. Typically the biting only occurs when Chewie is being handled or petted against his will (I know, fuck me for wanting to show my pet I love him!). I’ll spoil the end a little and say that the method to our madness has worked and Chewie has really toned down how bitey he is since we adopted him.

We stopped yelling at the bites (except to say “OW”, this is important, you have to let them know it hurts but not by escalation or retaliation. Smacking a cat around does not tell them what they are doing wrong, it only escalates the anxiety factor and makes things worse) and instead we would cuddle him! Months and months and months have gone by using this tactic. Instead of dropping Chewie and screaming at him, or other punishment methods used by less savory people, we cuddle him! He really didn’t like this at first, now he just puts up with it, because he’s learned we WILL get our way. The more he bit us, the more we cuddled him before “letting him” get away from us. (To be fair, we never held him against his will if he really had a freak-out spaz-attack.)

Now he rarely, if ever, bites us when we pick him up, carry him, or pet him against his will. He has almost completely stopped his bloodletting tendencies, and if he bites now, it’s more of a warning nip and doesn’t come close to breaking the skin.

iblamepaulsimon,7,12,1nwtkl,43,"I was at a very important work conference this weekend and it was the perfect opportunity to prove myself since I'm still new to the company. Snuggled in for a good night's sleep to be on my top game for the morning meeting. Around 2am the room next door (connected directly by a locked door) filled with a group of obnoxiously loud people returning from a wedding. I knew they were having a good time and catching up, so I decided not to call the front desk on them. 3am rolls around and I still can't sleep because of the noise. I knock on the shared door, explain my situation, and ask them to lower the volume or move rooms. 

They're quiet... for about two minutes! I finally crank up my AC enough to drown the noise and fall asleep at about 4am.

I wake up to get ready for the day and have an epiphany: the walls must be one way! Surely I can hear them, but they can't hear me, otherwise they wouldn't have been such dicks. There's an iPod dock in the room, so I put it about 3in from the shared door, facing the neighbors, and crank up the tunes for the whole time I was getting ready.

TerrytheMerry,46,122,1nwsvb,562,"So a friend and I went to a concert last Friday and got some awesome spots in the middle right near the barricade separating the crowd from the stage. 

Unfortunately, next to me was a trio of late 40 something or 50 year old drunks, two men and a slutty woman who was wearing a strapless corset top that was way too small for her. The first opener comes on stage, a few awkward older locals who were obviously very nervous. After their first song the woman starts yelling loudly about how shitty their sound is and how she can't hear shit because an amp is directly in front of her. Annoying, but not my problem.

 Then the second opener comes out and the slut is obviously much more excited by them as they are more young attractive than the first, and about half way through their set she begins jumping against me whenever the singer gets near while sloshing her beers all down my back. I'm pretty pissed now and thinking about how I hope there isn't a police checkpoint on my way home, but I'm still in a forgiving mood since the woman is horribly drunk and I know she's probably not all that self aware. 

Then the second group wraps up and we're all waiting on main band, who everyone really showed up for, to set up. I'm talking with my friend when we hear the other drunks trying to calm slutty down about something, I start listening in and I hear this woman threatening to punch ""that skank"" in the face. Curious I listen more and find she's telling the other two that I was roughly slamming into her since the first set and about how she was going to break my teeth. 

Shocked I turned about and as politely as I could apologized but said that she must have me confused with someone else, to which she replied ""fuck you fat ass bitch, put your fake ass tits up!"" This perplexed me for a moment as I thought she meant fists rather than tits, then I realized she was accusing me of lording about my chest for attention, strange considering my top came up to my neck. As her companions decided to cheer her on and throw more insults my way, perhaps in hopes of a cat fight, I simply nodded and turned away thinking 'okay it's my problem now.'

 A few minutes later one of the band members walked out and she began hopping up and down, saggy flesh a jiggling, and I took my opportunity. I took a slight step back, so that she slid right in front of me, and as she bounced I caught hold of the thin bit of ribbon that held her teensy corset top together and watched as she jumped up one last time, pulling loose the knot in the ribbon herself, and all of the flesh that had been packed so tightly burst forth as the top slid to the ground. 

The hag let out a high pitched screech and briefly searched the ground for her cover, before realizing she couldn't find it among the legs of the crowd and littered beer bottles. She then grabbed on of the men and fled the establishment never to be seen again. I waited for someone to point me out or a bouncer to kick me out, before gleefully realizing that with the excitement of the band entering no one had seen me do it. Shame the woman was such a bitch, it was a spectacular concert.

[deleted],12,32,1nwojz,142,"**Background**

I used to work at a high-end electronics retail store and we would often have customers come in to purchase cell phones at their discounted price by signing up for a contract. Obviously we had customers that would do this for real, but a majority of them were identity thieves using stolen credit cards. 

Management told us that we had to go through with the transaction if everything checked out and to let the phone company handle it because ""they needed better security."" It pissed me off to no end that they were valuing money over someone's identity and just refusing to sell those guys the phones.

The scammers are easily picked out of the crowd.  They always entered the store in groups and split ways, stood in the wrong section to purchase a phone, asked for the most basic phones with the most basic plans, and we usually saw the same people over and over purchasing contract phones (if they had business accounts we wouldn't have seen them in our store). While opening a new contract or ""upgrading""/""adding a line"" to existing contracts, we had to go through a vigorous approval process, usually involving their social security card/ID card. 

**The Story**


One day a repeat offender (i helped him ""upgrade"" the week before!) came in and held a spot in our electronic queue. Usually it was first-come, first-served unless we were assigned to the particular section they were in. I saw a couple of people ahead of him but I went for him instead to eliminate him. We went through the process of picking out which phone (he played stupid by trying to ask which one he should get), and started the process. While I was going through the line of questions, he started hitting on me. I wasn't very happy with this, and let him know right away I didn't take too kindly to his behavior. Despite my objections, he kept doing it, and even reached out to touch me at one point. Because of the type of environment I worked in, it took a lot of self control to not punch him in the face and cause a scene.

When the time came for me to check the ID and/or social security number, he handed me a legitimate ID. I started to copy down the numbers when I got hit with an idea--""accidentally"" add some numbers/letters so I will be prompted for a credit check with the phone company. It worked! We had to call the phone company and I had to hand over the phone so that he could answer some questions. His first reaction? ""This never happens to me, what the hell!"" But he went through with the questions anyway. Once he handed the phone back to me, the agent on the other end told me he was approved to move forward. 

I, knowing that his name ""changed"" sometime from this week and the last, told him he was not approved to move forward and he didn't get his phones that time, or every time after.

**TL;DR** Scamming customer made me feel uncomfortable, he didn't get his goods.

Ameise_mit_Bart,98,305,1nwm08,942,"I work in tech support and our ISP also provides cable tv, this just for some background info for this story.

I was working on a friday evening and we knew that there was a problem with the tv head node in one of our bigger cities that we supply. The service interruption was only brief though, after a few minutes, the clients just had to do a new channel search on their devices and that's it.

One client called us and from the beginning I knew she was trouble. She sounded drunk and was screaming the whole time. She was - what are the odds! - from said city with the little tv problem and she was blurring racial slurs, insulting me and my coworkers and throughout the conversation, she was mentioning that she only got four channels (out of 150) left: the Turkish and Serbian ones. Now, she was racist as hell, cursing those channels, generally condemning foreigners and screaming for her beloved tv channels.

The good thing is, I knew exactly how to help her: all she had to was a channel search and she would have been all set. So I told her:

""Unfortunately, there's a problem in &lt;town&gt; with the tv node, our technicians are working on it at the moment, but I do not think they will be able to contact you before monday.""

Silence.

Then screaming again. ""What? The fuck?! No, I don't want this fucking foreign channels, I want my RTL (really shitty private channel with lots of ""reality tv"") back!"".

lucidviolet,8,20,1nwejo,60,"Backstory:  Every Friday, my friend hosts a metal radio show at his university.  One evening he asked me to be his co-host and surprised me during the break by telling me he received an award from the school for the show.  This called for a celebration!

PapBear,1,10,1nw4yd,9,"**Intro*: Hello yall I'm back with a story, so we'll see how it goes. My stories are like my humor, rather hit and miss. That said, I think this one should be pretty solid. My apologies for length

**The Setup**: This happened about 45 minutes ago. I'm in the US, driving home from my university from studying, as out midterms our this week, oy! I'm driving along, there's skeleton traffic, hit the interstate, get off, make my penultimate turn, and all is well. 

**The Scene**: It's 2 lanes each way plus a turning lane. The light just changed, and I'm facing about 2.5 miles of straight road before my neighborhood is in sight. I'm driving at a moderate pace, about 38, accelerating, and the car a little ahead of me is doing to the same.

Out of nowhere, some dude, herein Unblinky, flies out of nowhere, behind the other car and zooms in front me, without using a blinker. Unblinky doesn't even zoom off either, he ends up coasting around 48-50, just a few car-lengths in front of us. I thought he'd race the moon and stars like folks usually do who drive like unsafely. 

Now let me set things straight. I drive fast(85-90, sometimes more), on the freeway, but on the streets, I go a few miles over or under depending on the timing of the lights, and have the ones in my normal circuit well memorized. I know when to coast, when I'll have enougj time to make it, all of that. 

**The Point of no Return**: Unblinky gets a little faster, and beats me to the red light(huzzah?), but he's far enough to have not yet braked. I signal and get into the other lane. The light changes and I'm through the intersection. I'm driving briskly, about 48 in a 40 to catch up with Unblinky, but slow enough to dodge the potholes and dips in the road. I've traveled this road every day the past 4 years, I know it like I know my birthmark. 

**The Polka Asault(revenge part 1)**: As I catch up to Unblinky, I go on my 2nd Gen ipod touch, and cue the Chicken Dance. I have an FM transmitter, so I can play music off anything with a headphone jack. Yeah my ride's not fancy dancy. I love her all the same.

I start it up, and as I got closer to Unblinky, I turned up the volume. I'm next to him, it's the moment of truth. My volume was up to 30, out of 32 or 35, whatever the max is(80% sure it's 32). My windows have been down, and I look over. 

He can definitely hear it coming through. I clapped with the song, and whistled with it, thoroughly enjoying myself, all while he was trying to ignore the hypnotic accordion, to no avail. After about 5 seconds, I sped up past Unblinky, slowly so I could share an epic song with him. I got ahead, signaled and got in front of him. At this point, you go down a hill, then back up, then down again, with a stop sign at the bottom. 

A couple of seconds after I got out front, I let go of the gas pedal and coasted, dropping from about 50 to 30-ish, still dancing and whistling the Chicken Dance. Haha! Enjoy having beautiful polka stuck in your head!

**But wait, there's more!**

**The stop sign(revenge part 2)**: Once we got the stop sign, no one was in sight. This intersection is known for being run, on the regular. Sometimes, even cops run it. I know it's crazy. That said, I usually stop, check all directions, twice, then go. Not this time. 

I checked a grand total of 5 times, in each direction fiddled the with the volume, waited until I saw headlights coming in the distance. I finally drove off, laughing at Unblinky's lost 20 seconds. 

TL;DR: Use your blinker, or I'll waste your time!

To top it all off, I somehow managed to find myself continuously next to or near a group of three obnoxious, over-entitled girls, of whom on was particularly drunk.

After an hour or so I decided to cut my losses and leave, and found myself in the (now 40 minute) coat queue with these wonderful ladies just behind me. At first, they made a not-so-subtle attempt to skip straight past me in the line, but this was blocked with some careful manoeuvring of my substantial bulk.

I was holding the singles in my hand getting ready to drop them into his drawer while distracting him by asking about the current book he was ""reading"" when he said, ""this book is about these extreme liberal *spooks* that hated America called the Panthers"".... leading to my extremely petty revenge.

I dropped those singles back into my pocket and sat back down. He continued antagonize me for being a liberal communist that helps fund terrorists through my involvement in ant-war protests (even though I am a veteran too, apparently that doesn't count anymore). But I'm used to that, I go visit for my mom's sake. 

So racist gramps didn't get my singles. I don't hold his comments against him, he's an old man and he aint' gonna change, but I refuse to help quench the thirst of such a conservative racist.

SarcasticVoyage,2,5,1nv828,55,"I was at Home Depot today buying some screws and a pack of batteries. Since I didn't have a lot I went to the shortest line but the fellow ahead of me had some rolls of vinyl flooring that was taking awhile to ring up. No biggie. It's a Sunday, and I'm in no rush. 

So while I'm waiting, another guy and his family stand behind me in line with their full cart. An employee sees the line forming and opens the next register over, looks at me and says, ""I can help the next in line."" 

As I'm heading over, the guy behind me sees me and hauls ass to the open register like, ""I'm next!"" Honestly, if I had been in his way he would have shoved me. I'm a little perturbed, because I only have two items and it wouldn't take me nearly as long. But I'm not one for confrontation, so I just stand behind him second in line. I wouldn't have minded too much if he didn't give me the most smug ""**I** got here first! You lose!"" glare I had ever seen. That was really what ticked me off. 

Unfortunately for him, his family wasn't fast enough. He kept yelling for them to ""Come on! Come *ON!* Get *OVER* here!!!"" So I took the opportunity to say, ""Well, *I'm* ready."" and throw my screws and batteries on the counter to be rung up. The guy shoots me an evil glare like, ""How dare you!"" and when the employee asks if we were together, he just grumbles, ""No!"" 

It took me all of 30 seconds to pay for my things and by the time I got my bag, the guy's family finally made it to the counter and the last thing I heard as I left was the guy telling them, ""What's *wrong* with you!?"" What a dick.","If he had just asked if he could go ahead of me, I probably would have let him.",60
pettyandshit,34,39,1nv3t2,94,"Until I hit an age where sports and intelligence began mattering a great deal, I was a super unpopular kid. I wrecked the grade curve by effortless hundreds that made my shyly quiet and well-behaved self every teacher's pet regardless of how little I cared, was a super fast developer (never wore a training bra, went straight to a B cup when I was 5'4"" in fourth grade, prompting nicknames like ""Jolly Green Giant"" and endless bra-snapping), and because we didn't have much money back then, my parents dressed me in the grandma clothes that hipsters have deemed popular in recent years (NO one in the mid-nineties thought they were remotely ""cool""). Add in that we were super religious and I attended private schools, and you get an awkward young girl who had books and animals as friends instead of people. 

This obviously made me an easy target for bullying, and in third through fourth grade, the Bitchface McGee that made my life a living hell until we upgraded to a better school had a posse of empty-headed dipshits who likely upped the teenage pregnancy rates in their later years. I spent a good deal of time wondering why she was popular, but private schools can be so weird. She was short (I guess everyone was to me back then), fat, facially ugly by traditional standards, wore glasses and was super loud and annoying. But her dad drove one of those long white vans that transported kids from far away to and from school (eight to twelve of us) and she was outgoing, deriving most of her popularity by her willingness to be a bitch to people less loud and outgoing than herself, so I'd resigned myself to my fate. 

For the better part of two years, BM and her cow-eyed posse did everything they could think of to fuck with me for no reasons other than that I was so shy and unpopular due to the reasons listed above, and they knew that I wouldn't tell on them, simply because I never did. They'd trap me on a merry go round and spin it violently fast while I begged them to please stop so I could get off, and other times they'd run up and shove me off of it while I was playing alone, then laugh at my skinned knees and torn skirts. They'd hit me over the head with their hard-backed textbooks if I was sitting somewhere and no teachers were around. And they LOVED teaming up to have one knock my knees forward while I was drinking at the water fountain while the other jumped up, grabbed the back of my head and slammed my face into the water fountain, then they'd kick me while I was holding my bleeding nose and run off laughing like the addle-headed twats they truly were. 

Cut to three semesters in, where Valentine's day is coming up, and of COURSE everyone *had* to give everyone else a Valentine, whether you really liked that person or not. I was in a stew over having to give my precious Hello Kitty Valentines that I'd saved allowances to buy to BM and The Shits, but a few nights before our class Valentine's Day party, a petty idea crept into my mind and made it's home there. 

So I filled out my cute little valentines, one for everyone in the class as was required, then dug through the closet until I found the remaining few valentines from a box my brother'd used two years prior at a different school. One of the really ""romantic"" crush ones was left and I just *knew* the universe was on my side for this one. Immediately I went to my older sister, who was also bullied by girls in *her* class for similar reasons but in different horrid ways (like hitting her repeatedly with a sock containing a bar of soap in the locker room and laughing about it), explained to her my devious little plan, she agreed to help and we both had a good evil laugh about it. Knowing my handwriting would have been recognizable by my teacher, my sister was kind enough to use her stereotypically girly handwriting to write out my words on the card for BM. They went something like, ""I'm your secret admirer, and today is the best day to tell you how I feel. You're incredible. Beyond description. So much so that when I walk down the hall and see your face every day, my heart stops because you're so amazingly hideous. Seriously, how did you accomplish getting so ugly? Hope you die in a fire, bitch."" She wrote small enough that it fit on the inside of the big card, and I sealed it with old heart stickers that I put all over the valentine, having Big Sis sign the ""from"" box as, ""&lt;3 Your Secret Admirer ;) &lt;3"" 

Then we wrote one for BM's #2 in The Shits, her best Queen of Mean pal, but I'd exhausted my creative energy so she just wrote, ""I hope you do something great with your life, like falling down a flight of stairs and improving the population by dying."" 

A little harsh? Maybe, but the first year I knew them, these girls once wrote all kinds of mean things about me and my family on a quiz of mine they were supposed to be grading for the teacher, then begged my crying ass not to tell on them, swearing they'd ""make it up"" to me at lunch by letting me into their secret club. My sad, lonely heart believed them, did not tell, and at lunch the giggle-cows lead me into the tall grass of the field next to the school where they pelted me with everything saucy from their lunches, hit me repeatedly, and ran away laughing that I was a stupid loser so they'd had it coming for awhile in my book. 

I'll never forget BM's eyes lighting up when she got to my fake valentine, or the crushed horror and tears that happened when she got to the gut-punch lines. Both bullies cried most of the day and were depressed for days after, which cut down on the amount of bullying I had to put up with at the time and that was nice. The principal came and told whoever did it to come forward - I was such a good kid and so full of guilt at the time, I almost raised my hand but didn't, and they never caught me. A lesson at a young age that sometimes simply not speaking up means you'll get away with something. 

Weeks and weeks later right before Easter weekend, BM and The Shits had gone back to their usual harassing ways, but I knew at that point that I was swapping schools the following year so I put on my brave face and endured. That particular friday, BM and The Shits were wearing their new Easter sunday outfits to school to show them off; of course being poor I didn't have one and that seemed to be the Bully Theme of the Day. The cafeteria served super sketchy enchiladas, rice and beans for lunch that day and I was feeling sick, but found an unmanned merry go round on the back playground (there were three) where I could just sit in the middle and keep reading Nietzsche's ""Twilight of the Idols"", a favourite at the time. BM and The Shits show up and spin, spin, spin while I quietly cling and hope they'll stop laughing and go find someone else to pick on. Needless to say I was nauseous as could be from the lunch already and the spinning was not helping. Finally afternoon break was over, the bell rang, we lined up and went in for last period and then I piled into the back of BM's dad's van with the other kids, still feeling violently ill. BM and #2 sat on the seat directly in front of me and chatterboxed their pieholes off for twenty minutes of the hour-long ride back to the place where we'd all meet our parents. 

Every bump, every pothole, I could feel the puke building inside me, but I'd avoided puking so long that I didn't want to be a quitter *now*, you know? Then I got really hot, saw my skin going red and felt the puke coming up, and promptly vomited in my lap, filling the van with the most rancid, Mexican-dump smell you can imagine. The girl sitting two seats down from me saw me puke, and proceeded to vomit in her OWN lap... I'm sure you see where this is going. Everyone was screaming, including BM and #2 who were turned around in their seats, mouths agape like they thought a piece of cake was imminent, and after seeing the other chick puke, I knew I'd be vomiting again. 

*Bing.* Like a firework going off in my mind, the idea hit me square in the face. 

I made eye contact with BM, smiled, and projectile vomited directly in her face, dousing her face including her open mouth in my spun-taco-delight and coating some of her new Easter outfit, too. Her reaction? wiping her face madly, she turned screaming and spewed all over #2's Easter outfit and face, and suddenly there were seven kids in this van just coating the interior and each other with ex-lunch. The following forty minutes was a horrorfest, as her father refused to stop, just opening the window and telling us to hang in there, that we were almost there, but I had the joy of watching BM and #2 crying and screaming about their ruined new clothes the whole way back while I smiled quietly to myself, not even giving a fuck about my lap full of grossness in light of the beauty of it all. 

The rest of the year, #2 refused to forgive BM for ruining her special dress with red enchilada sauce puke, and The Shits split off into Twin Turd groups. Anytime BM tried to be a bitch to me in front of others, I'd simply quip, ""Hey, remember that time I puked in your mouth and all over your white, flowery dress?"" to watch her go red with rage and make the other kids laugh. 

I'd finally found my voice. My petty, opportunistic revenge voice, anyways. &gt;:3 

tl;dr: My fourth grade philosophy: Bully me and I'll fuck up your psyche, then ruin your beautiful new dress. The memory still fills me with warm fuzzies.

*Apparently my English is fine :O*


**Background:**
I'm a 21 year old warehouse and shop stocker for (insert famous soft drink company here). I often visit shops for additional work to be done there, thus entering the public.

**The Incident (not an album by PT):**
I was stocking a local supermarket called Víðir. Now, there is a tradition here for young kids, of 4-11 years, to raise money for themselves by creating widespread pockets of super-shitty thrift shops (native: Tombóla). They usually gather outside stores as it is a good place to get customers. 

As I was leaving the store, two boys of maybe 6 years hollered the traditional line ""Do you want to buy items from us?"" to which I curtly replied ""No thank you"" and moved on towards my car. I had not taken five steps when one of them yelled ""You're a fucking cheapskate!"".

Now to interject briefly. I really hate bratty, disrespectful children. Almost nothing irks me more. I was about to tell them to ""Show some goddamn respect!"" when a petty plan suddenly formed in my head.

I decided to put on an act of reacting very childishly. ""Oh, OH?!? Cheapskate? I'll show you cheapskate! How much for the whole fucking thing?"". They were stunned. So I repeated myself: ""How much for the whole lot?!?"". One of them said ""5000 krónur (which is ~40USD)"". I said ""Well for that price you better help me move it to my car"".

They were getting really excited at this point. ""Yes of course we will move it for you!!!"". I nodded acceptingly. They shook uncontrollably, barely containing their glee and began laughing and cheering to one another. Not before long, they would be stuffing their pockets with brand new toys and candy.

I made a flourish of producing my wallet all the while smiling at them. They were still laughing joyously over their success in business. Then, in my outstretched hand was my Credit Card.

""Eh... we can't take those. Don't you have any money?"" one asked.

""I can't pay by card? Awww... that's too bad."" I said in a mocking patronizing way and I walked away. I didn't look back. One of them shouted after me, incoherently, in an angry, sobbing voice.

Aaaaah. That warm feeling of petty revenge.

HeyMrBananaGrabber,14,15,1nuzsj,0,"I live in an apartment building with a shared washer/dryer located in a room off the main building. It's a fairly small building and we've never had any problems, but today ... today the quiet peace we have all lived under for so long took a dark, dark turn. 

I woke up and threw a load of laundry in. Yay clean undies! All goes well, and I leave the detergent on the washer in the universal symbol for ""I'M DOING LAUNDRY""

When I walked in 30 minutes later, holding the next load to put in the washer, my clothes were already in the dryer and my detergent had been placed to the side. Someone had just started a load and placed their laundry basket on the washer. 

My delicate sensibilities! What heathen could disregard the rules of polite society so ruthlessly?! There is evil in this world, and I have seen its face. And it looks like laundry being done.

I put my quarters in the dryer and started the cycle. When it was almost done I added more quarters. When THAT cycle was almost done I added EVEN MORE quarters. 

Three hours later I took my very dry clothes out of the dryer. I may be out 3 dollars in quarters, but your laundry was damp for way longer than you expected! ",You broke the sacred rules of the laundry room,7

He has to use that little extra effort he makes me use. Take that for making me turn the shampoo right side up!

TL;DR Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. 

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.",Shampoo in the shower revenge,4
TombstoneAltar,28,60,1nutfi,188,"This took place yesterday.

A little back story: Since the beginning of this year, I've been trying to lose weight, and generally get into better shape. I've gone through P90X, Insanity, and have recently started doing Keto, which has been practically melting the fat off of my body since I began the diet about a month ago. I've put a lot of time and effort into losing weight. Changing my old habits has not been easy, especially since I still live at home, and my family members generally eat nothing but junk. But I've made a good amount of progress in the past 9 months, and I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far.

Yesterday, I had just gotten out of the shower, and randomly decided to weigh myself. The scale was in my mom's room, so I decided to go pull it out. My younger sister, having nothing better to do, walked into the room behind me as I stood on the digital scale. I honestly didn't expect to have lost a significant amount of weight, since it hadn't even been a full week since the last time I had weighed myself. The scale did its thing, flashed red as it calculated, and boom, up came this number: 165.2 lbs.

I was so stoked. 165?! DUDE. I started off at 195 in late January, and the last time I had weighed myself, I was 168. Not only did I drop about 3 pounds in less than a week, I was officially down 30 pounds since I had started! It was a fantastic feeling. I cannot express to you how happy I was in that moment.

Unfortunately, my moment of happiness was short-lived.

My sister comes up behind me, looks down at the number, and says, ""165? Jeez, you must've put on some weight to weigh that much!""

I just stared at her for a moment in silence. Maybe I was glaring or had a scowl on my face, I'm not sure. Whatever I was doing, I could tell from my sister's expression that the way I was looking at her was perfectly channeling the burning torrent of rage that was now coursing through me. She knew, in that moment, that she had royally fucked up. The look in her eye spoke to this very clearly. She knew that she had ruined what was supposed to be a very happy victory for me. And she also knew that I don't take things like that lying down. No. Not this guy. I get even. I find a way to settle the score. And when my hunger for vengeance is finally sated, I never let my victims forget the moment that my pride and honor were avenged.

""Get on the scale"", I growled at her. ""No, I don't want to"", she whined. ""GET. ON. THE. SCALE"". One word at a time, each word coming out more like a bark than a clearly pronounced syllable. She saw that now, there was no way out of this. I would hound her until she stepped onto that digital scale. It was going to happen, one way or another.

Her head hanging, and a defeated expression on her face, she stepped onto the scale. We both looked down at the display. Red flashing, and then a number.

179.8.

I stood tall, now feeling an overwhelming sense of triumph. ""Ha! HA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Who's the fat one now, huh?!"" I pointed and laughed at her, smirking as she quietly hung her head and pretended not to care. Her older brother now weighed almost 15 pounds less than her. I gloated to her about it for about 10 minutes, savoring the justice I had won for myself, and knowing full well that, being someone who immensely enjoys the misery and discomfort of those who have wronged me, I will continue to mock and belittle her for this incident for as long as I still find pleasure in it.",Ruin my weight-loss success moment?

shinydragonite,12,14,1nus2g,92,"One day I worked until midnight. It was a long day and I had class at 8 the following day. So I drove home, thinking only of passing out in my bed for six or so hours before getting up for school. But when get back to my apartment building I discover a rude surprise: all the parking spots are taken, but one teal asshole geo metro is parked ON the line, taking up two spots! I couldn't believe that the smallest car in the park would have the audacity to take up two places! But since it's so late I find a place to park on the street a couple blocks away (even the street is full, I live near a university), and walk back to the building.

The next day I call the PM (property manager) and tell him about my this dickhead geo, and he tells me that effectively, he can't do anything. Great. 

So days pass. I check the parking lot frequently, and I soon see the dickhead geo roll up, and the face of my tormentor is burned into my memory as he steps out of his car. Most days he parks normal, but some days he still parks like an asshole. He don't give a single fuck.

Now to the weekend. I go out to the apartments shared laundry room, as I do every week, and as I go to open the door, guess who steps out? That's right, the fucking a-hole geo man. I'm not a confrontational person, so I let him pass without a word. However, once inside the laundry room, I put my clothes in the washer, then check the dryer.

1800goaway,6,7,1nup5q,39,"I admit that I am sort of anti-social.  At the end of the day, I just want to go home and be left alone.

Once a week or so, I stop into one of 2 sub shops - the national chain place or the local place.  Nat'l chain is faster/cheaper but local place is slower/more expensive but worth it.  They are in the same shopping center.

For the last several months, there's been this guy - let's call him Sting - that I've run into at both places.  Maybe he has his own social issues but whenever I'm in line in front of him, he stands reallyreallyreallyclose.  Like if I move I'm touching him close - and if the shops were small and crowded that would be one thing but normally, there's 3 or 4 people total in line so he's too close for an almost empty store.  Even when I move forward in the line, it's like he's crowding me forward so I'll hurry up or something.

He also will sit very close to me on the bench in the local shop - even if we're the only two people waiting and there's another bench.  (And no I don't think he's attracted or trying to hit on me. He's 20 something, I'm almost 50 and not cougar material. He never says anything to me and I definitely don't know him).

Anyway, at each shop he orders the same thing - along the lines of an Italian cold cut then orders chocolate chip cookies at the national chain and cheesecake (very good and usually only a piece or two left by 5 pm) at local place.

On the last 4 visits when he's been behind me, I've bought all of the chocolate chip cookies or whatever is left of the cheesecake. Two days ago, I was going into local place as he came down the sidewalk and he turned away and headed over to Nat'l chain. 

I was able to order and wait without feeling like I was going to be mugged. And I got cheesecake anyway  woo!

NYArtFan1,4,13,1num6s,58,"When I was in college I was going to the grocery store near my house. This was in 2002, when everyone with ""something to prove"" had to buy an enormous SUV and drive and act like a huge dick about it. Anyway, I had just parked my car and was starting to walk through the lot to the front entrance of the store. Suddenly, a guy in an enormous SUV drove down the same lane I was walking up. To be clear- I was well over on the side, and he had tons of room to drive by.  Rather than ease over a bit, this cocky douche decides to ride up and nearly hits me. I had to jump out of the way and there were inches between the front of his SUV and me. 

I looked up to see if he'd even noticed that he'd almost run over a pedestrian with his gleaming new SUV, but douchey could care less. Well, I wasn't having any of that. I went into the store and did some light shopping, and on my way out stopped by the deli where they sell cups of coffee. I grabbed a small single-serve of one of those flavored creamers. It was one of the extremely sugary, very thick and syrupy kind of creamer.

charalique,6,15,1nuljd,75,"My first reddit post!  My boyfriend told me I should post this and finally got around to doing it.

My little story is about wonderful rush hour on public transit.  Like other fellow Torontonians know, the TTC is absolutely horrible about overcrowding.  I am NOT a morning person so all I care about while making my way to work, with my eyes half open/brain half awake, is ensuring I 1-get on the right train(s) and 2-don’t fall on anyone.

While wearing flats I have mastered the art of subway surfing – aka the subway is packed and there’s no pole in sight to hold on to so you’re forced to play the balancing game while carrying your full work bag (in hand and not over your shoulder!) and a coffee.  I totally get that some people don’t have great balance and you usually get bumped by people who catch the momentum a bit late and are trying not to fall over….no problem.

Then you get the people who don’t even try.

One day this lady was standing particularly close to my side.  No biggie…sometimes you just can’t help getting into others’ personal space.  When the train started to stop I felt her start to bump into me and then all of a sudden I had to brace myself because her full weight was upon me.  Again, no biggie…sometimes you just get caught off guard.  Then the next stop was the same-wtf???  I woke up at this point and started to pay attention.  I noticed as the train swayed/ stopped/started she was relying on her wedged-in-close-proximity-to others (but mostly to me) to keep her on her feet.  Mind you, she was not elderly and looked to be physically fit.  Ah hell no!  I was not having any of that.  There’s no way you’re going to try to use me as your personal leaning post.

When I felt her leaning in at the next stop I slowly inched my way closer to the person on my other side and stepped slightly sideways so there was a “bigger” gap between the 2 of us.  No easy feat in the sardine can, but I sucked in and tetrised a way.  She started to lean, upper body first, into the void and as her legs tried to keep up she stumbled and apologized for crashing into everyone around her.  With a triumphant smirk on my face I also eluded her following attempts and noticed everyone else getting annoyed.

If you can’t stand on your own 2 feet or can’t get to a pole to hold on to WAIT FOR THE NEXT TRAIN.

So I work in a hotel and was at work last night. I start at 3 and don't get off until 11, so I was ready for the evening. I see that we have about six check-ins, so I was fully prepared for a slow evening, and brought a book to read while there. Mind you, I am the ONLY person at the front desk for the night, and the manager has left for the day, so I basically run the show that night. We hardly ever have a 2nd person on second shift, so I'm use to making the calls and do call the manager when I need special permission for something. 

5 rolls around and our bartender shows up. 5:30 comes, and no cook. We check the schedule, and it turns out that the cook who was scheduled for Saturday and Sunday no longer works for us, and nobody else is on the schedule. So we are flipping out, trying to get a cook here, but one isn't answering his phone and the other isn't at home and at an event. So, it's a nightmare. 

At about 6:30, I get a call from the ""fire department"" demanding to speak to a manager, and inform him that the manager has left, and he thinks quit. I tell him they're gone for the evening, and offer to assist. He demands to speak to the supervisor, and once again, inform him that there isn't one. I'm getting pretty irritated, because he is doing nothing but yell. The bartender was at the desk trying to find the numbers for the cooks and could hear him yelling. He says that he'll be there shortly, and hangs up. 

I run back to the back for something, and the bartender had answered the phone, and is explaining that there is a front desk associate he could speak to, and hands it to me. I'm pretty sure it was the same guy, because of the voice and how he spoke, but not sure. He says that he's a Platinum member, meaning he's part of our rewards program and basically the top tier. His flight has been cancelled, and the voucher was for a different chain but they aren't answering, so he wants to try and use it here. I say we can't do that, and he asks for out government rate and I tell him it's $100 as opposed to the $109 for the night. He says he's at the airport and needs to be picked up, meaning I'd be the one who has to get him because I'm the only one who knows the shuttle there. (Hell, I'm really the only one there with power) He asks how long, I say 5, 10, 15 minutes depending on traffic. He says to make it 5 because the others are too long. He hangs up, and I'm just like ""What the fuck"" at the conversation. And I leave after about 5 minutes to go and pick him up, cause he was acting like a bastard I wanted him to have to wait 10 minutes.

So I pick him up and make small talk, doing my best to not snap at him for being an asshole. We get back to the hotel and I unload his bags, and he asks if we have a restaurant, and I say we do, but our cook hasn't shown up and are trying to find one. He didn't like this, and starts complaining about how he had better get a steak or he was leaving. Obviously, I don't like this guy at all, and just want to be done with him. We get in, and the bartender is still at the desk trying to get a hold of a cook, but to no anvil. I start checking this guy in, and is asking about the cook. I tell him that it's a toss up as to whether or not we'll have one, and he starts bitching and moaning, and then the owner calls. 

He can tell that I'm on the phone with a person with more power than me, and figures out it's the owner. He asks why aren't they getting off their ass and coming in to cook for him, and I tell him that the parent company told them that they are not allowed to work the desk, or restaurant or else they would pull the brand from the hotel. More yelling and complaining, and he demands a discount in order to stay here. I just want to be done with him, and drop his rate to $89 dollars for the evening which is not a major loss. He is also demanding some free drinks, and now if it was from the draft, then we could do that. But he doesn't like beer, and is demanding free drinks from our selves. I told him I have no control over what happens at the bar, but I did tell the bar tender to not give him anything for free. I don't know what happened with his paying, but I bet she wouldn't budge.

Now we have 6 floors in the hotel, and the 6th floor is the member floor. It doesn't have much more, but it does have an extra water heater so the water has less chance of going cold. And whenever we have a Platinum member, we HAVE to upgrade to a suite if we have the availability to do so. 

Now we have two different kinds of suites. One that is two bedroom (SK), and really nice, and one that's one larger room and OK (STK). They both have pull out sofas, and the STK only has one TV and kinda awkward to use if you want to sit on the sofa due to the layout. The SK has a TV per room, and is a pretty nice room. l We also have a fast food place right next door, and that side can get pretty loud some nights. So I out him on the 5th floor, which is just another floor, in one of the STKs, all the way at the end of the hall (he was a large man and said he doesn't want to walk) and put him right next to fast food place. I haven't heard anything, but I really hope that the place next door got loud and bothered him all evening, couldn't watch TV easily, and got his exercise. 

In the end the managers who left had to come in and cook, and I saw they were catering a bit to him, but it sounds like he calmed his ass down. 

tl;dr: Entitled large man demands that I retrieve the holy grail and bath him with it whilst feeding him fruit from the Tree in the Garden of Eden while singing ancient African Tribal hymns. I place him in an OK room, not on our member floor, all the way at the end of the hall way, facing a fast food joint that can get loud and might keep him up.

vacillated_solipsist,12,76,1nuen4,272,"While at the engagement/wedding ceremony of my girlfriend's younger sister (non-western matrimonial custom), we were intermingling with a lot of her relatives, several of whom I had never met before. There was one aunt that I had heard of in passing, mainly for her decision to refuse to help financially and/or return from her month-long romance in the Netherlands to attend to her dying father's bedside, but was perfectly available when it came time to discussing his will and assets (the poor man died while she was still out of the country trying to convince some Dutch guy to marry her and grant her EU citizenship.

Needless to say, she isn't the favorite aunt of my girlfriend and her sister. Well she took it upon herself to place herself on my own shit list while at the wedding by pulling my girlfriend from her responsibilities as host and having a nice long chat with her. When my gf was finally rescued away by the arrival of some mutual friends, she was fuming.

Why was she so mad? Well apparently, based on a five second assessment of me, she calculated that I must obviously be nothing more than a fling, a prop of my gf that would do nothing but delay and distract her from the more important things she should be focusing on right now, mainly: focus on your career and find the right man. Get married. Have a baby before you'll realize too late you actually want one. Basically, ""don't waste your time with this foreigner"".

Well, while miss gf had to cover up her rage for the sake of putting on a fantastic wedding for her sister, I was not so obliged. After having been poetically told to ""fuck off"" multiple times in their conversation, the aunt decided to approach me and further confirm her preconceived assessment of my eligibility. Probing questions of where I was from, where I was going to go next, how old I was (apparently me being younger than my gf was a big issue), etc., were all met with smiles and honest responses. After all this is a wedding right? We can all be civil, decent adults for the sake of the love and happiness of the newlyweds.

I kept my mouth shut, smiled for the camera, and suppressed any desire to express how I really felt about her plastic surgery. I remained the perfect gentleman.

Until this perfect gentleman had to shit from the cheese covered, bacon-wrapped lobster rolls. Then I ripped one hell of silent fart right next to her face as I walked past her chair at the empty corner of her table on the way to the toilet.

trousershorts,11,52,1ntuvw,79,"This happened a few weeks ago but it always feels good talking about it again:

**BACKGROUND**

I was already having a terrible week (bike AND car broke down on the same day, other class-related BS) so the only thing I could look forward to was my university's once-a-semester Career Fair and check out the co-op/internship opportunities. The day came and I had great talks with several popular defense companies (where I want to have a career) until my very last conversation with the most popular business there.

**The Incident**

I was waiting for roughly 20 minutes when I was pulled out of the line by one of the representatives. It wasn't the one I had been waiting in line for but that didn't matter, I had a chance to talk... or so I thought... Introductions were made quickly and he asked me if I had a resume on me. Naturally I handed one out and I will never forget what he said: ""This resume is crap, you will never get a job with this."" At first I thought he was joking but after the awkward silence ended I saw he was serious and my heart sank. He then prattled on about how he was a retired high-ranking (as in almost a general) member of the military and the advice he gives me will save my resume. Unknown to him my mother is a recruiter (and a very successful one, at that) who works exclusively in the engineering field so I knew my resume wasn't shit (oh, and I also already landed a co-op with that resume a semester earlier). Not only was he criticizing something I spent a great deal of time on, which I can handle and do expect, he was also indirectly calling her competence into question. He did give me a few good pointers but I could feel the elitism and haughtiness exuding from his presence every time he spoke, like I knew nothing of the professional world. Once he finished his rambling he looked back at my GPA and said ""You're a smart kid, do your homework"". Out of sheer decency I shook that hand but it felt like thanking someone for ripping out your teeth. I had never felt so humiliated since, you know, at least 20 people were within earshot of the whole thing.

After that massacre I went back to my dorm and cooled off as best I could. Later that day my roommate came in as pissed as I was. Turns out this guy did this to everyone he talked to. I also found out that this specific company, although very popular with students, isn't looking to hire anyone. They just have to be there to fulfill some bullshit equal opportunity claim. Needless to say I'll never look at this business the same way.

**The comeback**

The next day I attended a focus group with a senior member of my university dealing with prospective student tours, we would bring up each building and decided what points should be highlighted. Once we got to where the career fair is held every semester I told her about what had happened yesterday. She was absolutely livid and ended up reporting it to the president of the university. I have no idea what became of it but if that guy is banned from the career fair because of it I know a lot of students that would be very happy. I guess I'll find out next semester!

jimdig,5,12,1ntrxk,33,"I recently had surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon.  My daily commute to work involves a little over a mile of walking (house to bus, bus to subway, subway to work).  During the recovery time at home I quickly came to the conclusion that crutches would not be the best way of making this trip twice a day.  I acquired a knee scooter from my doctor which, if you haven't seen/needed one, is kind of like a four wheeled razor scooter with a pad around knee height.While I do enjoy wheeling up to a queue at the handicap elevator and catching the quick look of shame on a few able-bodied commuters as they silently slink away to the escalator this a story of one that did not yield.I generally shoot for the ends of the subway train as this where the elderly and handicapped are supposed to have preference.  I know this because there are signs posted that say as much.  The end of the row having room for walkers, wheelchairs and yes, knee scooters.  Most people, myself included, choose them for the leg room.  Most people, myself included, also quickly vacate the seat when appropriate to allow for someone who clearly needs it more.So I entered the last door on the last car and turned towards the front to survey my two options.  On the left of the aisle was a woman and young daughter with quite a bit of luggage.  On the right a single middle aged man with his suit coat folded on his briefcase between his feet.  I wheel up to him and make the generally accepted nonverbal signs that I would like to use one of the two seats he is currently using. I smile, make eye contact.  He smiles back. I make imploring look with head nod towards seat.  He loses the smile and widens his legs.  I get that he may have a need that isn't readily apparent on first glance, but I'm not asking him to stand, just move over a bit.  Neither of us are obese, there should be plenty of room, but here I am standing on one leg right in front of him as the train gets going.What with me being so close and certain laws of motion working as they do, it was too bad I 'forgot' to engage the brakes when the train did.  While his quick reaction and suitcase prevented me from actually hitting him, it was still worth it.  I hope he enjoys cleaning my wheel mark off his coat as well.",Petty by way of inertia,45

Now, ordinarily, I would just set the alarm on my phone like I do every morning, but my brother had lost his phone and was borrowing mine for the day. My mom woke me up an hour and a half later, yelling that I was irresponsible to have missed my lesson and needed to get out of the house that second. She continued to insult me until I began to cry.

I work as an EMT in a decent sized city. We tend to run call to call, and get all sorts of calls. One night, we get called for a call coded as a Psych. A gentleman had been having a bad run of luck, and was feeling depressed. So my partner and I show up, and I begin to speak with the man. The gentleman begins to tell me about how he had been kicked out of his home, by his wife, for drug use. This caused him to feel depressed, and spiral into the world of homelessness and drugs. He had a revelation earlier, and he wanted help, so he called us.

I move him into the back of my ambulance, and the guy begins to break down, crying because he feels hopeless, worthless, and he can't stop apologizing for wasting my time. I am in the middle of trying to calm him down, and have a conversation with him while I take a blood pressure, and begin to get a little bit of demographic information, when I hear my partner yell from the front seat.

I look around, and in the back window, I see a hand, and an iPhone in the corner of the window. I begin to see red, as I realize what the guy behind my ambulance is doing. Not only is he taking a picture of me, he is taking a picture of a man who is already feeling like he has hit rock bottom, and is sobbing in the back of my ambulance. The man realizes as well that he is being photographed, and says something along the lines of ""If I was them, I would be taking pictures of someone as useless as me as well.""

The handle is right next to where I was sitting, which was on the bench inside. So I tell my patient to hold on a second. I grab the handle, and kick the door open with all my strength, and hop out right afterwords.

The door flies into the guys hand, and his phone goes 10 feet into the road, with a satisfying crack that can only be the sound of a screen breaking upon sidewalk and pavement. I give a halfhearted apology stating that I didn't see him, and that I was trying to find my jump bag. The kid, who appeared to be early twenties, and drunk, was too dumbfounded to say anything. I get back in the ambulance, and we begin to pull away. I look back, to see the kid pick up his phone, look at it, and throw it against the wall, in what I assume was a post-screenbreaking act of rage. Felt good man.

meguriau,15,19,1ns7l5,26,"Hi everyone, it's my first time posting in this sub. I've lurked in it for the longest time until today when I finally realised I had something dating back to about 4 years ago.

I'm from Australia where schools generally hold a formal every year for the final three years of high school. My school was no exception. I was in my final year and this was to be the biggest celebration of them all. 

To top the previous two formals, our grade's committee had organised a gorgeous three-tiered cruise ship that would coast its way through Sydney Harbour with the backdrop of the setting sun. 

Now, I was never that keen about formals but this year, I was excited about graduating yet sad that this may be the last time I see my grade altogether so I wanted everything to be perfect. Additionally, I invited my boyfriend at the time to be my date. After informing him that the dress code would be semi-formal, I let him know that I would see him at the wharf around half an hour before departure, something he did not like the idea of. He wanted us to arrive together and was quite petulant about it. (Also, between inviting him and the actual day, we were hitting quite a rocky point.) 

After spending the whole day getting ready, my dad drove over to my friend's place and headed to the wharf. Upon arrival, I saw a familiar figure of my date wearing a suit facing the water away from me. I called his name, he spun around and... oh. To be fair, he was wearing a suit but his top... he was wearing a shirt reminiscent of Hawaiian T-shirts in both print and colour. Turns out it was his own form of petty revenge. I was absolutely mortified. As an anti-confrontational person, I passive aggressively retaliated by rolling my eyes in every photo my friend took of us together and we have not spoken since.

So Jason comes in, sees it on her table, and grabs it so she doesn't notice he lost it, as there's a punishment about it. After asking the class who it was, she told us to open our chromebooks and go onto her course website. After logging in and the tabs still open, one of the advertisements play. You could hear the moaning from outside the room. Before he could close even a third of the tabs, the teacher picked up his chromebook.

Mukhers,26,51,1nrmli,188,"Today I shall regale you with the tale of how I scorched my father's tongue off with fiery death sauce! It's long, but worth it.

My dad *loves* his hotsauce. He even has a small collection of his favourites in his 'spice cupboard'. A seemingly innocuous meal could at any moment be 'improved' by the addition of the fires of a thousand burning suns, and he does it constantly. 

Pie? Hot pie is better. Steak? Spicy steak is better. Curry? Mega curry is *infinitely* better. Such is the wisdom of my dad.

One day he decides to 'improve' my meal without my prior knowledge or consent. So here I am, eating my spaghetti, when ***holy mother of God my is my face melting I'm dying is this what hell feels like Hades have mercy***.

It felt like my mouth was being ripped apart by hellspawn coated in pure capsicain. I was spluttering, coughing, gagging, and retching all at once.

Dad, on the other hand, was giggling like a school girl, having a merry old time whilst his eldest son attempted to scour his tongue of the attempt on his life.

With teary eyes and a sweaty brow, I vowed my revenge.

I began by compiling a list of what sauces he had and how often he had them, to roughly gauge his tolerance for chili. Then, I researched. What sauce would nuke his mouth and possibly leave him paralyzed?

[This](http://www.chilliworld.com/SP6.asp?p_id=346) was the sauce I chose. It had a Scoville rating of between 4 and 4.5 million. To put that into perspective, common pepper spray is 2 million, and police grade pepper spray is around 5 million. This shit is fucking *lethal*. It also was ludicrously spicier than anything else in dad's collection.

This was it. My weapon of choice. I ordered and waited gleefully for this tiny vial of poison to arrive, eagerly awaiting the day my father gained his comeuppance.

Since the bottle was quite small, 50ml or so, it was a one trick pony. I'd only have one chance for this sweet/spicy revenge. The moment struck during dinner, when he went to the bathroom.

I quickly poured *all* of the bottle onto his meal (some pie, I believe), making sure to evenly apply it over his whole dish. The rest of the family were in on it and were just as excited as I was. When he came back he even *thanked* mum for saving him the trouble of pouring hotsauce on his meal!

We watched expectantly as he took his first bite. The food had barely entered his mouth before the effects begin to manifest. 

His eyes water. Cheeks go bright red. Sweat is beading on his whole body. There's a single cough. Then an outburst of coughing and spluttering. Then a moan of terror and pain.

I had reverted him into a primeval state. All he knew was the scorching fury inside his his mouth, burning his throat and nostrils. Unintelligibly shrieks of agony could be heard from streets away as he ran to the fridge for milk, yoghurt, *anything*. 

All the while I, his eldest son, watched in smug victory.

Maybe I was sadistic to enjoy the image of my father trying to put a bag of frozen peas in his mouth as he openly wept. But *damn* I felt good.

I'm studying Electrical Engineering, and I have this asshole of a professor.  Every few days, he'll give us a pop quiz on something that he hasn't lectured on and that wasn't mentioned in the recommended reading.  When people fail, he goes off on a rant about how we should be reading ahead.  We've tried to explain to him that we all have full courseloads, and it is impossible to be prepared for a pop quiz every day because we simply have way too much work to do in our other classes.

But his douchebaggery doesn't stop there.  Our labs are worth 20 points, as are our homeworks/quizzes (we're on the 1000 point system).  When he grades, he will take a minimum of 5 points off.  If we forget to write one formula, or have a typo, he immediately takes off a fourth of our grade.  Two mistakes?  Half of our grade.  Basically, he sucks.

However, it turns out that he loves his Computer Engineering students.  They all say he's the nicest guy, and he never takes points off for late turn-ins or anything.  I've heard of professors hating students not in their major, but I didn't think they really existed.

**""Revenge"":**

Last week, this cuntwagon gave another quiz.  A little more than half of the class got a 1, and the rest got a 0.  When he collected them and realized how poorly we had done, he told us that none of us will be good engineers, and he will try to fail us to make sure we change our major (of course, when someone does well, he accuses them of cheating).  He then said that he's going to re-write our midterm to make sure we all lose enough points that we can't pass the class.  This rant included several other things that I don't really remember.  All I know is I was really close to walking out on his lecture and heading straight to the Dean's office.  But I hate tattle-tales.

So I studied non-stop for 4 days (as did my group of friends/study partners).  I read the entire book twice, memorized every formula, term and process for solving the problems.  Then I looked up powerpoint presentations and notes from other schools.

I finished the exam in about 45 minutes (we had 2 hours).  I handed him the exam, smiled and said, ""Have a nice day!""  He just glared at me.  A few minutes later, my friends all walked out, saying that they did the same thing.  I got my grade today...195 out of 200.

I wish I had seen his face as he was grading my exam.  Unfortunately, this semester is only half over, and he'll probably still try to make us fail.  Fortunately, we are given end-of-semester surveys to take where we grade our professors.  The results can sometimes determine whether a professor keeps his job (we have to give legitimate reasons to be taken seriously...not just ""He gave me a bad grade!"")

RedditRalf,2,11,1nrcyd,25,"So my manager at work keeps getting these pesky phone calls from telesales leading to a waste of our time. 

Me and the manager are in the office at the moment, phone call. 

I dont know why, I think my manager was not in the mood to talk to these cretins, so he passed the phone over to me and told me they where asking for the owner, well I for sure am not the owner but thought it would be fun to play along. 

Telemarketer on the phone.

*'hallo sir, are you the owner of the business?*

*'Yes how can I help'*

*'I would like to offer you a great deal from our electricity provider.'*

Well along those lines, at this point it is required that a great deal of interest is played when saying

*'I dont deal with the electricity charges but I know the person who does is very keen on changing companies.'*

At this point I signal to my manager that we leave the office with the phone off the hook on the table to the telemarketer salesman.

I went back 5 minutes to the office to see if the telemarketer was still on the other end, still on the other end I dont think he realised what was going on.

A week or so later I am riding my bike down the street, and notice our chair on the patio at an apartment building. There are other assorted chairs, and patio furniture, which was obviously also stolen. I grab my chair and take it back home. Then I go back and place all the furniture by the street so that others might see them and claim them.

I check the apartment door and it is open. Nobody home. I grab their BBQ grill, which was full of dust and remains of charcoal, and proceed to throw it all over their living room, and onto their white couch!

Grave_Girl,6,38,1nqq93,0,"I'll try to keep this short.

I live in a four-plex with a parking lot out front.  The lot is unlined.  Of the four units, only one other unit owns a vehicle.

Two Fridays ago, I went out with my kids to get in my vehicle and leave to pick my husband up from work.  There were two trucks that didn't belong here parked very close to mine.  When I parked my vehicle, the lot was empty except for the other car that actually belongs to a resident, so these douchecanoes parked close to me on purpose.

Guy on the left had a big shiny new F-150.  King Ranch edition.  Dripping chrome.  Looked freshly washed.  It was about a hundred times nicer than my 15-year-old Durango, in other words.  And it was parked so close, my daughter couldn't get the back door open even halfway.  Now, we have two car seats side-by-side and a kid to go in each of them, so when you're buckling someone in the outer seat it's not like you can kneel in the other seat where the other kid is being buckled in.

Every time she tried opening the door, it tapped the truck and rebounded on her and my two-year-old.  Mama Bear woke up.  So I hauled my fat (230lb) ass over there and slammed the door open, caught it before it could rebound onto my kids, and *leaned* all my weight against it, pushing it into the other vehicle.

toofarfromnothing,6,54,1nqnov,268,"Just found this subreddit, and I've been reading it for hours. I have a story of my own that I thought would fit well here:

When I was in college, I worked as a cashier at one of the dining halls on campus. Students had all different types of meal plans, but there were only three types of currency: punch, dining dollars, and flex dollars. Punch = a meal (e.g. sandwich, chips, drink) roughly equivalent to $5. Dining dollars could be spent on food only, but allowed you to buy things a la carte. Flex dollars could be used for anything (food, books, even some off campus stuff). The most popular meal plan was to have two punches every day, and then a few dining dollars to supplement if you just wanted a snack or something.

So every Wednesday night this arrogant meathead would come in to our dining hall and order two meals worth of food, then proceed to the register and ask to ""double punch"" (if you had two punches a day on your meal plan and you didn't use any before 5pm, you could use them both at the same time after 5pm... i.e. ""double punch""). Of course, he would only have one punch left that day, and he'd always say, ""I haven't used my other punch, I should have two, blah blah."" This smug bastard knew that many of the cashiers weren't likely to make him throw away one of his meals (it was always prepared food that couldn't be used again), so we'd often let him through without paying in full. Once I noticed he was making a habit of this, I formulated a plan to make him pay.

I decided to become his favorite cashier (the one that always let him through without a hassle). I discretely checked the balance on his Flex account, and realized he had about $3,000 (wasn't really supposed to check balances except at the customer's request). Every Wednesday for almost a year, I would charge him for exactly what he ordered (using his punch first and putting the rest on Flex dollars). I would hassle him a little every time about not having the other punch, and then pretend to try the card to make it work - but in reality I was swiping a second time to charge his Flex account).

By the time he stopped coming on Wednesday (maybe he realized what was going on, or maybe he moved/left/graduated, who knows), his Flex account was about $900 lighter. feelsgoodman.jpg

TL;DR: Guy thought he was getting meals for free, was actually paying for them out of funds that he likely set aside for books.

There was more space between our rows than there was in that picture.  It was almost as if she had to make an effort to do it.
I tried tapping the back of my chair, bumping my back against the chair, but she didn't get the message.  Or, she decided to keep at it because she's an asshole.

Anyway, I pick a different row to sit in during today's lecture, and guess who sits in front of me!?  It's her.  And soon, her friends sit to her left and right: she's blocked in.  It's already easy enough for me, but then it turned out that today we were watching a documentary film, so the lights were out and the professor sat in the back of the lecture hall.

I wait a few minutes for the documentary to start, and I start to slowly nudge my feet into the back of her seat.  Eventually, I cross my right leg over my left leg, and keep constant pressure on her seat with my right foot.  I also variate the amount of pressure that I am putting out with my foot, so that she is always reminded that it's there.  Whenever she'd start to scribble down a note, I'd drag my foot across the seat or do something else to distract her.  She tapped her seat with her knuckles and did other subtle things  to get me to stop, but I was relentless.

I kept it up for the whole hour, and when the lecture was over she gave out a big, exasperated sigh and started to bitch to her friends about what had happened.

JamieValentine,16,24,1nq9ro,21,"Board plane for a long haul flight. Guy sitting next to me immediately takes all space on arm rest. I have the aisle seat, he’s in the middle to my right. I’m shocked. He’s moving his arm and elbow a lot, even encroaching on to my side past the arm rest space! I begin to fight back, we are jockeying for position. No words are exchanged. I death stare at his arm when it comes in to my space – he ignores, his elbow is rested firmly on the arm rest, I am silently furious. He moves arms to play a film, I STRIKE, moving my elbow in to prime position. He seems shocked at my move; he thought the game was over –wrong. I don’t move from prime position – not for anything. I even open a bottle of wine without moving my right elbow as I know he’ll steal back. I think I’ve won – I haven’t. After about 10 minutes of him moving his elbow – trying to break me the food arrives – this prick is really invading my space now – I elbow back noting that his left elbow is in my space above the arm rest and actually over my right leg, I momentarily give up. I pick up my food, lean back and start shovelling in to my mouth behind his left arm, which is now hovering in front of my space. I think, fuck this, and re-engage in elbow tennis. I know what I’m doing is ridiculous but I refuse to give in. I toy around with calling him out or even worse calling the stewardess. I decide the latter is pathetic and my balls aren’t big enough to say anything, or so I thought….




After we’re finished eating he reengages in arm/elbow tussling. I give up, retreat to my side and his fucking arm is STILL touching mine. I’m angry, but eventually, I fall asleep, beaten. 




I’m having a truly erotic dream involving a threesome with two women – as my dream reaches the climactic point, I’m awoken, and he’s climbing over me in a hurry, presumably to go to the toilet. For a moment I think I’ve had a wet dream. After about 15 minutes, he still hasn’t returned, I laugh in my mind, he’s probably got diarrhoea. After 20 minutes I decide to go to the toilet myself, when there I realise; I DID have a wet dream! I’m excited, I’m 28 and I’ve never had one on my life before. Then again, I’m currently subscribed to r/nofap and it’s been 30 days on hard mode. I have to bin my pants which are full of sperm. I clean myself up and return to my seat. He’s still not there, weird. Probably found another seat somewhere. Whatever, I relax, and spread my arms, and put on a film. The victor, I’m happy, had my first wet dream and now I’ve got all the arm space in the world.




After we land, he returns to collect his jacket, which he left there when he moved to another seat, he actually says something like “I just want my jacket please” but it’s really softly spoken; he almost seems scared of me, what a loser. I’m the arm rest king motherfucker.




Fast forward 2 hours and it dawns on me. The reason he was climbing over me in such a hurry, didn’t return until the plane landed and seemed scared didn’t have anything to do with the arm rest fighting; it was because of the wet dream! He must have seen me having my orgasm and freaked out! At the time that didn’t occur to me, but I had been saving it up for 30 days at this point and must have been jolting around in my seat pretty violently! That’s enough to scare anyone!

I had a lot to accomplish today so I stayed late to make sure everything was done for my shift and that the next shift was set up for success. Another days work. I stopped at Publix the way home to treat myself to a delicious breakfast.

Well, My roommate, his wife and I all moved in to this new house just recently. So recently in fact that I don't have a key to the door. Normally the door is unlocked by the time I get home so no big deal.

Today was different. I come home exhausted and ready to eat and go to sleep. All the doors were locked. Fine, no problem, I will knock on my roommates wife's window and have her let me in. 

Welp, I was promptly greeted by a ""Go Away"" and then continued knocking to which she replies that she is not going to open the door. 

Well, I keep knocking, call my the roommate who is at work and unavailable. Well, I just hang out for about 30 minutes knocking on the window as long as my knuckles could bear then stop.

Finally she opens the door to which she says that the door was open. No it wasn't! If it was I wouldn't be knocking on your freaking window!

So I cooked my breakfast (which I was totally down to make extra to let her have some) and let a hungry pregnant wife smell the delicious aromas and then walk into my room and disable DHCP on her laptop.

I'm just hanging out, minding my own business looking for stuff on the list my wife made me, when I heard something in the next aisle.  Sounded like an argument.  I'm a curious guy so I scadoodled on over to see what was going on.  Some middle-aged soccer mom looking bitch was absolutely tearing into this cherub-faced kid about them not carrying the type of cake mix she wanted.  

""This is ridiculous!  What kind of place is this!  I need that cake mix!  Get your ass to the backroom and look for it again!  I'm having a party tomorrow and have to have it!""  The poor guy looked shell-shocked.  If he was anything over 16 years old I would be so surprised.  But I'll give it to him, he handled it pretty well.  

""I'm sorry ma'am...we don't have any.  I already looked...we have the store brand, though...it's basically the same stuff...I'd be happy to get some of that for you?""  he replied.  Good on you, young store employee.

""NO.  I DON'T WANT OFF-BRAND.  GET ME YOUR MANAGER.""  Cake bitch was losing her shit.  I know cake is awesome, but com'on lady, you're being a big ol' turd.

The kid's manager comes out, chats with the lady who continues to freak out, but eventually gets her just to take the store-brand cake mix.  He and his employee walk past me, staring straight ahead with the eyes fixed on the empty void ahead of them like only someone who works in a retail job can do.

I was feeling a little bit feisty yesterday.  I can be a bastard-coated-bastard with bastard filling sometimes, but I absolutely hate it when people are rude to store employees/waiters/people they thing are 'beneath them'.  Really, really pisses me off. That bitch wasn't getting away with it.  I stalked her through the store, never getting too close to set off alarm.  She moved from aisle to aisle getting more things for her impending bitch-festival, not knowing that a predator was about to strike.  She got some pretty delicious looking things, I might add...but I wasn't after those.  I had my target.  I was going to take that fucking cake mix.  

I knew exactly where it was in her cart.  Her cart was getting pretty full so I decided to move in for the kill. The petty-revenge gods were on my side because somehow the cake mix wasn't covered by anything.  She turned her back on her cart and bent down to get something off the bottom shelf.  I rushed in, very nonchalantly snagged the cake mix out of her cart, and moved on.

Of course I had to watch to make sure she checked out.  In fact, I made sure I was right behind her.  She didn't notice a thing.  For how big of a deal that damn cake mix was to her, I was surprised how little attention she payed to what she put on the conveyor belt.  

I smiled all night thinking about how she got home, unloaded all of her groceries, but couldn't find the cake mix.  She probably went back out to her car, looked around, maybe under the seats...but guess what lady, it's not there.

That cake mix deserved better than her.  *I* bought it.  It was confetti cake mix.  It might have been for a kids party for all I know, but I don't care.

I found myself to be slightly ahead of the curve in his class, seeing as how it was an applied instead of academic but I didn't need the academic credit for college.

One day I walk into class and he's at his desk reading a copy of Twilight in a very intrigued manner. He asked me if I had read the series and I told him that I hadn't and they did not ""challenge me.""

In a scoff of disgust he immediately assigns me to read the series AND to write a test on it after my English exam. As a high-schooler I didn't really have the option to refuse.

So over the course of two months I had to drag myself through the 4 books and had been fully disgusted with how it was written, due to the fact that I could skip several pages at a time without missing anything important to the plot, and that Mr. B had a smug expression on his face every time he saw me with a book and my glum expression every time I had to read it.

The storm clouds of revenge had began to form.

A few days prior to the exam, I had a conversation with the Vice-Principal about this shit he was pulling. The VP dismissed this as a joke. So with no one in the administration to back me up, I had to act alone.

On the day of the English exam/Twilight test, I had completed the English exam and waited patiently for the subsequent test.

But Mr. B, who was supervising the exam, was nowhere to be found. A few minutes later he returned with a shitty looking question paper and his usual smug expression. I looked over the 10 questions, took the sheet of paper and walked out of the class without saying a word. I walked out of the school, disposing of the test , and in less than 12 hours I was on a plane to enjoy 12 days in Florida as a graduation present from my dad THUS missing 5 days of exam review and since the Twilight test wasn't in the curriculum, Mr. B couldn't grade me on it and I knew I had already passed the class with an A.

It doesn't stop there.

After my first semester (in which this happened) I was to be enrolled in a full-time work placement that would contribute to me finishing my diploma and secure me into college acceptance. This meant that I spent about 1 hour in school per month until I ""graduated"" and I would never see Mr. B.

I did see him at convocation the following October, he apologized to me.

Fierce_Fox,68,86,1npqx0,391,"The other week I got some new neighbors in my apartment complex. A nice elderly couple and their douchey man-child son. I like the parents, they're the sweetest folks I've met in KC yet but their son... their terminally unemployed douchebag son is a different story. This guy loves his Edd Hardy bullshit shirts, cologne,  and spiked hair like its cheap liquor which he also loves judging by the bottles left on the porch. He also has a penchant for playing shitty rap as loud as possible once everyone else goes to work for the day. This isn't a problem for the other two units because they're at work but I'm home during the day and usually asleep since I work nights. 

The first day I ignored the loud music because I was tired from a crappy night at work and not in the mood to deal with his shit. I turned on my own ambiance /white noise stuff and tried to get some sleep. His music kept going until about 3pm when folks start coming home after which he turned it off. I got some real sleep after that which was nice. When I woke up that evening and went outside to have a smoke and let my dog run around and potty I caught the douchey son having a smoke too. We made a bit of chitchat and learned this guy's parents paid for all his shit so he didn't have to. He was recently divourced so his parents had taken pitty on him and taken him in. He bragged about the shiny blue hatchback with the bitchin rims that belonged to him which was double parked at the bottom of the lot and shity stereo system he liked to bump in the day. This was great, a perfect segway into what we needed to talk about so I asked him to maybe turn it down during the day sighting the fact that he's not the only one here during the day, that I live next door and sleep in the day, and common fucking decency. His response was for me to go fuck myself and my shitty rat dog (she's a Belgian Shepherd/Grey Hound mix so she isn't rat sized, but she is shit colored). He said he had a right to play his music as loud as he wanted to during the day and to mind my own business.

Okay chief, I'll play your game. I then spent my night at work trying to figure out how to get back at him. My first idea was to burn the building down whith him in it because I hadn't leveled a building in a while but I like my place so that was out the window.

With fire still on my mind I decided to fight fire with fire and shitty music with one the greatest pieces of music ever written, Beethoven's 9th Symphony. on repeat.

When I got home that morning I unpacked my surround sound system and placed all my speakers right up against the wall. These aren't tiny little things either. These are four foot tall speakers and I have six of them. When their volumes are maxed out these things will leave your ears ringing for day and a half. For whatever reason Douchey McGee didnt bump his beats for a few days and I started to think that maybe he had just had a bad day when I first talked to him. When I'm in a bad mood I can be a pretty gaping asshole so it wasn't too far fetched to me. And then Friday rolled around and at about noon he started his shit again.

I roll out of bed, put my robe and moccasins on, and went next door to try and resolve this shit. I knocked on the door a few times and then pounded on it before he answered smelling of liquor and bullshit. I asked him to turn the music down once and was called a faggot for the pink robe I was wearing. I then demanded he turn the music down before this gets serious. He took that as the threat it was and got all up in my face like we where back on the block and chest bumpedme in an attempt to intimidate me.

Six years in the Army and Afghanistan have made me immune to this kind of shit so I just shrugged it off and put my plan onto motion. I put my CD in the player, cranked the volume and brewed some coffee. I listend to my music for a couple of repetitons before grabbing my ear muffs out of a tough box. Now these things are awesome, they're basically military grade noise cancelers so once they go on I can't hear anything. After about an hour of the Beethoven barage the Douchemaster came and pounded on my sliding glass door with the most pissed off expression he could he could muster. 

Expecting a surrender I turned the music off and opened the door. I was immediately assaulted with a torrent of profanity and threats because he couldn't hear his shit music.

KellyeTheGreat,21,14,1nph8s,44,"Every apartment in my building has assigned parking for 1 car. My asshole neighbors across the hall have 2 cars, and they pay the neighbor down the hall 6 packs of cigarettes a month to use her space because she doesn't own a car.

So even though they are only supposed to have 1 car, they get away with having 2. And they *still* park their car in my spot whenever it's convenient for them. Not only do they park there, they tell their jerkoff friends to park there as well. I've come home with someone in my space so many times. I tried being polite, then I tried being pushy and they just kept parking there.

Finally yesterday I came home after being gone for 20 minutes, and one of their friends was parked in my spot again. I went to their apartment and told them to move their damn car. The boyfriend and girlfriend that live there were home, and they had another guy and girl there as well. All 4 of them were high as hell with glassy eyes and you could smell the pot smoke.

Completely past the point of being polite or maintaining neighborly relationships, I ripped into the girl. She started screaming at me about how I need to be less of a bitch, and ""suck my man's dick"" (lolwut). I'm so fucking sick of these people and their constant drugs, fighting, and screaming at each other in the hallways because she beats him and he refuses to get a job.

So after the fight was over, I came home and emailed my landlord about the situation (who loves me, and has always backed us up as good tenants who consistently pay rent on time and perform our own maintenance) and he emailed me back that he is sending them a notice and a fine for parking in my spot, but *that isn't my petty revenge*

As I'm making my left turn onto Germantown, a white utility van comes around the blind corner *fast.* I floor it and fishtail my way up the road to avoid getting hit because this idiot is driving too fast on a dangerous road. 

The idiot decided it was my fault he almost hit me, so for the next 3 miles of dangerous bends and steep road he tailgates me. It's wet out, so for safety I drop into 2nd gear and leave it there for an average speed of 25mph on the 30mph road.

I figured making the jerk go slow was revenge enough... Until he passed me on the 4 lane bridge, and I realized he was an OnTrac delivery van. As quick as I could, I wrote his plate number on my hand, then called the number on the back of his van.

Mister_Xian,7,17,1npfvf,63,"  [pic, if you want instant gratification] (http://i.imgur.com/RBNbd4s.png?2)  

  During high school, there was a guy a grade below me, who we'll call Shin. Shin had always been very creepy towards girls, even in elementary school. He would touch a girl's chest or butt, and laugh childishly about it. This continued through high school.  

  His sophomore year, Shin would find drunk girls at parties, and grope them. It was well known that he was a creeper, but he was popular and ~~loud~~ funny, so it got shrugged off as acceptable. The summer after he graduated high school, Shin would sext girls, and send them dick-pics. Nobody wanted him at parties anymore, and girls stopped talking to him.  

  Shin went off to college, and became a frat boy, without a frat. He posted typical drunk pictures with cans of miller light in the background, and pictures of him golfing with his bros. The world moved on, and nobody from high school was around him. After he came back to his hometown, he started sexting girls again. A facebook friend of mine wasn't having any of it...  

  Rachael, we'll call her, exacted her petty revenge on Shin via facebook. She screenshot some of his daily texts to her, ranging from ""hey, what's good"" to ""you should come over, I just wanna fuck you"". What made it better was his ""look at my nerd/hipster raybans"" profile picture next to the raunchy texts. Rachael was gonna ruin Shin. She posted the picture on Shin's wall, which he deleted, and blocked her. Rachael posted it on her own wall, and called him out. She wrote that ""nobody wants his eggroll"" (he's Asian), and she's ""one cat you are not allowed to eat"". Nobody is allowed to talk to Rachael like that.  

  Shin was publicly humiliated, well over a hundred people had seen the post. Dozens of people commented, many of them girls Shin had also sexted. It was apparent how many girls he creeped on. Not even his best friends could defend him, commenting how funny it is to finally see someone call him out like this. He soon deleted his profile, and made another one. I haven't heard about the after-effects of the fiasco, but I imagine his social and dating life took a sizeable hit.

thatisreasonable2,46,80,1npfj3,284,"When I told her that I saw the measurement and it did qualify she turned into the rudest, bitchiest person and mocked me until I felt so ashamed.  She claimed that her company had *NEVER* lost a case and laughed telling me I could never prove it and I hung up on her.


The man the company had sent over (prior to my phone call to Ms. Bitch) had shown me how they test the bed: string across bed, pulled taut and then he measures the center.  I asked him what it measured and he told me 6"" and the paperwork I had on the bed stated 6"" so I knew it was defective.

After I'd talk to the bitch at the company and she'd mocked and laughed at me I got off the phone and dealt w/my feelings.  Then I remembered that the man who'd measured had given me his card.  We'd chatted up during his visit and he was a really nice young man.  So I called the number on the card and it was his Mother.  I guess they'd been doing this work for that bed company for a couple of years.  I told her about the bitch and her attitude and started crying cause she'd already told me that it was against policy for them to give me the results (I'd asked for them) and I knew that they would lose that company if it was found out she was even talking w/me.  I told her I didn't want that to happen and started to thank her and tell her how kind and professional her son had been and then she got real quiet.

When she spoke again she stated to me that she was going to give me documentation  AND that she was going to tell the company that she'd testify as to the defect and that the company had been pulling this shit for as long as they'd worked for them.  I couldn't believe her and thanked her from the bottom of my heart.
The following couple of days later, I get this call and that bitch?  The one from the company?  Was calling and I couldn't believe how 'sweet, concerned...."" she was acting.  She told me that the company was more than happy to replace the defective mattress.  I told her no thank you but I wanted a refund and didn't want to do any more business with them, ever.  I told her I was going to file a small claims case against them.

We went to small claims court.  We were in mediation and I presented the documentation to the mediator.  I also told him the story about how I'd been treated.  He looked at the representative of the mattress company and stated ""I think that you might strongly consider settling this as I don't think it would bode well for you to have this told to the Judge"".  They did.  

When they came to pick up the mattress and box springs (the deal had included a metal bed frame), they took off the mattress and as they were carrying it out to their truck I removed the bed skirt.  To my surprise, the metal frame had marked the box spring with a rust line and that in of itself would of voided my being able to return the bed, defect or not.  That was in the contract.

I looked at the guy as he's staring at it and he turns to me w/this look..........I couldn't describe it but I laughed and laughed and stated to him: Karma is such a bitch!  He just handed me my check and walked out.

I was $1200 richer and immediately went out and bought a really excellent bed from a really awesome company.  I've never done battle w/a company before and this truly was a moment for me.

So, like any decent person, I stopped and let the other woman pushing her cart through. She saw me move out of her way, but she didn't acknowledge me. 
Whatever, she was rude, but I'll survive. 
I followed her down the aisle and she stops right in front of the display where my daughter wanted to look. But she pushed her cart over what part her girth didn't already cover. My daughter and I waited patiently for her to move her ass and we talked about the dolls for a few minutes.
When she still hadn't moved and my daughter was getting impatient, we just walked to the next aisle. We stood there while my daughter was ooing and aweing over the McStuffins toys. She kept hugging the one doll she already owns, but, as we were getting ready to continue on down the aisle, here comes wide load and her trusty cart. So I position myself just as she had done in the previous aisle. My daughter in the cart hugging the lamb doll covering most of the grounds and me to the side covering this lady's target.

cak3isyummy,13,22,1npa15,96,"So, this happened last week or so.

I was driving on an interstate and it got pretty busy. The normal speed limit is 65 mph for cars and 55 mph for big trucks/semis so cars usually go anywhere around 70-80. It got so busy that all of traffic was going the same speed. There are two lanes that you can drive in, the fast/left lane or the slow/right lane. The semi drivers stayed in the slow lane which was nice because when traffic did start to pick up, nobody had to get held up in the left lane.

Now, I had been driving in the fast lane for the last twenty or so minutes following a pickup truck, no big deal I give them lots of space because tailgating is dangerous. The white car (wc) behind me was kind of close to me, but not too close, they left about one car length of space between us. Well I look up in my rearview mirror in time to see some jerk driver (jd) get into the slow lane and speed up and dangerously cut off wc. I say dangerous because if they had stayed in the slow lane, they would have rear ended the big semi in front of them, and if they had gotten in front of wc any sooner it would have been a big accident. There was (from what I could see) about only a few inches between the jd and both the wc and semi. Now this jd is tailgating me so bad that when traffic slowed down again, I honestly thought they were going to hit me.

I know that jd is just waiting for enough space in the slow lane to be able to pull around me. When that opening happens he, of course, pulls into the slow lane. Well at this point I'm pissed, I hate it when people think they can drive recklessly just to get ONE car ahead. (Seriously in the next 20 minutes the road will turn from two lanes to four.) So when he gets into the slow lane and starts to speed up, I speed up with him. He sees me and tries to go faster. He only had enough time to go around just me, if I was going to stay at the same speed that is, so when I sped up he wasn't able to. The car behind me sees what I have done and they speed up so he can't get back in front of them. So this guy gets stuck behind the next semi. I look back in the rear view mirror and notice that there were at least five more cars in the fast lane that he's going to have to wait for because now he's going to slowly to gain the momentum he needs to get into the fast lane.

This is why I drive in the fast lane and don't try to wrestle to be one car ahead. It usually just turns out to be faster *and* safer to just stay where you are, unless you're holding up traffic.",Don't drive recklessly,118

For $100 I'll let you feel my cock"" right as the train pulls up to our stop. We head out.

There was about two feet of slack in the rope that got tied so he could THINK he was getting off the train.. While he was walking, He shoved me (surprisingly hard) which was enough to knock me off balance (two of the guys caught me), while he reached the end of the slack and couldn't move.

Our management hadn't bothered to replace her for the time she was gone.

She comes in 30 minutes after everyone else (so she doesn't have to stress about getting kids to school, though she's not the only parent there), she gets easier lists of tasks to do, she's more likely to get someone else sent to help her, and nothing is ever said to her about going too slow or taking her breaks too late.

Two of my housemates were somewhat tidy, not quite up to my standards but hey, they made an effort. But one housemate was a total slob.

Last year my gf of 4 years broke up with me. I was devastated as it seemingly came out of nowhere but when I found out there was another guy in the mix it all made sense. I found out they were hooking up while we were still together and right after we broke up. soon after they became a couple. It really fucked me up mentally. I went into a deep depression, lost most of my appetite, drank almost everyday, started smoking heavily, using drugs heavily, hurting myself etc etc etc. It made going to uni and holding a job near impossible but somehow I managed to get through it.

Flash forward a few months. I'm in class with a few friends. First day of class I notice that my ex's new bf was in my class. I noticed that he always sat next to this one guy. I ignored focusing on him though because well I was there to learn. There was one week though where the friend of the bf was sitting in the row in front of me, one seat to my left. I happened to look back to the row behind me to talk to one of my friends and I saw the bf come into the auditorium. I assumed that he would sit next to his friend i.e. right in front of me so I put my feet up on the seat. 

I continue to talk to my friend and I feel him sit down and bump against my shoe. I hear him say excuse me so I moved my feet an inch or two but they were still on his seat. He then in a louder and angrier voice said ""Do you mind?""

I turned around to face him and I said ""I did move."" He stares at me for a few seconds with a confused look on his face until he realizes who I am. He mutters ""oh shit"" under shit breath, quickly gets up and then also quite loudly tells his friend ""yeah I'll just take this other seat next to you"" and moves further down the row.

Of course there are a million worse things that I'd love to do to him but it brought me great satisfaction to have made him move seats. Textbook petty revenge.",I did move.,418

uhohdynamo,4,18,1nmyok,79,"I actually like my job in retail for the most part.  It's easy, and as long as you work hard and keep it professional, even the store managers leave you alone and let you do your job.  I do best under low supervision, so in that aspect it's perfect.

Except for this one manager, we'll call him Joey.  Joey is not a high ranking manager; he's like a shade above a cashier.  Yet in every conceivable way is he more picky than our ""real"" managers, and criticizes you on things that literally district managers have never even said anything about...  I'd rather keep this short as my revenge is SUPER petty, so just know that he likes to micromanage employees, which is annoying as most of us can do our job autonomously and don't need to be bossed and criticized.

And of course, he has that awful tendency to do one of two things: 1) He has NO CLUE you're annoyed with him, and instead subconsciously reads that annoyance as ""I should boss this person more, they certainly need Manager Joey's criticisms!,"" or, 2) he notices they're annoyed at him barking orders, and gets really upset and tries to constantly apologize or explain why it's so important that they do this task and gets really needy.

Lately, any time he gives me some order, instead of just doing it like normal, I smile, say I'll get right on it, and slow my speed... by just about 10%.    Nothing noticeable at first, but that stacks every time he commands me.  Or, any time I need management for a situation that  I know is out of the ordinary, I'll do my best to call him instead of anyone else, because it's pretty fun seeing him get this ""I can do it!  Uhohdynamo's incompetence is no match for Joey!""  face, then hearing the situation and giving a blank stare like, ""Manager Joey is not trained to know this :(""

RD: Um hi I saw your ad on craigslist and was wondering when I could come in for an interview

Me: Oh well sir, honestly I wasnt aware of any such ad, Could you tell me what the position is for?

RD: It **Sayyys** you need a waiter and a manager.

Me. Sir, this is a mattress store.

RD: AND?

Me: We dont need waiters at a mattress store.

RD: It **says** you have a position that needs to be filled asap, Is there a manager I can talk to, not his secretary?

Me: Actually sir, I am the manager. I believe this is ll just a misunderstan-

RD: Listen, you are being sooo rude. Look at craigslist **Right Now**

Me: Im looking at it sir, and I dont-

RD: IT RIGHT THERE! How can you not see it? You deserve to loose your job!

And with that he hung up. Needless to say I was relieved and quite miffed that this man had the audacity to call me up and make it seem like I should pull a job out of my ass because some ass hat put down the wrong number in their ad.

stratovolcano,2,11,1nmqju,63,"So, I had a big lunch and long story short it was time to take a Donald Trump. I walked in to one of the three bathrooms in my house and got down to business. Not 30 seconds later my older sister is banging on the door, ""LET ME IN, I NEED TO DO MY HAIR!"" Obviously my reply is, ""I can't."" I thought the answer was obvious enough but apparently she needed to question me until I finally informed her that I was in the middle of a stinky affair. ""WELL HURRY UP, I'm going to the bar and I NEED to do my hair RIGHT NOW"". 

Yeah because you can't wait one more minute to go to the bar. Anyways I say sure, fine and she walks away.

Two minutes later she's banging on the door asking why it's taking so long. ""Almost done!"" She walks away again.

30 seconds later ""YOU'RE SO SELFISH STRATOVOLCANO I NEED TO DO MY HAIR HURRY UP YOU JERK"". So I reply ""I would be done already if you weren't bothering me!"". She leaves again.

Prestidigitalization,13,9,1nmeg9,57,"This is incredibly long, and I apologize for that.

I work as a ""manager in training"" at a somewhat local grocery store. There are 4 levels of employees: Customer Assistant, Team Lead, Assistant Store Manager, and Store Manager. I'm in-between a Customer Assistant (CA) and Team Lead (TL); basically, I'm a CA, so I can't actually *do* anything, but I'm training to be a TL, so I'm ""in the know"" about everything that goes on in management. Our Store Manager (SM) has a stupid idea about how the spreading of information works; he tells the Assistant Store Manager (ASM) or ONE TL very important, vital information, and expects it to be passed on to every single worker, both on and off the clock, within a few hours. Needless to say, this doesn't happen.

Ever since I started my training four months ago, I’ve had the displeasure to discover that our SM will regularly send group text messages to all of the TLs and myself (because I'm ""in-between"" and ""need to get used to it"") at five in the morning bitching about how ""such and such wasn't done right"". An example is, at 5:30 one morning, we all received a picture message of our meat section with the message ""I thought we talked about this!!! No more than 2 high or am I missing something? Also why would we put 2 product racks in front of the end cap??"" Half of us hadn't worked the day before, most of us hadn't been part of the ""we"", and he expected a response from everyone.

I know it probably doesn't seem that bad, but getting a text like that every other day at 5:30 in the morning really starts to get on a person's nerves, especially when it isn’t balanced with texts like, “We got waste down yesterday. Great job guys!” or “We made over $20,000 yesterday! Woo!” We always get negative texts about how we fucked up, but never any positive texts even if we work our asses off with two people calling out of their shifts and still managing to get everything done by close (which has happened). I digress.

The one unique thing about my store is that we mark items down to a lower price if they are a day away from expiring, that way we have a greater chance of selling it. My store manager changes the way we do these markdowns, both in order and in percentage, on a near-weekly basis, so it's a little bit difficult to keep up (especially because he will tell one person a new “policy change” and expect that it gets around). One week, after a ton of bickering with everyone, SM had the ASM write up a ""Markdown Sheet"" that basically told us what, when, and how much. That was all peachy for about a week, until word of more changes started getting around.

A month after this initial sheet was handed out, all of us had written and rewritten notes all over our personal copies in order to try and keep up with the constant changes. I would upload a picture for you guys, but it is a store-specific document, and I am the only in-between person at my store, so I can't risk it. Suffice to say that it was at least 50% original document, 50% handwritten changes. So, one morning at 9:00am, when I was snuggled up in bed with my boyfriend (I work the closing shift, so I normally sleep till 11:00am or noon), I get a group message from SM:

&gt;Can all of you tell me what we decided on the egg markdowns? I need a response from everyone.

I was (and am) sick and tired of the early-morning texts, so I ignored it. Eventually a TL answered the question incorrectly (this is important), but SM said it was absolutely correct, ""so why are we so off our waste budget?"" I ignore this and go into work later that afternoon for my shift. This is where it gets interesting.

I talked with the TL on duty that night about what had happened, and we decided that it would be beneficial to get a new print-out of the markdown guidelines. The TL decided he would ask, since he had more “power” as an official TL. He wrote back to the SM in the group conversation:

&gt;I think it would help if we got another set of guidelines printed out, and then they don’t change. It can be difficult to remember everything when it is all constantly changing.

The SM responded:

&gt; Well that sheet hasn’t changed except changes that u guys wanted for percentages so there no reason it shouldn’t be done. Those are just excuses and really at the end of the day won’t help our bonus.

The bonus he was referring to is the bonus that the Store Manager, and the Store Manager *only*, gets if our Markdown sale numbers are within a certain range. Somewhat irked that his bonus was now the main concern, we then sent the SM a copy of my horribly abused Markdown Sheet to help explain the changes we are referring to, and he responded with:

&gt; I don’t know what you’re trying to prove, but most of those notes don’t even make sense to me. I don’t know how long I am going to tolerate your guys lack of respect anymore.

He then sends *another* text to the TL telling him that, even if the TL wasn’t being disrespectful, he had to act like a dick in the group message or else the rest of the team wouldn’t respect him as a Store Manager because he wouldn’t be sticking up for himself. Exact. Words. So, TL and I are pissed. Like beyond pissed.

In the meantime the ASM sends us all a *separate* group message asking us how long he is going to have to hold our hands, why didn’t we ask questions if we had them in the first place, and why was I, an “in-between”, the only person “smart enough” to take notes. I decided to break away with this conversation and texted him back that everyone else had notes, too, and they were all different. We were just showing an example of what we were talking about. I then went on to explain that we were only requesting a new Markdown Sheet so that we would all be on the same page. I said this politely, calmly, and phrased as, “since you always say to come to you with questions and problems, this is a problem I’m seeing.” However, his response was:

&gt;We do have paper at the store. You really can’t rewrite what you need to do on a new piece of paper? Seriously??

Both the TL and I stopped talking to our SM and ASM, and we devised a plan. The TL would do both our jobs, which he’s managed to do before when people called out, and I would take as much time as needed to write up a brand-new copy of the Markdown Sheet. I spent *hours* on that puppy, and eventually had a packet of information, checklists, to-do sheets. You name it, I made it. And printed it. And printed it. And printed it. Oh, and remember how I mentioned that, in response to the original text, a TL had answered the question about egg markdowns incorrectly? Well, I made certain to put that misinformation in the packet since, you know, the SM said it was right. Anyway, I stuck the stack of packets in the break room with a sign stating that this was in no way official, that the information may be inaccurate, and to direct all questions about it to the SM and ASM.

These two have a spine over texts, but not in real life, so they just ignored the pile of packets. Occasionally they’d move them to a different location in the break room. Regardless, the packets started disappearing one by one. All the TL’s took them. Even the CAs took them. In fact, the only thing left in the break room now is the sign I posted over the original stack. I received compliments from all the TLs, in front of the SM and ASM, about how helpful it was and how awesome it was for me to help everyone get on the same page like that, even though I was just a lowest-level employee. The SM and ASM’s faces when they kept hearing that over and over… it felt *good*.

The best part is, about two days ago, the SM bitched to the TL (who originally helped me out) that my packet explained the dairy procedures wrong. However, I decided that I’m not changing a goddamn thing until the SM tells me, to my face, that the Markdown Packet that I created for the entire team has some incorrect information in it. To which I will reply that I will be more than happy to email him the original Word Documents.

He’ll never do it, though. Fucker.

So, that is my petty revenge. My actual revenge will be calling the Ethics Hotline tomorrow about them blatantly refusing to give me a lunch, or even a 10 minute break, during my 10 hour shift two days ago, even when I asked for one, and only ever giving me one 10 minute break during any given shift, whether it be five hours or nine; a clear violation of California State law. And also quitting the second I get a new job by not coming into work. (I’ve already told the TL’s this plan, and they’re more than happy to pick up a couple extra hours of work to see the SM and ASM squirm).

This is the type of place that has different sized rooms for different sized concerts, and there are alot of bartenders/ beer tub girls/ bottle service girls that come in just for those nights.

A group of them came down one time and kept ordering shots. One told me mine werent any good, and came behind the bar to make their own, after a bit of arguing I allowed her to make her own shots, but made sure she knew i was going to charge her, I rang them up on the same bill as her food tab was on.  She was horrified when I handed her the bill, demanding the employee discount.  I reminded her that it doesnt cover booze, and the food discount was for before/after shifts.

Antigon35,232,1617,1nmb5m,2487,"So a friend of mine, we’ll call him Daniel, is deaf and has been his whole life. Daniel was fired from his job by a manager that openly mocked him for being deaf. So when he needed to go to the unemployment office he asked me to go with him because I have been trying to learn sign language and we can communicate pretty well. We get there and there’s only us and a very elderly old man (EM) sitting in the waiting area. All of the chairs are set up so that we are facing the only receptionist in the room. There seems to be some sort of issue with EM’s paperwork so every few minutes EM would walk up to answer a question of the receptionists’ or to sign what she asked him to sign and then he would sit back down. Daniel being the sweet guy he is, would reach forward and hold the man’s chair every time he went to sit back down. 

So me and Daniel are signing back and forth just shooting the shit when a few other people come in, including a very loud, obnoxious, white trash couple. Now, as I previously stated, I am just learning sign language so I was concentrating on what I was signing and understanding what Daniel was signing so at first I didn’t notice white trash couple plop down in the seats behind us. Then I heard it “derrr… derrr… I’m a deafie….derr”. I glance behind me without moving my head and in my peripheral vision I can see white trash male mocking Daniel and imitating the noises that Daniel makes when he laughs or gets into a story. White Trash bitch apparently thinks this is hilarious. I realize that because I am super concentrating, I haven’t said anything or given them any idea that I am not deaf.  I take a look at the receptionist who looks mortified but seems not to know what to do. 

Now nothing would have made me happier than to cause a huge scene but I knew Daniel was already self conscious about getting fired so I did the next best thing. I waited until EM went to sit down again, Daniel reached forward to hold his chair, I spun around in my chair, looked white trashy 1 &amp; 2 and yelled as loud as I could “WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM!?!” White Trash douche’s jaw drops in shock and the bitch went white as a sheet. I just stared at them. Daniel suddenly realizes I am looking at the white trash couple and signs “What’s wrong?” I told him they kicked my chair. He signs “Asshole” and glares at them. 

I guess they felt uncomfortable enough that they decided to slink out of the building. Fuck you and your unemployment check.  

Edit 1: Concerning the amount of posts regarding legal action against Daniel's workplace, At the time Daniel couldn't prove that he had been fired for his disability. The Manager claimed it was for him being lazy and tried to say that Daniel had drawn a penis on the white board in the back that he sometimes used to communicate (which he hadn't). So Daniel went for unemployment while his friends back at his job pulled some strings. I want to get Daniel to post his revenge story for getting his job back b/c I don't think I could do it justice. It's pretty great.

silverfiresong,21,55,1nm4yj,239,"I was riding the bus today with my backpack on my lap to make room for someone else to sit (like any decent person would). A young couple gets on and the guy sits beside me and says ""Come sit on my lap baby."" This was a little guy, telling his not so little girlfriend to cuddle on the seat next to me on the bus. I give him a politely puzzled look, because there is an open seat directly in front of us but he doesn't pay any attention to me. As she's lowering herself into boyfriend's lap, her pants are falling down and all I see is 'nude' colored underwear with the tags sticking out and some ass crack extending past the panties.

Neither the visibility nor seeing the names prevented one employee from pilfering food from other people's lunches, and sometimes the entire lunch.

The problem arises when there's a new employee or a customer parking in the lot and they don't know 'the rules'. Yesterday a car no one recognized parked behind me and blocked me in for 20 minutes. The car description was paged over our company-wide intercom and I even went so far as to take a photo of the car and go from employee to employee asking if they could identify this vehicle. No one could.

As I said, 20 minutes later a random customer realizes we've been describing her car in the page. She finally hoofs her ass out to the parking lot, with me right behind her (I'd really like to go home now). Because she was a customer I couldn't really say anything rude. So when she apologized I simply grunted and kept a slightly scary and maniacal smile on my face while following her creepily close out to her car (we're both female). Although when did try to apologize once again best I could manage was more grunting and maniacal smiling.

Customer moved her vehicle and I never looked her in the eye or spoke to her. But I smiled the whole time, giving her the serious creeps. Hopefully she learned her lesson and will be a little more respectful in the future.",Double stacked parking nightmare,10
TheSilverNoble,26,73,1nl0yv,350,"X-Posted from a comment in TFR. 

Three people came into our restaurant and asked about getting a job there. We were out of applications, as we were not actively hiring, but I told them I would get their information down and pass it along in case something opened up.So they write their stuff down on a piece of paper, I take it to the office, and I bring out their food. 

One girl complained about all her food- but not to me. I would come by and ask about how everything was, and she would kinda look into her food and mumble about how bad it was. It's not the best restaurant by any means sometimes people don't like the food- but talk to me like a fucking adult. And hell, if you just asked for a job, maybe you should pretend like you really like food. And she did this every time I came to the table. She cancelled her dessert, saying something about how she was afraid. 

And then it comes time to pay. The other girl offered to pay for all three of them, gave me her card, then both girls went outside to the car. I run her card and it is declined. I expect her to come right back in- since she would have to sign the receipt and everything- but several minutes pass and she does not return. I go to the guy at her table and tell him to tell her it was declined when she comes back. He tells me to take the first girl's food off and only run hers. 

I am uncomfortable doing this. I don't like changing credit card information on someone else's say so, even if it's lowering the charges. It's probably fine, but it bothers me. I told him I could not, that it was a legal thing, and he seemed vaguely offended. 

I waited and she didn't come back in. I went outside, found her, and told her it wad declined. Both the girls came back in, split their food up ($50 total) and paid. 

Neither one tipped.

She is a neat freak and hoarder, she keeps paper boxes soaps and toothpaste came with, empty deodorant cans and powder bottles stacked in a corner. I thought she was recycling or something but i found out those garbage has been in her room for years. 90% of the room is full of her stuff, the only thing I have in there is my bed and small cabinet. She even got fucking mad when I told her I was gonna buy a bigger one since Im running out of room for my clothes and things. 
At night when im about to doze off, she comes in the room and makes her bed. She hits her pillows together, shakes out her blanket, then she takes some folded clothes out of her drawer and re-fold it. This routine takes her about 20 min. to finish. Ive tried talking to her about these things but she wont listen to me. Another thing that pisses me off is after shes done making her bed, she leaves the fucking lights on and door open like theres no one trying to sleep in the room. 

A week ago, I told her 'pls close the door on your way out' but she just ignored me. wtf. Shes making me get up and shut it myself. Im sure you all know how frustrating it feels to get up when youre already so comfortable in bed. 
Im so fed up so I peed in the toilet and wiped using her fucking blanket. Actually I sat on her bed and kind of jumped a couple of times. 

This afternoon she pissed me off again by being a bitch who hides the bathroom rug. She said she put it on the balcony, I told her to please get it for me and she walked away. She didnt come back so I got out of the bathroom (we dont have carpets) and dried my feet by stomping on her bed.

ForTheTwoofus,7,14,1nkcfz,28,"The backstory to this one starts about 4 years ago when I was in high school. My girlfriend at the time was pretty close with her older cousin, who would drink quite often and bring her along when he could. I never really had a problem with it, only a couple sketchy nights, but for some reason when my ex, I'll call her 'Eve', came home telling me she met her cousins friend 'Adam' and how funny he was, something didn't feel right. Especially knowing she's a cheap and easy drunk. A few months and a few mentions of his name go by, and now it's Eve's birthday. Her and some girlfriends are going to drink at a friends place, and who else is getting them booze but the cousin and Adam. She promises he won't be staying, yadda yadda, they sleep together that night. Details are still unclear because she was completely wasted and can barely remember, but shit happened and they partied naked. Well that was the end of me and Eve. We had been on the rocks for some time but this was definitely the straw to break the camels back. Adam and Eve eventually get together, we all move on, end of story. Or so I thought. 

Four years later I'm working at a family run pretzel/pizza shop for my summer job. I'm just doing my regular thing not thinking about Adam and/or Eve whatsoever, when in they walk for a nice 9"" pepperoni pizza. Now, this place is goddamn hot. All the time. Tiny building + big oven = sweaty working conditions. I'm a big warm guy already though so I know how to deal with sweat and heat. But unfortunately, yes, sometimes a drip or two will get away from me and even hit the food. When I see this I'll usually scrap it and start again. But oh no not this time. I let it drip today. At least 4 fat drops of sweat landed on their nicely arranged pepperoni. Take that ya cheats. Then as an extra flip of the bird I only put the shitty cheese on their pizza and not the good shit we usually use for the second layer.

etabaje,5,9,1nk3mb,37,"I am on the programming team on my high school's robotics team. My school is a pretty expensive private high school, and most of the students there are quite wealthy. Luckily, most of them are really incredibly nice as well. There is one individual in particular who everyone kind of dislikes, let's call him AG (annoying guy), and he is also in robotics, in the programming section (since robotics is no cut). He is generally douchey, has an ""I'm better than you"" attitude, and is generally also not very smart. Personally, I write the code that controls the robot, including converting the joystick input to the RPM the motors will spin at. I have it set up so that the fastest the robot goes is about 1/2 of its potential. Now, AG was up to be testing out his driving skills, so I decided to have a bit of fun. I changed the code so that the robot moves twice as fast, but only when I press a button on my joysticks (we have 4 total, with the left 2 set up to drive it like a tank, and the left two are on AG's side, and the other two are on mine). AG and I were the only two out there, so I pushed the code to the robot and let him drive it. He wasn't that bad driving, although most of the people there were far better. As he was nearing a wall, about to turn, I quietly pressed the speed toggle, and the robot was shunted forward. I toggled the speed down again, and AG desperately tried to slow down, but since the robot weighs over 110 lbs (about 49.8 kg), it accumulated quite a bit of momentum, and smashed into the wall and toppled over. I quickly reverted the changes in the code and put them back on the robot, so no one would wonder what was going on.

A little bit of background: My sister and I have never gotten along. It's been a little better now as we've gotten older, but she often still annoys the shit out of me. She still steals my stuff, is blatantly rude and disrespectful to our parents, is loud, crude, and annoying, and often has her friends over in huge groups and they make a TON of noise. This story is just one of many that's made me hate her.

The story: Last weekend I went home (I'm a college student and my house is about 20 minutes away by bus) for a D&amp;D game with some of my friends. I brought my dice with me, which I've had for YEARS. I always use them and my sister knows this (sometimes she plays with us - not this time though). I had them in a clear plastic bag on my floor when she walks by my room and sees them. Immediately she claims that they're hers and that one of our cousins gave them to her for Christmas or something. Now this is utter bullshit. There is no doubt that these dice are mine. I bought them from a gaming store that's now closed and I love them. I tell her to fuck off. Later, I notice they've disappeared and so I raid her room while she's out with a friend and I find them in her desk. 

The revenge: I own a pet snake that's about 1.5 feet long and about the width of a quarter. She eats mice that are roughly the size of my thumb and need to be defrosted in warm water prior to consumption. Well, my sister has this mug with the cast of Hetalia on it (she's a total weaboo). It's her favorite mug, so naturally I choose it to defrost the mouse for a good ten minutes or so. I also use her favorite chopsticks to give the mouse to my snake. Afterwards, I make tea with the mousewater and give it to her as a ""peace offering."" Take that, bitch.

kestert,182,328,1njzho,1172,"I'm a part time single parent with 50% care of my kid.

When my ex got pregnant I stayed at home with the kid **during the day** and worked evenings ~~during the day~~ so she could graduate as a doctor. When she did graduate, she broke up with me.

We did have had a private arrangement where she was meant to pay child support (due to her earning 6 or 7 times more than me). But she has been paying it very irregularly and a much lesser amount than we agreed.

Last year I brought the matter up with her and pointed out that the rate we agreed on was less than I was legally entitled to and I'd like her to pay our agreed rate but I could get the full rate enforced by my country's Child Support Agency (CSA).

She took that as an outrageous threat and told me I just could not make threats like that! And as she told it the fact is she simply couldn't afford the rate they were suggesting.

So a month ago she bought a new car and last week she went off on a month long holiday to Europe but didn't tell me that she was going. I was blindly sending her texts asking for her to pack stuff for my daughter for the change over that it turns out she won't receive until she gets back.

So I just went ahead and organised with the CSA for them to start collecting the money. They will attempt to phone her at work and write to her home address but if they don't hear from her they will start billing her and fine her if she doesn't pay within 7 days beginning from last Monday.

I honestly would have preferred a private arrangement, and would have been happy to accept a lesser amount as long as it was consistently paid. But I didn't want to ""threaten"" her again.

[deleted],10,25,1njpm5,45,"This is my first ever thread post on reddit, and it was either here or /r/trees. Figured you guys would get a kick.

Five years ago, I had just graduated high school. I had a pocketful of money, lungs full of smoke, and a car full of friends. Our mission? To find more combustibles to pack ever-so-deliciously into my brand new glass bowl. Well, after a few hours of text-tag and facebook hunting, a friend recommended a friend who knew a guy. By this point, its just me and my buddy left now, its getting late, and we drive off to do our thing and receive our trees. 

Now, guy we meet is a a wannabe thug from our school who had been kicked out a few years before for some silly thing or another, but despite this we decided to play it cool and chill with him for a bit before leaving. Things were going swell, we were all toasted, he hands me the bag and I hand him the cash. He pauses, asks if he can toke up in his car real quick with my bowl (mind you, the very first bowl I ever bought). I agreed and....as you can guess, while we were high and debating whether to listen to reggae or hip hop, guy drove off with me bowl.
Oh and whats this? The trees you sold us is a bag of stems and seeds with no real weed in there? You scoundrel sir!


Anyways, fast forward to present day. Today, actually. I've been broke for a while and unemployed, but my old boss called and said they had screwed up on a paycheck from February and had a check for sixty some dollars for me. I go and pick it up, cash it, and grab twenty bucks to go invest in some head-itation. I do a near identical routine to that of five years ago, until someone finally tells me to come to a buddies house.

I pull in the driveway, saunter up to the door, walk into a cloud of skunky smoke, and have to immediately double take. For there, on the couch, is the same guy that jacked my money and bowl five years ago. Turns out, he's the owner, and he's about as drunk as you can get at 3 in the afternoon, and is still smoking bongs like Tommy Chong. I bicker with his buddy for a bit, and get what I came for. I nod to the thief on the couch and ask if he remembers me. He shakes his head while hitting the bong, passes it to me, and asks if I used to be his sister's boyfriend. I follow suit and shake my head while hitting the bong, and when he turns to his buddy to ask a question, I quickly hit it a second time.

This little gimmick goes on for about thirty minutes, with the drunk thief packing bowl after bowl of his precious Colorado stash (we live nowhere near CO), and every time he passes it to me, I'm hitting it several times before passing back (Best was he gave me greens, I scoobed the whole bowl in two hits and told him he didn't pack enough).

Finally, I get tired and stand to leave, figuring that I've snatched enough smoke from this guy to make up for his shenanigans from so many years ago. I go to the door to put on my shoes, and THERE IS MY BOWL SITTING IN A WICKER BASKET FULL OF BOWLS.
This was the very first bowl I had ever boughten, one I had spent days picking out, shopping around for, until this particular specimen had caught my eye- and it was a live and well in this guy's house. 
I couldn't help myself, I picked it up and pointed it out, asked him where he got it (he lied, I think, and said something completely unintelligible). I smirked, and asked him if I could hotbox the car real quick with it, saying ""I don't keep a bowl in my car but I like to drive with the smell in the air vents"". It sounded dumb to my own ears, but drunk thief dismissively waved his hands at me, saying to go ahead- AND THEN GAVE ME A NUG TO USE.

I'm posting this in the McDonald's bathroom down the road as I shred his nug and pack up my long-separated first born. I dont even smoke in my car anymore. Haha

**Backround**

I work at a large bank, and very recently we had a rather large layoff in my division of the company. Due to press releases we knew this was coming, and many people that should have been let go ages back, were finally released back into the local workforce. I’m sure some of the people didn’t deserve it, but so is the life in this industry. We’re just as subject to supply and demand for the services we provide as customers are for pricing on products.

During the day layoffs were announced, one of my better team mates (Cool Guy, or CG) was on a planned vacation for a week, and he missed the news. The company handled everything extremely respectfully, and we were notified in a very controlled manner (read: in small groups with our VP). 

Also, at this time, one of my friends at this place of work was out on disability. There was a horrible accident involving her and a dog, that ended up with her foot turned around backwards at the end of her leg. I’ve been in contact with her this entire time, seeing her about once every 3 weeks (we’ll call her SS1). She’s been through several surgeries, and they even found another issue that could have killed her in the mean time. Everything is good now.

There is a BubbleHead (BH) who works on the team seated next to ours. When CG came back from vacation on the day he said he would, he hadn’t even set his stuff down on his own desk, before BH was blabbing the news to him, in the most heartless gossipy way (and BH is a guy, he reminds me of Mr. Mackey from South Park, except not funny), *“Hey did you hear what happened while you were out?!? They let a bunch of people go and SS1 and SS2 were on the list!”*

He basically eschewed all manners and company protocol for handling the situation correctly, the inconsiderate bastard. Later on CG told me how he heard the news and I then understood why CG’s mood was crappy all that day. (Edit: CG is also good friends with SS2)

**Revenge**

As I said above, I’ve been in touch with SS1 the entire time, and I went straight to her with the details that BH had let fly, I felt that if anyone should know, it should be the person that this heinous rumor was about. She followed up with her boss immediately, and found out that she was not affected. 

SS1 is coming back to work in two weeks. I’m not telling anyone at work except one person whose confidence I can trust. I can’t wait to see the look on his face when he realizes just how wrong he is/was.

Frogel,30,100,1niypp,272,"I bike a lot in a major city, so I see a lot of dick moves by people who think they can get away with it. Littering, yelling at me, ignoring traffic signals; it can get frustrating.

One beautiful day, I am stopped behind a minivan at a stoplight. Driver has her window open, and a cigarette dangling out. When the light turns green, she takes one more drag, then *tosses it out the window*. Aw, I can't let that happen.

There is no one behind me. I stop, carefully pick up the cigarette butt, and pedal like hell to catch up. She stopped at a traffic light 2 blocks from the first one.

""Excuse me ma'am!"" I yell at her through her now-closed window to get her attention. She's flustered, like most people are when you talk to them in their cars. ""Excuse me!""

Success! She opens her window. ""Yes?""

""I think you dropped this,"" I say with my look-how-helpful-I-am smile. I hold out her recently discarded cigarette butt.

She slowly realizes what is going on. ""No, I, uh, what, nh, no thank you,"" she says.

The light has just turned green, so she pulls off, thinking she's away from the situation. But no! We're in a city, and the next light is red too.

""You sure you don't want it back?"" I say as I offer it again at the next light, still smiling.

I now notice the passenger in the minivan, who is laughing at the driver. Driver lady gives me the finger, and drives off.

Not as much justice as I would've liked (tossing a burning ember in the car would've been too much) but it was nice.

And yes, I disposed of the butt properly.

binger5,6,28,1niy36,43,"I went to college with a few of my best friends from high school. I was roommate with the Computer Science Major(CSM), and 2 of our close friends were roommates in the same apartment complex. Let's call them Business Major(BM) and Advertising Major (AM). Needless to say we hung out a lot during college. Roughly once a week we would go to the other person's apartment for dinner. 

Most of the times it turned out well. Sometimes dinner was a little off, and we would end up ordering pizza. One time BM made fish for dinner. A couple of us waited tables at a local seafood house during senior year in high school. As we learned how to cook, a we experimented fish sometimes. 

AM saw what was for dinner that night and said, ""Man, you're really testing my patience for fish."" He had a douchy smile. My roommate CSM laughed and I cracked a smile. BM wasn't the confrontational type, and he didn't say anything. When I looked over and I could tell he was hurt by the AM's snarky remark. Little did I know he was brewing his revenge.

A month later the four of us were having dinner again. CSM and I were in the living room playing video game and bullshitting while BM was cooking. AM was in his room doing his own thing. When BM finished he motioned for CSM and myself to come over. You see he cooked just enough for the three of us. We each got a plate of food and started eating. 

Sure enough AM comes out of his room 5 minutes later. He goes into the kitchen grabbed a plate. He looked around and realized that there was nothing left. ""Sorry I didn't make you any,"" BM said. ""Didn't want to test your patience."" AM was pissed and went back into his room to sulk. 

Later on that night we went to watch a movie. AM and I were walking ahead of CSM and BM. I found an empty row in the middle and sat in the middle. AM followed me. CSM and BM sat a couple of rows back. Those fuckers. The preview comes on. I look over and see AM pull out a KitKat bar from his pockets. 

""Ummm, you're not suppose to sneak food into the theater, "" I joked. 

""It's my dinner,"" AM said as he stared at me. The rest of that movie was super uncomfortable. ",You're testing my patience.,71

I used to work at a members-only bulk warehouse, the bigger brother to White-Trash Mart.  My job was in the meat department- helping the butchers (washing and cleaning tables, saws, knives), prepping &amp; cooking rotisserie chickens, stocking the counter with steaks, chops, seafood, etc.  I enjoyed the job, the coworkers were great, the butchers were hilarious, and I did what I could to keep the customers happy.  Most of the time. 
One day a gentleman came up to me and said “I want to buy box of crab legs.” 
Cool.  We do that.  A box cost something like $100, so I was more than happy to help this guy out.  I should explain the setup of our area first.  Immediately behind me was the rotisserie oven and the meat cooler.  The meat cooler included the butcher tables, sinks, and a storage cooler.  The storage cooler was where we kept most of our product- pork, beef, chicken, boxes of salmon and other fish.    
About 50 yards away was the dairy cooler.  I only mention it because attached to it is our deep freezer.  Kept at a brisk -10° F, this is where the crab legs, lobster, shrimp and other seafood are kept along with the rest of the meat before it gets moved to the cooler to thaw.    Anyway, so this customer says “I want to buy box of crab legs.”  Imagine it’s said with a heavy Polish accent (this has no importance to the story, but he was Polish).
I reply, “No problem, let me go grab one from the freezer for you.” as I point toward the deep freezer.  Here’s where it gets good.  He says “No, crab legs are kept there. I know this.” pointing to the meet cooler/butcher area. 
Me, still being pleasant: “I’m sorry, but the crab legs are kept in the freezer over there.” Pointing, again.  “If you’ll let me-”
Customer, becoming curt:  “No, crab legs are in there.  You go get box for me now.”
Now I’m thinking- “OK, I’ll play this game…”  I walk into the prep area and then into the storage cooler.  I sit down on a box of ribs play a quick game of Brick Breaker or whatever the heck the Blackberry game is called.  After a few minutes I walk back out empty handed.  “I’m sorry, but we don’t have any more crab legs in the cooler.”  He looks disappointed, but thanks me and goes on his way. 
I smile to myself, knowing that he won’t get to have crab with dinner since he was being stubborn about where it was being stored.
TL;DR:  I don’t walk up to you and tell you where you keep your silverware (edit: for example), don’t come up to me and tell me where we keep our product.",We don’t keep frozen product in the refrigerator (x-post from /r/talesfromretail),116

I have regularly participated in martial arts for the past 8 years. Started in high school, got me through college, and now I'm still at it in the professional world. I love every class and would recommend everyone try it at some point, regardless of style.

Anyway, I digress. I would often attend a lunch class held at the school. This was a great class because it was smaller so I would get more 1 on 1 help. This is where I was driving to at the beginning of my story.

Enter douchbag (D). I was on a two lane parkway about to exit to the road where my school is located. Out of nowhere, D cuts me off from the left lane to make the exit. He almost clipped me. As I laid into my horn D shot me the finger and brake checked me pretty bad (I had an older car at the time and had to swerve off to avoid hitting him). 

Anyway, I brushed the incident off and continued to make my way to the class. But that is when I saw D in front of me. He seemed to be making the same turns I was. It wasn't until he pulled into the parking lot and got out that it occurred to me... He's in my class!!! And must be new!! (Didn't recognize him).

As I got out of the car a few cars away, D gave me the look of ""you wanna go!?!?"" That was until he saw me completely get out. You see, before you reach black belt at my school, you have a white uniform, like the one he was wearing. When you reach black belt, you may also wear a black one. Well I was a 2nd degree at the the time, and my uniform was a nicely faded grey - a sign I had been there a while. 

D noticed my uniform and the greatest oh shit face descended upon him. I just laughed and went past him into the school. 

Now I know what you're thinking... I kicked his ass right?? Well no, I didn't. But he did puke from doing bag work with me, and I threw him around like a rag doll during sparring.

Bunkadin,86,375,1nhsqb,1443,"First post, please be kind.

I hope this qualifies,

I work for &lt;big satellite tv company&gt; doing residential installs for satellite tv. Several months ago I did an install at a duplex in a small town for a nice Filipino Lady (Now FL). She told me how happy she was to be in Canada and how her husband had worked for several years to bring her and their family (4  young children) into the country. These things made me happy and eager to help her. I proceed with my install.

Problem:
On the side of the building, there is already a dish mounted, and the landlords will not permit me to mount an additional dish. However I can use the existing dish as it is the same brand and there are free ports on it.

So I run my cable and hook up her receiver to the existing dish, which belongs to her neighbor, Racist Bugger. Who from here on shall be known as RB.

Everything works out well and when I leave the whole family is crowded around the television changing the channels excitedly. I leave with a smile on my face.

About 45 minutes after I leave I get a phone call on my work cell. 

FL: *crying* Someone cut our cable! Please come back and fix it!

Me: Sure, no problem.
(shortened, obviously)


I get back to her house and the brand new cable I had just ran is cut clean in the middle and is lying loose. I ask FL if she had cut it and she had no idea what had happened. 

So I decided to inquire with her neighbor.

Me: Hello, do you know anything about this cable?

RB: WHY IS THAT HOOKED UP TO MY SATELLITE! THAT *racial expletive* CAN'T DO THAT! *rude words and angryness ensues*

Me: Okay, but *explains situation* there can be only one dish.

RB: TO BAD! SHE CAN'T USE MINE! *more racial expletives but you get the drift*

Me: Okay.

RB goes inside his house so I calmly walk over to the dish, remove his cables and the entire assembly. I then mount her dish in the exact same spot and cut his cables just to short to reach.  

At this point RB comes out and starts raging at me to hook his tv back up. So I calmly explain to him that I got permission from the Landlord to supply FL with the service, and as that is the only dish that they will allow, he will have to ask FL if she will let him use her dish. 

I smile and leave.

All the other concert goers around us were very friendly and chill, fitting with the environment, except for this one drunk girl who (surprise) didn't listen to the band.  She got mad anytime anyone touched her, which was frankly ridiculous because we were all right near the front.  Anyway, one of my friends accidentally stepped on her foot and turned around to apologize.  The crazy girl overreacted and threw her beer on my friend!  Instant enemy.  Literally everyone around her was annoyed by her the rest of the night.

so0ks,4,18,1nhjhu,82,"This isn't wholly of my own devices, I'd never gotten the opportunity to pull this until tonight. I work at a local burger joint in an uppity part of Chicagoland. The owners of the restaurant, despite not being around much, decided I'm perfect for running drive thru. Having never run drive, I get the crash course. The big problem with this is that I don't hear very well. All the other employees and managers are pretty aware that they may have to repeat themselves a few times, so putting me on drive really sucks. I've had the headset on quite a bit before this, which is how I knew I'd be in for a hard time. Turning up the volume isn't really an option as then all sounds from my end, my voice and the other employees' feels like God booming down my ear drum.

This guy pulls up, and I start to take his order. He's absolutely awful to me from the get-go, but I keep trucking and stay polite. He starts fussing about the condiments, and I explain, several times, that everything is made to order so he can have whatever. I think he may have actually been confusing us with another burger place. He's rude and short with me and begins to get more irate the more that I ask him to please speak the fuck up. Then he starts shouting, going off on a tirade about how he never gets enough mustard. I suddenly get a devious idea. Having been a baker and worked in a deli, I would never fuck with someone's food in a harmful way, but I will in other ways. Ask me for a little ice rudely, one cube kinda stuff. So halfway through his rant, each time he mentions extra mustard, I hit the mustard button. There was probably five extra or so. Now one of my buds down the line pops his head out from the kitchen to shoot me a look after hearing all this over the kitchen's intercom and I give him a thumbs up. He nods, laughing and goes to mustard the shit out of this burger.

Otadiz,20,23,1nh6tl,56,"Oh do I have a revenge story for you Reddit, but first I need to dive into some back story so it all makes sense, the reasoning for my revenge.  Originally it was just between my friend and his boss, but later involved me which was a big mistake and I am not a man to be fucked with.


So my friend and his boss had known each other for 15 some odd years and throughout this time all the boss ever did was ask my friend for translating help.  See, this BOSS is actually a foreign, rich man, who was sent over here to learn English and better himself in good 'ol America.


He has money, LOTS of money, so he thinks he can be a douche and get away with it, not happening Pokey, but more on that later.  So Bossman contacts my friend and offers him a job in another state from where he currently was.  It has better pay, work conditions, and he's going to be a manager.  Uh Yah, sign us up!  The one condition was that the business plan would have to approved for franchising.  My friend wrote the plan and it was approved.  Venture Capitalism here we go!


Everything is going well and pay is good.  $500 a week actually, an agreement for a vehicle and monthly payments, and it's just a positive situation for all involved.  However, months go by and Bossman changes, he starts to overwork my friend.  My friend tells him that he needs to go easy on him and give him some breaks, but he doesn't listen.  My friend has a stroke and gets hospitalized for a week.


We lose our apartment and end up in a shit-hole. We ended up stuck for 3 years while trying to rebuild our lives.  But it doesn't end there, in response to my friend being overworked, Bossman cuts his hours, his pay, and his title.  He went from $500/wk salary to $9/hr and barely 30 hrs a week and was henceforth known as a GLORIFIED CASHIER.  He could no longer afford to make those car payments and Bossman knew it, he said nothing, he let him keep using the car.


Throughout the next 3 years my friend put up with harassment in various forms for orientation, age, and health.  He was mocked and ridiculed, called stupid, overworked, and treated like crap.  His checks were also garnished for items that were broken/stolen on his shift, that he is not responsible for.


My friend even wrote a SECOND business plan for another store to be franchised for Bossman, which was ALSO approved.


After the 3 year period my friend gets a challenge from Bossman to find a new job but that he couldn't because he was too old and stupid.  Little did Bossman know, but that my friend was given a personal recommendation by the police captain of the city and from this recommendation, got a new job.


When Bossman found out, he was FURIOUS.  He could no longer dictate my friend's income level to make he and I suffer, nor could he boss him around.  They had an agreement to have him work a schedule between the two stores until transfer period had taken hold but as expected, Bossman broke it and promptly fired my friend, illegally might I add.


Remember that car? Well now Bossman wants it back and is being a jerk about it, tries to get the police involved but it's not stolen because he entered into an agreement with us, and under the law, it's not stolen.  This makes Bossman even ANGRIER.  He threatens to come and get the car and take no prisoners.  He can't find us, we moved and didn't tell him the new address.  After a week of ranting, he shuts up and goes away for a bit.


My friend's SSI finaly came in and Bossman wanted to strike a deal about payments on the car, however given the past experience and all other broken promises, I tell my friend that it would be VERY unwise to trust him any farther and just hold out until we can get a newer, better, vehicle.


Fast forward a few months and we finally get a new car, so Bossman can have his piece of shit back and we can FINALLY be done with him.  My friend was just going to drive the car back to him, he lives 40 some odd minutes away from us.  I told my friend, nah I have a better idea.


Now we get to the good part, the revenge.

1. Bossman lives some 40 odd minutes away.
2. Bossman REALLY wants his car back because he's pissed off he can no longer boss my friend around and dictate his income.  He has control issues for some odd reason, probably because he's one of those rich assholes.
3. There's an abandoned parking lot a few miles away from our home.
4. The tags aren't current on the car.


The idea is born;

I tell my friend to park his car in the abandoned lot, lock it, drain the gas, and drop the key behind one of the tires.  I will then text the GPS COORDINATES not the address, to Bossman and tell him where he can pick up his car.  I told him that he needs to hurry before it is towed/stolen, he will have to put gas in it, and that the key is behind one of the tires.


Bossman is even more pissed, doesn't understand why would we do this, says that he is going to ""have a talk"" with us in the morning about it face to face.  I told him, ""You step 1 foot on my doorstep, I will have you arrested and hauled away for trespassing.""  He tells me he doesn't understand GPS.  I told him to drop it in Google, he gets frustrated.  I tell him, ""Not my problem and perhaps you should have treated my friend with more respect and not been a dickbag.""  I also told him, ""You are lucky we do not sue your ass into the ground and take that store out from under you.  You might be able to get away with that shit in your country, but this is America and that is illegal bub and as far as I'm concerned, I'm letting you off easy.""


Bossman never showed up.

When he recovers from his mishap, I am just going through the other door.

One of the places I stop by to grab lunch at employs a man who I believe may have some form of autism.  He doesn’t make eye contact or show much facial expression and is a little slow when it comes to entering your order but he is a very diligent worker(DW) and if he makes a mistake, he fixes it and apologizes.  This isn’t a problem for me since I can come and go to work as I please but today I had the most impatient, heinous cunt(HC) standing in line behind me.

She was on her phone complaining about how long it was taking to get through the line to whoever was on the other end.  It started off with the usual huffing and bitching but then the nasty remarks about the cashier spewed out.  HC was just loud enough that I could barely overhear her.  It was that hissed kind of whispering that people do when they really don’t want to be overheard.  Unfortunately for her, I overheard right as she said that the retard was taking too long.  I am not a confrontational person but I turned around and stared right at her until she gave me a withering look more said, “What? It slipped.”

I turned around and got called to a second register to place my order.  DW was unfortunate enough to take HC’s order.  She was off the phone and placed it and her oversized purse on the counter next to me.   As I picked up my to-go order, I deliberately turned and let my bag hit her belongings hard enough to knock them to the floor.  She looked livid but didn’t say a word as she went to pick her things up.

What she didn’t realize was that as her precious belongings were falling to the floor, I let out a silent fart that I’d been holding in since walking inside.  Her face as she encountered the invisible cloud of stink was priceless.  And my words to her?

The Place: Boy Scout Camp in Wyoming
The Victim: Me

In 2005, I was asked by the Scoutmaster of the troop to which my sons belonged to accompany them to Camp for the week. I love camping, and any time I can go with my sons, I do it. Also, the BSA requires that there be at least two adult leaders at all times, for youth protection. Naturally, I agreed. It was great fun, and the area around Yellowstone Park, where the camp is located, is beautiful.

I also like firearms, and am somewhat of an enthusiast. I am by no means the best marksman in the world, but I do OK. 

All that leads to this: while at the camp, our troop reserved the rifle range for a troop shoot, meaning it was only our troop there, and for an hour or so, our shooting was limited only by the time it takes to fire several shots and get a new group up on the firing line. Great fun was had by all. While there, the adult leaders decided that we would shoot in competition for ice cream, and upon examining our targets, mine was the best one. By a significant margin. I mean, one of them would have had trouble hitting the bottom of a soda can with the muzzle stuck down the hole in the top.  Naturally, they challenged me to a double or nothing. There were four of them, and they said if I could do it again, and beat all four of them, they would EACH by me an ice cream bar, but if even one of them beat me, I would have to by each of them the ice cream. I arrogantly agreed, given my previous performance. 

We shot again. The range was declared clear, and we went down to examine our targets. I stood there for about 30 seconds, in shock. Then I turned around to a sea of laughing faces, and said, ""You guys are jerks!""

They had each sacrificed one or more shots from their own targets to take a potshot at mine. It was littered with stray holes from different shooters. I was pretty sure that I could tell which ones were mine, because mine were grouped tightly around the bulls-eye, but the ""impartial,"" third-party, range officer ""judge"" (he was in on it) for our informal competition declared that my target was invalid, and I was obligated to buy ice cream. 

It was all in good fun, and we all laughed about it. I actually felt good, given that the only way they could win the competition was to cheat, and they knew it. We all laughed about for the rest of the week. Besides, at the camp trading post, ice cream bars were only 50 cents, so for 2 bucks, it was worth it!",Top Shot? Not!,63

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

I've posted a few other stories [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/FredFltStn/submitted/) if you're interested.

**STORY:**  A guy came in to pick up some fireworks. He was having a party and wanted to put on an impressive show for his friends. I spent about 20 minutes walking him through the store, explaining the different items to him, and showing him videos of the stuff to help him pick out exactly what he wanted. He mentioned a couple of times how he usually goes to &lt;other store&gt; and how their prices were cheaper. Each time, I’d apologized, but I let him know that our prices were usually less than theirs, and that I thought that we had beat them on each of the items in question.

The third time it happened, I walked to our counter and grabbed the new catalog from &lt;other store&gt;. I found the stuff he had mentioned, and showed him how we were in fact cheaper on every item that he had selected (and that’s why I keep catalogs from my competitors on the counter). In fact, on a couple of items, we were about half of &lt;other store&gt; price. Amazingly, he didn’t seem happy about it, but he kept shopping.

By the time he was ready to check out, he had a rolling flat cart full of stuff. It was mostly large assortment packages, finale cakes, and big mortar kits, with a few smaller items here and there. To speed things up, and prevent us from having to unload all the big kits onto the counter, I started calling out the prices for the bigger items to the cashier (my dad). About halfway through, I got to one of the largest items, a massive mortar kit, and called out the price of $199.95. When my dad was ringing it in, the register display looked like it had screwed up, so I stopped him and went to check it out. Sure enough, the item had rung in at $19.95. 

While I’m talking to my dad about it, the customer walks over and demands to see the mistake. I show him that the last entry was for $19.95 instead of $199.95. He immediately tells me that I have to sell the item to him at the price that rang up. I showed him that the item itself had the correct price tag on it, and that the cashier had just miss-keyed it when he had rung it in. The guy gets agitated and repeatedly starts telling me that I have to legally sell the thing to him at that price since the cashier had rung it in like that. I calmly explained that if the item had been priced wrong, I would sell it to him at the incorrect price, but since it was just a miss-key, we would just void the last item rung in and do it again. Now armchair lawyer guy (ALG) starts yelling that he knows his rights and that I’m breaking the law if I have the cashier change the price and I don’t sell it to him at the wrong price.

Now I’ve had the staff screw up before when doing pricing, and if we put the wrong LOWER price tag on something, that’s what I’m going to sell it to you for. I also know that unless it’s an **ADVERTISED** price, I don’t **LEGALLY** have to do it, but if I screwed up, I’m going to eat that mistake and re-price the item after we’re done.  (Side note to Josh C. - Happy birthday today! And next time, pay attention to the damn price list when you’re using the price gun, because I know most of these screw-ups have your name on them. Also, go back to school and don’t do drugs).

ME:  Are you telling me that legally, even if we screwed up, I can’t have the cashier fix a mistake and that I have to sell you the item at whatever price was keyed into the register?!?

ALG:  Yes!

ME:  (looking at my dad) I guess we’re going to have to charge him whatever you keyed in.

I calmly walked back around the counter and picked up another item from his cart, a small fountain with a price tag of $9.95, and continued calling out the prices. When we were all done, my dad gave him the total.

ALG:  That can’t be right! That’s way too much! There’s no way I got that much stuff!

DAD:  Oops! Looks like the fountain rang in for $995.95. Did you want to pay that in cash or with a credit card?

ALG just glared at my dad for a few seconds then quietly asked if we could fix it.

butcherthrow,8,26,1nfy6o,18,"I used to work as a cashier at a butcher shop. The main part of my job was to handle customers while the butchers prepared the meat. 

One afternoon a customer came up and started browsing the counter window. I gave a standard acknowledgement asking, 'How's it going?' She didn't respond, but no big deal, customers sometimes don't hear or are intent on looking. After a minute another cashier did the same, and was similarly ignored. Then one of the butchers greeted her as well and he too was blanked. I can understand once, but after several people greet you, you're just being rude. 

My boss had seen all this happen and apparently wasn't in the mood to take shit that day, so he went through the store and instructed us to all ignore this woman if she asked for anything. 

No worries, if she wants to ignore us we can ignore her. 

So she eventually stops and does the universal stand and gaze of someone looking for service, and we all kept working. No eye contact, no acknowledgement. She stands there for a couple of minutes and then starts calling out, 'excuse me?' all that sort of thing. 

She's still getting nothing. 

She starts banging her hand on the counter and yelling for attention, my boss turns and as he walks up says ""Oh, you want to talk to me now, bitch?!"" 

To this day I don't know why she stayed because this was just the beginning. 

She was asking for a few kilos of mince, but my boss kept pretending to mishear her as he grabbed half a kilo, and weighed it, 1 kilo and weighed it, 5 kilos and weighed it, all while feigning sincerity (I don't know why he bothered given his opening). 

By this point we'd probably wasted about 10 minutes of her time, and personally, that was probably more than enough recompense. But as a kicker she ended up paying about $5 extra per kilo and had several holes ripped in her bag so as to ensure that it would fall out during transit. 

Finally she paid and received approximately $6 in change in 5 and 10 cent pieces, which my boss smashed on the counter so she would have to pick up any that fell over.

So over a long weekend. A friend and I went up on a long trip (&gt;1200 miles round trip) to go see Imagine Dragons in concert. We were lucky enough to be about 20 feet from the stage and in front of us was a small group of young teens, I'm guessing 12-14 years old. They had a friend with dwarfism who obviously had a hard time seeing at a standing-room-only concert, so they would take turns giving piggybacks to her so that she could see. They were in the perfect spot where there weren't all too many tall people in front. (I'm about 5' 6"" and didn't have any trouble seeing the stage.)
Enter Rude Drunk and GF (hereby known as RD&amp;GF). After getting drunk, they shoved the girls behind some tall guys and took their spot. My imposing 6'4"" father (who came to make sure that there weren't any shenanigans I was getting involved with at this distant concert) let them know that they had rudely taken this spot that these girls had. In RD's infinite wisdom, he replies, ""It's a concert."" We don't make a deal about it, but I'm fuming inside. Those girls were left behind some 6' + men and ended up going home early.
For the next 15 minutes, me and my friend hatched our plan. We would slowly press up against RD&amp;GF until they ended up behind the same 6'+ men that ruined the girls night.

lost_socrates,6,27,1nf2m8,64,"So the video store near my house has a handicapped space in front of it just like most others do.  When I went up there tonight some dildo in a rust bucket had parked not only IN the spot, but ACROSS it.

On to the revenge....   

I reached into my glovebox and found a piece of paper and a pen and left a nice little note that said something along the lines of ""you aren't handicapped but if you'd like to be it can be arranged""  

I snuck up to the car and slipped it under the windshield wiper and then went to my car to wait.   I was about 2 spots away from the car and so I knew I would get to see that ""oh shit"" face when the idiot came out.   

5 minutes later I was surprised to see not one, but TWO pieces of toothless hillbilly byproducts of cousin banging come strolling out the door.   The woman saw the note first and grabbed it and read it and when she did her eyes got big and her jaw dropped.   She gave the note to her boyfriend who read it and then started looking around the lot, screaming and yelling about ""who's ass he was gonna kick"". 

After about 30 seconds of stomping around, the two possum fed morons jumped back into their car and sped off.   

But I wasn't done there.   

I pulled out behind them and followed them from a distance just for shits and giggles.  About 2 miles down the road they stopped at Kroger.  I'm assuming it was for Spam, grits, and Busch Light.   Once they were well inside the store I wrote another note that said...

""Watching you stomp around like an ogre brought a smile to my face, I hope your dog dies on your birthday.  Have a good night"". 


I was going to stick around for a reaction, but I was already running behind, but just picturing this slack jawed yokel losing his mind has kept me smiling for the last 2 hours. 


Seriously kids... handicapped spots are for the people who really need them.

RadicalChic,180,566,1ne9m5,1659,"I work at an upscale restaurant that is half bar. Last night a group of pretty, well dressed women in their thirties strolled in about 12:30 and demanded a food menu. When I explained that our kitchen closes at midnight, one of them angrily pointed at another table and screeched, ""Well, THEY have food"". When I tell them that that particular table ordered their food twenty minutes prior, and that is why they in fact have food on their table, she waved me away telling me to ask the kitchen what they can do.

The kitchen relents and the ladies get a hummus. I set it down and they descend upon it, nary a thank you. They don't order anything else and I keep enough of an eye on them to make sure they are taken care of without me actually having to interact with them more than I have to. The last time I check up on them asking if they need anything I get a curt no. Five minutes later, they're gone. 

My annoyance turns to glee when I go to clear the table. One of them has left behind her iPhone. I drop it into my apron and walk up to a guy that I saw chatting them up earlier and ask if he knew them. He tells me no, that they were horrendously bitchy and that he got the fuck out of that situation as soon as possible. I tell him my experience with them, and he asks how much their bill was (it was $10). He then shoves $20 into my hand, telling me he'll cover it and I can keep the rest. I try to refuse it since it wasn't his fault that they walked out, but he insists.

I go to the office and explain the situation to my manager, who is as pissed off as I am. When one of the woman's friends calls the phone, my manger answers it up and tells her that she is welcome to come by to pick up the phone and pay her tab, otherwise she will have to wait until Monday at 5 PM to get it (we're closed on Sunday. If it had been any other customer we would have worked something out to get her phone to her earlier, but fuck her).

Well, apparently this woman has a friend who knows one of our bartenders. This friend calls our bartender, who I'm fairly close with and knew about the situation, asking if he could bring the phone to her on Sunday. He tells her no, that the woman skipped out on her bill and will need to personally come in to get her phone. The woman never came in that night.

Slackjawedyokelsex,37,69,1ndqid,147,"A couple days ago I decided to go on a ruck march around town. It was nice out, weather was mellow, and I had done this particular route a few times. So, I get going around noon at a pretty good clip and continue that way for most of the route. Then, around 8 miles in I felt an  uncontrollable urge to vomit. Not wanting to be doubled over and heaving on the side of a busy road, I rush into an auto-parts store a short distance away.
 I made it inside and encountered a short, fat man standing at the counter. ""Sir,"" I said "" you wouldn't happen to have a restroom I could use would you?"", barely holding back the torrent of vomit rising up from my stomach.

 ""Only for customers and employees."" was his reply.

""Sir, I'm about to be sick. It's kind of an emergency."" I moaned.

""Then go around the side of the building."" he said as he continued to read his magazine.

I couldn't hold it any longer so I flipped him a quick middle finger and rushed out of the store, barely making it to the parking lot before I began to empty my stomach. As soon as I recovered, I began to make my way behind the store so I could continue wretch in at least semi-privacy. That's when I felt it. A rumble... in my bowels... oh shit. I raced around the edge of the store as the pressure on my B-hole climbed from 0 to 3500psi in a matter of seconds. 
     I made it with no time to spare. I slung off my heavy ruck and pulled my shorts down to my boots and let loose the most foul slurry of partially digested ramen that the world has ever known. Unbeknownst to me, my ""angle of attack"" was a little too close to the building. The pressurized jet of liquid feces had covered the white brick. It was now a sickly yellow color. Of course, I vomited immediately. Same angle, only higher in elevation.                
The vomit and feces had begun to coalesce into something altogether unwholesome when I decided to take my leave and finish the last few miles. 
     I caught the old man's eye as I exited the parking lot. Little did he know that I, the Banksy of barf, had left a malodorous masterpiece for him to discover (and clean) before he closed the doors for the night. Should have just let me use your bathroom, bro.

Problem is, during peak hours I can't use the Internet and everything loads slowly, we complained about it and tried getting it fixed. Being a Tech geek I knew someone was using torrents or using video streaming.

I asked my friend to upgrade the connection which he did and I did a speedtest and it seemed the connection was being leeched and we would only get a small percentage of bandwidth.

We had two routers and I configured them in such a fashion that anyone with the key would get in to the second router which was capped by the first router.

The first router had it's SSID hidden and access restricted to me and my friend computers and devices. Now, we can do whatever we wanted and the neighbors were stuck with 512Kbps of speed.

Even the landlord was stuck and he couldn't figured out what happened. I should my friend how to enable and disable the setting to avoid anyone suspecting but I doubt anyone will find our about the hidden SSID since not everyone is into networks, even the local ISP techs wouldn't be able to figure it out.

Synchrotr0n,46,61,1ncwvl,249,"This is not a typical petty revenge, but I think it's worth sharing.

I have a shitty 1 Mbps connection in the apartment where I live with a flatmate and every time there is more than one person using it I just can't do anything other than browsing websites, *slowly*. As a gamer, that annoys me deeply because I get huge pings and it completely prevents me from playing most games.

Sometimes my flatmate even reaches the point of downloading torrents, which consumes 100% of the bandwidth for countless hours, and when I ask him about it he simple denies, but one day I noticed on his computer that he was indeed using torrents and I was really angry about it, although I didn't say anything.

In order to improve (but not really solve) my situation since I'm not getting 50% of the internet service I'm paying for, I kept asking him if he wanted to upgrade the speed but he always keeps stalling and in the end nothing ever happens.

An interesting turn of events happened when I discovered that the router we use has an option to limit the bandwidth of each user. I then set his IP to 50% of the speed, and did the exact same on my computer since I'm not trying to rip off anyone, so now every person is getting exactly 50% of the speed. It's not ideal since the router's option is limited and doesn't let a person use 100% of the connection when only one user is active, but at least now I can play games without a ping of 3000+ ms.

I didn't tell him that I changed the router's configuration and naturally he noticed a decrease on his internet speed, but he doesn't have a clue about what is causing it. Now that it's affecting him, and not just me, he is obviously annoyed by that and luckily he will finally stop giving excuses not to increase the speed.

I wish I didn't have to do this, but a 1 Mbps connection is extremely slow on the current days, even in a developing nation like mine. Back in my hometown I have a 10 Mbps connection, and it's also slow compared to the best connections, but at least it allows everyone on the house to browse website, watch youtube videos and play games without affecting the enjoyment of others.","Flatmate didn't want to upgrade our internet so I ""cheated"" to convince him of that.",310

I was cruising down the center lane at 65, with a car slightly ahead of me on my left, going about 64. on my right, a fair distance ahead, was a car going 60 or so, no sweat. While it is true 64 shouldn't necessarily have been in the left lane at that speed, but that was their call.

In my rear-view I can see a particularly speedy car slip from the far right into my lane, slide over to the right and begin to right 64's ass, 64 doesn't budge.  after a few seconds Asshole slips back into my lane, righting tight on my ass, I'm not about to budge, and in fact slow down a bit, nothing too aggressive, just trying to send a cautionary message. and when that doesn't work I tap my brakes a few times.

by now 60 has dropped back, and there is just enough room for Asshole to slip right, resulting in a honk. I'm getting annoyed. then, I hear his car start to speed right the hell up. I see that there is a truck a little further along on the right, and Asshole is going to have to slip RIGHT in front of me to get ahead and on his way. Well that pisses me right the hell off; so I speed up.

I don't look at him or anything, I just jam the gas, and we get up to 75 before he breaks off, starts honking at me and yanks himself left two lanes, I take this time to slow down, he pulls up next to me, honking and making a general ass of himself. I take 2 seconds to look left and enthusiastically smile and wave. he, of course, is flipping me off and swearing, which couldn't have made me feel better.

[deleted],9,31,1nc016,79,"So this happened a few years ago now, and still gets talked about. My mate had recently moved back into the area for work and I offered to let him crash at mine while he was looking for his own place. I was in a bedsit/house share, shared kitchen and bathroom, but my room was big enough to accommodate both a double bed and a sofa. The sofa was at the foot end of the bed.

I used to work split shifts, 9.00-5.30 one week 11.30-8.00 the next, so on the weeks I was on lates I'd take the sofa for the night and let my mate kip in the bed, then get in for a couple of hours after he got up. I'd like to mention at this point that I'm a girl, he's a guy. To paraphrase Marlon Brando, he's like a brother to me... In that the idea of sharing a bed makes us both feel ill.

I'm more proud than I ever thought it possible to be of the beast I unleashed the morning after that pizza. I'd been on the sofa that night and he'd have to come past there to get his work stuff. The beauty of this fart was it was silent, I mean barely even a whisper, this was too good an opportunity to waste. He had no idea when he sleepily sauntered across the room into a wall of fart. Yes, that's me, GrumpyHippy: The Phil Spector of Farts. It was glorious to see his face change from sleep addled to abject horror within moments. I swear he retched at least once.

She wasn't poor or anything, and always had her own food. But if she saw someone with a bag of chips or something she'd ask for some.

I regularly run errands for my grandfather. This includes doing his grocery shopping. His grocery lists are usually somewhat embarrassing for me (15 king sized candy bars, mens products, denture glue, etc.) especially since I am a female.
Well today I was doing another one of his grocery runs when these two teenage girls walked by me. They see the items in my cart (mostly razors, shaving cream, etc. for men) and start laughing at me. Now I know it looks strange for me to be buying this stuff, but these girls would not stop laughing. They start making jokes about me and how I must be a man, all while I am standing directly in front of them. I kinda shrugged it off, flashed them a dirty look, and continued my shopping.

Apparently, their items cost more than they wanted to spend and they walked out, leaving a huge cart of groceries for the employees to put away.

Fast forward a few minutes later. I have put my groceries away and am about to pull out when I see the girls coming down the row in their own car. Knowing I was their only obstacle to getting out of the parking lot, I slowly reversed and then drove about 2 mph the rest of the way down the road.

out-of-phase,19,61,1nbpyg,252,"Alright, so let's just say I don't drive the nicest car. In fact, I'll be the first to admit that it's ugly as hell. I drive a 1989 Honda CRX HF. For what it is, it's great. I bought it for 500 bucks a few months ago when I was in a pinch, and she's held up very well. I also get up to 50 MPG on the highway!

But, when I bought it, it was spray painted puke green. It also has those ugly ""euro"" tail lights, and a fart-can exhaust. I didn't make these modifications, but I've lived with them. Now, every once in a while, someone will try to race me. Probably because they see these modifications and think that I want to race or something, I don't know. Normally I just ignore them and go on about my business and everything's fine.

But the other day, I was driving down State Route 50 on my way to work. On this particular section of Route 50, there are long stretches of 45 MPH zones, with a few traffic lights in between.

Anyway, I was minding my own business, driving the speed limit (frankly, it's hard to speed when you're driving a little gas sipping 72 horsepower car), and I slow down for a stop light. I hear all this ruckus behind me, and when I look in my rearview mirror I see some sort of exotic sports car approaching. As it gets closer, I realize it's a Ferrari, and a good looking one at that. I was pretty sure it was a 458 Italia, but I'm still not sure.

They pull up next to me at the light, it's an older gentleman driving, probably in his 50s. My inner school-boy comes alive, and I roll down the window, and say, ""Hey man, that's an awesome car! Is that the 458?""

His reply wasn't as friendly. ""Ha, you think you can take me in that little piece of shit?""

""What? No, I was just sayi--""

""Don't even try kid. I shouldn't even waste my time. This is a $400,000 car.""

I shrugged. Thats when I realized I had a rare opportunity to have some fun. On this spot of route 50, after the light, there's a little extended shoulder further up the road where cops LOVE to hide. Cops hide there so often, in fact, that locals usually slow down just to be careful, before they've even reached the spot.

So, knowing this, I turned back at him and smiled arrogantly, and started revving my little 1.5 liter fart cannon. He started revving his car. The light turned green, and I made sure to launch as hard as I could so that my tires would squeak. As soon as the light turned green, he took off like a madman.

As soon as I reached 45 I stopped accelerating and just started going the speed limit, by then he was way off in the distance. I was hoping and hoping and hoping that there'd be a cop waiting up at the usual hiding spot.

Yeah, he probably just got a speeding ticket.

Yesterday, I had a table of 3 business women, one of which obviously thought that I was their servant. She snapped her fingers at me to get my attention, refused to look at me when I took her order and was just rude the entire time. 

So I bring out their food, and the other 2 women (politely) ask for extras (cocktail sauce, Tobascco, ketchup) but the 3rd woman demands that I bring her extra tartar sauce. No 'Can I have?', no 'please'. Just 'You need to bring me some extra tartar sauce.' So I go back to the kitchen, grab the cocktail sauce (which is right next to the tartar sauce), Tobascco and ketchup and take it back to the table. The woman looks at everything I brought, then at me with disgust, and says 'Hey you forgot my tartar sauce!' I tell her 'Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go get it.' And then turn and talk to one of my other tables for a minute. 

I ended up going to the kitchen, several times, for some other things but every time, I ""accidentally"" forgot to get her tartar sauce. She never did get any and ended up having to eat her fried food with out any. They all asked for separate checks and (no surprise) she didn't tip me. But the other 2 tipped me well enough that it didn't really matter.

This often causes distractions from everybody and it is hard to stay focused with douchenozzels grunting about their games.

I was in my Geometry class and some little shit in front of me is playing Madden 25 for iPad. The teacher didn't notice and gave us problems to do, so he got away with it.

I'm allergic to bee stings, we were at least 45 minutes from the nearest medical facility, and most of our co-workers were non-English speaking production workers.

This was on a hot August afternoon, when the are the most aggressive toward potential intruders/food.

I got some Yellow Jacket attractant that's made for bait traps, and put the liquid on the headband of his hard hat. (It is a food manufacturing plant, and everybody - even the CEO and executives - are required to wear them in most areas of the facility).

He couldn't figure out why the Yellow Jackets kept flying in his face. They wold get aggressive and start biting and stinging when he started swatting them away. He finally quit a few weeks later. He tried to file for unemployment, but the company fought him and used his own documents against him: He put in writing that the Yellow Jackets weren't a problem, and that I was using my allergy as an excuse to avoid working.

I actually heard him say, ""But...but...I didn't mean it like that!""

The HR manager noticed I was keeping close tabs on what happened to the guy, and asked me if I knew anything about it. I said I didn't - that the wasps must have known he was an asshole, and the smell of shit attracted them.

As I began crossing the street, I decided to stay on the side of the crosswalk the guy's car was in, rather than going around it.

To start off, I am a yard duty at an elementary school. I'm the youngest one who works there (late teens) and the kids seem to think I am their best friend and alot of the time forget i am a person in charge. I play with them sometimes because it honestly is a fun time, but one day one kid just rubbed me the wrong way.

This particular day was good! There was not any injuries or drama or gossip between the kids that they came crying to me about. When the lunch recess came around, the 4th and 5th graders who liked kickball(played like american baseball but you kick a bouncy ball as opposed to hitting it a with a bat)came running out to the kickball field.

Since it was a good day, I decided to go be all-time pitcher (that way it's fair for both teams.) And into the third inning one kid-let's call him nick- was just having a rough time with getting out almost immediately everytime he went up to kick. Nick started to blame my pitching and evertime he would get a foul would always yell how I suck and how I am at fault for throwing him a bad pitch.


The incident: Nick kicked the ball straight to one of the outfielders and ran off crying. Since he has had anger problems before, I let him go release his anger towards me in his own way. About 5 minutes later, over the walkie talkie I hear my boss/girlfriends mother go ""hey pengylover200, are you bullying the kids on the kickball field?"" ""No, why?"" ""Nick told me how you are being unfair. Can you either stop playing with the kids or just be fair please?"" "".....sure""


The revenge: this just got real. Nick came back to the line waiting to kick and I was giving people VERY easy at bats just so i could get a chance to throw against this kid. Bases loaded, he needs one run to win the game before recess is over and he's thinking he is gunna get an easy pitch. I threw that little shit of a kid the greatest three fastballs ever. His friends groaned when he got out and he ran away crying in embrarassment. Needless to say, he'll think twice next time about being respectful to his elders.

uofmfoott,4,18,1na4g2,28,"After I posted the original story involving Randy the bully, I eventually mentioned the guy in question to the friends involved, and got some interesting information...

Shortening the story a bit, when I was in elementary school, Randy was one of a group of kids who would pick on me. He showed up again in high school, looking like this: http://imageshack.us/a/img15/3117/hjap.jpg and still being a complete asshole, mocking a lot of different people. He was part of a group of kids who were mostly Chaldean, known for being complete jerks. Randy sexually harassed a female friend of mine, made fun of another's weight (Randy was definitely fatter), and- UNFORGIVABLY, in my opinion- told a very depressed friend of mine that it would be better if he just killed himself.

My rage knows no bounds.

Randy never spoke to me, and I doubt he even recognized me. But one day, I managed to get a lovely picture of him sitting with his friends.

http://imageshack.us/a/img6/7832/sbutt7.jpg

Yes, it's lovely. So I gave this picture to my friends who had a problem with him. I never thought that they actually did anything about it.

I was wrong.

The one friend who was told to kill himself went OFF on Randy. He e-mailed him the picture, told him he'd send it to all of his friends and any girl he ever considered dating, said he'd post it all over the internet, and said it would be easy to get more since his fat ass was hanging out all over the place. (His words, apparently.) Randy never responded to that, but the next time Randy even tried to TALK to him, my friend just started speaking really viciously to him, and calling him all sorts of things I don't want to repeat. Basically, he bullied the bully for a week before Randy backed off and never spoke to him again.

My other male friend who had been picked on, about his weight, actually had a small fight with Randy. It wasn't major, or everyone would have heard about it, but Randy was ""play-wrestling"" with him when the teacher was out of the classroom (like, putting an arm around his head and trying to headlock him) and my friend actually responded, struggled with him, and gave him a wedgie. A wedgie. There are few injuries more humiliating. Guess he really should have pulled up his pants. Randy was too humiliated to tell the teacher, and my friend actually transferred soon after so there was no retaliation.

My female friend told me that, a few months ago, she had gone into the Happy's Pizza where he works, and seen him unexpectedly. He tried to buddy-buddy up to her in front of his co-workers, who all apparently hate him. She responded talking cheerfully about how she had heard about him trying p90x (he stopped after two days), asked him where he was going to college (he's not), and other such things. She also congratulated him on ""losing some weight since high school"" (he's actually larger) and got her pizza. All in one friendly conversation.

So, three separate revenges, only one using the picture I took. Still, I feel like the Count of Monte Cristo. Never expected Randy to really get what was coming to him.

Silver_Ginyu,19,76,1n9y8l,304,"First of all, let me say I love this subreddit and have been reading it for a while now.
Second, I wasn't the mastermind behind this, it was my friend, but still it was awesome just to be a part of it.

So here's the story (also, since I'm not from the US I'll simply convert my currency to $$ for easier understanding)

I was hanging out with my friend (let's call him Dom) when he told me he has to go fill up the tank in his car. It was a sunday and he'll be needing a full tank for his work tomorrow. He decides to fill gas for 100$.
Now, in my country, if you pay with cash it's common that if you go 10 cents under or over a round sum the cashier simply ignores it, so mostly we go 5 or 10 cents above. Like I said, my friend filled the tank for 100$, but it ended up being 100,10$. No biggie, he has a 100$ bill prepared and enters the gas station store to pay.

Here's where it gets interesting: the cashier turns out to be an asshole. As my friend gives him the 100$ bill he says ''Sorry bro, but you're 10 cents short. I need those 10 cents.''

Dom was like WTF, and said ''I don't have any small money, just this and a 200$ bill.''
- Well gimme that 200 then...

At this point Dom is furious. I couldn't hear what was going on since I stayed in the car, but Dom's hand gestures were indicating some asshole behavior.
The cashier gives Dom the change (199$ and 90 cents in small bills and coins) and even from the car I could see a smirk on his face. 

That's when the fun begun. Dom takes the money and starts to leave, but just as he was at the door he turns around and goes back to the cashier.
- Sorry man, I almost forgot, gimme a pack of chewing gums.
- No problem, here. That'll be 4,99.

Dom gives him a 10$ bill, the cashier returns 5 and was like ''Thank you, come again''.
But Dom isn't moving. The cashier asks if something's wrong, and the answer was just:
- You didn't give me all of my money back..
- What do you mean?
- Well the pack of gums is 4,99, I gave you a 10 and you returned me 5 dollars.
- I don't see the problem her-
- I want my 1 cent...

(A side note: a 1 cent coin here is something nobody has. It has zero purpose or value so not even big shops have some in the register. Back to the conversation...)

The shock on the cashier's face was obvious.
- Sir, I-
- I want my one cent.
- I don't have that here in the store..
- I don't care, it's my money and you legally have to give it back to me.

So for the next 15 minutes that dude is searching his pockets, under the register, back in the storage, everywhere to find a very useless coin. Finally he says ''Excuse me'', leaves the station and goes to the bookies across the street. In the meantime I got a bit annoyed and entered the store to see what's wrong. Dom fills me in on the story, and finally the dude returns with a one cent coin, literally slams it on the counter and squeezes out a very forcefull ''Here you go sir...''

Dom says ''Thanks'', picks up the coin, opens the door, throws the penny in the trash can, turns around and says ''Thank you very much'' and we get in the car and leave. The cashier was petrified after he saw what Dom did and I'm sure a lot of cursing happened after we went.

I can only imagine how Dom felt because for me, who spent most of the time in the car, that was one of the most badass pettiest moments I can remember.

So I come home from a long day of work and some asshole had parked in my spot.  Since each person's spot is assigned, there's nowhere else for me to park.  I drive halfway down the block and park my car, pissed, and walk back.

When I get inside, I immediately start thinking of ways to fuck with the car. I wanted petty revenge, not property damage that could lead to jailtime.  I put large, jagged rocks underneath each of their tires, so they'll either unwittingly drive over them, or they'll have to spend time moving all of them out of the way before they drive.  I salvage every ounce of willpower to not smash their windows in as I put the rocks underneath the tires.  I go back inside.

They hadn't moved their car by 1AM, so I decide they need a little more coercion. I get a big wad of vaseline on my hand and wipe it underneath every single handle on the car's doors.

To get onto my street, you need to do a right turn. So anyways, I was driving home from work and got off the highway. I'm on the main road now and there are a loooot of cars in front of me. Everyone was only going about 50km/hr and most people were maintaining proper distances between cars, including myself. I'm driving patiently down the road when I notice this guy in a fiat500 tailing me super closely - I could barely see his lights. There was seriously no point since I couldn't go any faster but he just kept tailing me and tailing me. I move over a bit towards the curb so he can see that there's no room in front of me to go any faster but he doesn't care - he just keeps tailing me. As I approached my intersection, I kept an eye on the crosswalk sign. It's counting down. I decided to slow down a bit and the cars in front of me began to pull away. The guy behind me got impatient and, in addition to tailing me, starts weaving his car back and forth. I'm around 50m to the intersection now and watch the countdown go from 4, 3, 2, 1..  I start signalling right and slow down even more. I'm 10m from the intersection when the light turns yellow. I could have gone faster. I could have turned quickly. If I had done either of those things, the guy behind me could have zipped through on the yellow... but guess what, asshole? You're not making this. At the light, I completely stopped.

It wasn't particularly busy and I managed to park two spaces away so it's not like he caused me any great hardship and infact I walked into the store directly behind him. 

I had pretty much forgotten about the incident but as I was finishing bagging my things at the self-service counters, I notice the same guy is about to finish scanning his. This sparks an idea in my head and as I walk by him, I gently kneel onto the end of his bagging area and then quickly get off.

sconnie64,171,204,1n9569,862,"Yesterday I was working out in my school's weight room, it has been a habit for me for around 6 years so I'm no stranger to gym culture. I was doing some power cleans on one of the many platforms and was having a pretty good lift. Until the track girls showed up, wearing make-up carrying cellphones and wearing highlighter colored EVERYTHING to workout (you know the type). 

There is a policy at our schools workout facility where any in season athlete can kick a non-athlete off of the equipment, I don't like this rule, but i knew what i was getting into when i bought my membership. Back to the story. I was on my last set and a group of 3 track girls show up to my platform and tell me to ""Get off our platform"" I say i have one more set and i would be happy to after that. As i am preparing for my final set they inform me that they can kick me off of any equipment they need I tell them that only applies to in-season athletes, Track is a winter and spring sport (Including indoor season) not a fall sport. I get the response ""It's our weightroom, we are doing you a favor by letting you stay in here."" 

At this point i have had enough of their shit so I finish my last set with them glaring at me and promptly drop about 230 pounds of barbell at my feet, turn around and say ""all yours"" and walk away (keep in mind this is an olympic-style bumper plate weight set designed to be dropped repeatedly).

atomsk404,5,11,1n90ef,0,"**ok, first, sorry its so long, but you need the backstory:**


so almost a decade ago i ran with a totally different crew of people, had a bunch of fun raving it up, doing the drug scene yada yada. one of our favorite events was DEMF (detroit electronic music festival). i had a buddy named ""michael t. hogan"" who was a cool guy, ladies man, and pretty funny. downside of MTH was he was younger than all of us, worked sporadically and lived with his folks. This meant he would rarely have money to chip into for things like hotel rooms. We liked him a lot so it wasn't a problem to just allow him a room card and let him stay with us, cause fuck it, its demf and we are all hanging out anyways. 

so one year we do it big. we all had good paying jobs, and detroit is cheap, and we have a killer hookup on the hallucinogens. take the bus there, get a 1 bedroom suite at the GM building overlooking the fest, worked out perfect for the 5 of us. MTH has a chicky from WI he's been trying to seal the deal with and she came separately with her group of friends so we knew and approved HER coming up with him...cause we kinda knew her through other friends, and who am i to tell him he can't get his dick wet?

so this year, we brought up a fear and loathing kit...serious damage was to be done on our brain cells. MTH, wanting to be suave and look good decided he was going to forgo the harder stuff and just drink. mind you a drink cost like 5 bucks each, and he didn't chip in on the hotel...but whatever we all had money and its NBD, go get drunk...more for us right?

day 1, no hitch, we all have fun and decide first thing in the AM we are breaking out the dropper and papers and gonna go nuts starting at 10am...fest opens at 12. MTH goes to meet up with chicky and have a few beers prior to the gates opening. we spend the first 3 hours on just a couple tabs each, and decide around 2 pm to go back up and redose to get us through the afternoon music and then come back for a nice 'dinner' later O_o

we get to our room, and 6 girls are in our hotel, none of which we know and MTH is no where to be seen. being that we were a pretty tight group, and we had many felonies in our hotel &amp; not only was it not hidden beyond the desk drawer we were super pissed. one girl was peeing in the bathroom WITH THE DOOR OPEN as we walked in...serious WTF...

MTH gets a phone call, and is up in the room in like 2 minutes. stated he just went down to the pop machine to get a few cokes, cause they are about to drink a bottle of rum. whatever dude, you left randos unattended in the den...never do such a thing! we let it all slide, cause again, we are in our world and don't want things to get too crazy and screw it all up for the rest of the day. after he and the randos leave, we hatch a ***devious plot***

MTH has been bumming smokes from all of us, and we each had bought a carton, so he knows the gravy train will continue despite the rando incident. we decide, since the one girl is against doing the LSD, we would salt his game, dip the filter and put it in the pack upside down for easy fuckery. we are all supposed to meet up later in the day for a headlining event, and do so successfully. MTH is SHIT FACED. i mean like falling over, barely can hold his drink, eyes half closed DRUNK. he asks for a smoke...the plan is a go! we hand him the smoke with the extra surprise, he smokes it with relish. as smoking, an errant beach ball comes out of nowhere and hits him in the hand as he's taking a drag. the cig breaks with two drags to go, oh well damage is done! he throws it down and the girl with him **PICKS THE FUCKER UP**and says 'its still good...and takes a drag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

well now our little plot just took an unexpected turn. so we had to sit them both down right then and there and cop to what we did. They both spend 5 minutes being pissed off at us. we remind them they were assholes for opening our room up to the general public, especially considering MTH was on a free ride. luckily the girl was cool with it, and they both enjoyed the ride with us the rest of the night...but there was a 10 second vision i had of going to jail in detroit and literally saw my future flashing away before my eyes.

Basically, I stand at the entrance to the road, and prevent cars from running over soldiers conducting Physical Fitness Training. This is somewhat problematic, because there are a few industrial buildings along this road where civilians have to check in to work during Physical Training time. Normally, we just redirect the traffic to a safer route. 

Today, there was a guy who just couldnt listen. Ol boy pulled up at my intersection, and I asked him where he was going.  

'Fuel Farm' he says.

'Sorry sir, youll have to flip a U turn and get there by duncan street, actually if you cut through that parking lot back there-'

'But I take this road *every day*!'

'Sorry sir, this is Friday, not every day, and the road is closed to all vehicles. youll have to turn around'

'Hell no', he says 'Im going this way'

I got a little angry

'Go that way, sir, and Ill call the effing MPs' (Military Police)

'Call the MPs, then, I dont care!' 
At this, he stomped on his accelerator, drove onto the closed road, and sped off, narrowly avoiding several soldiers. 

Now, I like to be known as a man of my word. Since he told me where he worked, I drove up there after Physical Training hours, and snapped a pic of his plates. I called the MPs, and theyre on their way to take my statement. With any luck at all, hell be heavily ticketed, and possibly banned from ever driving on Fort Bliss again.

For the next six months we carried this on. We'd wait until Chris was a little bit tipsy and then start substituting his drinks with little glasses of coke. It was surprising how well it worked (and how much money I saved!).

When Chris found out he stared blankly for a good five seconds as the last 6 months of his life replayed in his head. It was magnificent watching him come to grips with how perfectly and completely we had made him pay for his indiscretion.

I know he reads reddit. I hope you reads this, Chris!",Operation Dry Hump,955
Itsthesweetieman,9,26,1n5tmm,80,"I work at a sandwich shop in a local shopping center. The kind of shop where people get choose their sandwich fillings and the poor drone behind the counter (i.e. Me) fetches and creates said sandwich. I've had the unfortunate pleasure of dealing with this one rude older woman who speaks English with very strong foreign accent, however she is quite fluent. The old slag and her friend would constantly harangue myself and my fellow drones for not putting enough in their sandwiches, overcharging (when they had a billion things jammed in there), not being able to understand them etc. On top of that there was one time where I gave her her sandwich and she simply walked away without paying. After not seeing her for a while, she came back with her troglodyte friend and ordered a sandwich which my manager made. I jumped in, petty revenge burning in the forefront of my mind, and rang it up on the register. I can't remember how much it was exactly, but her change ended up being about $4 (AUD). I lied and told her we had only small change left and gave her her $4 in 5s, 10s, and 20s (only like... 3 twenties, mind). Australian coins look like [this](http://webmaths.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/aucoins-m.jpg). Her face was worth it. Enjoy your shrapnel, bitch. Oh, and my manager thought it was hilarious.

TL;DR: Asshat old lady is a bitch to me at work, so I gave her enough coins to drown a hobo as change.","Your change, Ma'am.",106
thedudeman97,3,24,1n5mik,53,This is my first post so here we go. So one time I had a friend over to my place and we were drinking. We never really drank together before but he told me he drank rum strait. We were just hanging out I had just finish my second glass when he finished his first so I told him I'd refill his when I got my next drink and as soon as I hand it to him he spilled it all over my carpet. I was kind of pissed but shit happens so I let it go. Later that night he was pretty plastered and he wasn't saying much until he said he felt weird and was going to throw up but just sat there. He didn't get up until he started throwing up so I just dragged him outside so he wouldn't throw up everywhere. I went back in my house and cleaned up the mess and went back to check on him to make sure he didn't wander off out pass out in his puke.  When I got out there I found him sitting in his car. I asked him what he was doing and he said he was going to sleep in his car (a station wagon) and won't give me his keys. Later after a near fistfight I convince him to give me his keys if I get him some food. So I got inside and the only thing I had already made was some tuna so I made sandwiches when I got back out there he didn't want his sandwich and was going back inside to sleep. So my revenge was to throw the sandwich in the back of his car where he never cleaned and it was the summer so by the time we got up his car was baking. His car smelt bad for like two weeks and he still doesn’t know I did it. 1 me 0 bad guest,bad guest,77

So been delivering beer to this liquor store for a few months now. The old owner was very nice and never questioned any order I delivered,  just drop it off and I was on my way. He even had some of his employes help with unloading sometimes. Recently the Old Guy retired and sold his business to this Cheap Bastard (OG and CB from here). CB didn't have helpers. He is the only guy there now ( I wonder why all employes quit and his customers left after he raised all the prices) Anyways I don't mind unloading the stuff on my own as most deliveries don't have help. But this guy really slowed me He makes me sort his empty bottle returns and always thinks I'm somehow not refunding the full amount. (Hire someone to do it for you! You CB) I digress

OG was nice to his costumers, OG would sell the 24packs at $22.95 and the six packs at $9.95 (OG would simply sell the unopened 4x24 to customers). As you can see the six packs would make more money.  We had this account for years now and we would deliver 24packs of Heineken sealed with four 6packs inside at the same price as the loose case. Our cost is $2.40 more, but we would do it as he sold plenty of them and it was a courtesy thing with this longtime account so that's all he ordered, no need for loose packs.would buy them at $18.80 (our little discounted rate) and we simply  use the 1x24 code, no problem. 

Well Last week I delivered CB and CB was saying how he wants to check over everything and make sure we are not shorting him. He thinks we are messing with him. It might have been that recently Heineken changed the bottle so the bar code number (UPC) was different and he thought we are messing with him or that he just noticed that the UPC he was getting was different than the invoice. Before I go on my way he asks me to go through each delivered box of brews (sure no problem, some owners just like two double check). When we get to the Heineken he starts going off on how I changed the UPC and that Its not what he used to order. (I did that to save you money dumbass, but I kept that thought to myself). I knew in the back of my head he enjoyed being able to get four 6packs at that price and break them up to make more money. I told him that Heineken changed the bottles some of the numbers but everything was the same. 

After about 3 minutes of him debating that we are somehow changing the UPCs on him I say "" Oh yes you're right let me get the one that is listed on the invoice"" (little to his knowledge its the 1x24 loose) I gave him the loose cases. He takes them without opening one in front of me thinking he somehow struck magic treasure chest. I knew that whole week he wasn't able to sell 6packs. To my enjoyment today when I came to unload the delivery, he started helping me unload off the truck asking me if he could use that old UPC (the deal). I told him sorry, Heineken discontinued that. He then had to ring up some customers

Waiting around, I was standing next to one of his coolers a customer came by and thought I was an employee and asked me if there were any 6packs. I told him no and also to check the store up the street as the sell it for $9.50 (on sale since been hooking up the other stores with the deal I used give to OG) and CB recently jacked his to $12.95 and most likely he wouldn't be getting any that week. 

Tl;dr: Deliver beer at discounted rate, question my job, raise your prices and waste my time. I sell your discounted beer to your competition and tell your customers to go elsewhere.


Again, Sorry for any spelling or formatting. Posting from phone.

Edit Edit: I just made another round of edits.

DeeFB,4,24,1n5cuc,40,"So at the restaurant I work at, we have this busser. He's a nice guy, but sometimes he can be a little shit(In a good way, I really don't hate any of my coworkers). So last week, he puts hazelnut coffee syrup in my water I had in the back. Tasted awful and he's sitting there laughing it up. I tried getting him back, but nothing really happened and we stopped for a bit.

Today, he was just being obnoxious and calling me a weird nickname, so I remembered last week, and put a dab of steak sauce in his water. Boom.",You can't just put shit in my water like that.,64
