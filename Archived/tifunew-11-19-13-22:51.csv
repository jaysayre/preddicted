Toxictrace,1,1,1r14y4,1,"I was just enjoying my post-dinner poop sesh in the upstairs bathroom in my parent's house, where I recently moved back into. Now, they use sandpaper-roughness level TP, always have. I, being a young man full of hopes and dreams of silken rolls for my cheeks, have been buying very nice, soft tissues for myself while I was out of the house. 

I am also a very vigorous wiper, as I don't want to leave any traces. Anyway, I was finishing up when I felt some pain back there. Upon 'inspection', I saw some red. I checked again, and yep, more red. So now I'm sitting here trying not to move, since I ripped open my butthole with sandpaper TP.

This actually occurred a little under two years ago but anyway.

Every year during the long summer holidays my family have a tradition of heading up to go camping on the East coast of the North Island (NZ). The spot where we go is seriously a fairy tale place: a huge bay with golden sweeping sands, constant sunshine, warm water, big waves, few people, reefs to explore, you get the idea. This year I happened to know that there was a girl there I'd met the previous year who was quite into me. As you can imagine, I'm well keen. The morning after we arrive, virtually as soon as I get up, she bounds over and says she's taking me for my first swim, right now. I'm all about it so we head out into the blue to get wet (me hoping other things may get wet later on). I dive into the water and that's where things begin to take a turn for the unexpected.

As soon as I come up I realise the left side of my face is numb and I can't speak. 

Yep, you guessed it. Brain hemorrhage. 

Ended up spending two weeks in hospital, three months off school and two years later I still can't attend school 5 days a week because I get too tired. I haven't had any luck with the ladies since then either, may or may not be related. 

TL;DR went for a swim with a girl, got brain damaged. ",TIFU by going for a swim with a girl I like.,11

ApacheChi3f,3,0,1r0s98,3,"Just before I delve into this; I wasn't drunk or intoxicated on anything of any kind, I'm not all the desperate, and I wasn't flustered in a rage of emotions. 

So there's this exgirlfriend of mine whom I still talk to from time to time and we still get along great more or less when not distracted by the lingering tension. Now, I'm kind of a cynical asshole and feel nothing but apathy towards everything. I've been in and out of relationships every now and then and it just never worked out but I always find myself thinking about her and how I don't feel like much of a cynical asshole (yeah I know how stupid and pathetic that might sound.) I don't think I'm a creepy guy or someone you would get a restraining order against; this is girl used to mean something to me and I'll always love her and hope that she's happy doing whatever with whomever. Well anyways, we still get along great and there some signs of nostalgic feelings on both sides. I get that people change and what not but we still get along and I wanted to go through the whole process of getting to know someone again and all that sappy crap. We don't hang out much cause we're busy when whenever we try to make plans and the thought just flies over when someone is actually free so I decided to just text her those three dumb words. I didn't expect for us to get back together or anything special, I just wanted some closure like if I just told her how I feel, I wouldn't be thinking about it so much, but on the other hand, getting back together wouldn't be bad either. Yeah, I fucked up big and this is what this subreddit is for but she exhibits signs from time to time and she makes me have feelings like some naive high school fuck and falling in love again and the whole stupid process sounds really fun and let's add some more run ons and more run ons and more and more to this sentence. Again, I didn't expect much but her response was ""What"" ""What should I say to that"" and trying to avoid the whole situation altogether after that.

krogi,3,0,1r0mh2,3,"My shower hose has had a hole in it for quite some time now and it keeps getting bigger and therefore the pressure of the water stream lower. Being the amateur Mcgyver i am i decided it was time to take action. went to my room looking for a roll of duct tape i knew i had somewhere but after ten minutes of not finding it i looked for alternatives. only thing i could find was some double-sided tape and high strength superglue. two sides of tape seemed a little wastefull so i went for the glue.
stupid, stupid idea.. reeeeeally stupid idea.
i managed to patch the hole and everything seemed fine after i had let it dry a bit. turned the water on and ""hey would you look at that"" worked great, i thought.

now the bad shit begins.
after a few minutes i suddenly noticed my chest had a huge really red spot om it and quickly got out. my chest, back and even face was covered in a red rash of some sort. and it did not stop there of course nooo. this glue you see is not the gel like type, it is one of those watery thin ones that dry on contact and spread all over da fukin place. the water had diluted it slightly so it got into the hose and onto me, all over. when i got back in for a sec to turn the water off it just got worse. some of it had dripped down onto the tap and two of my fingers were stuck. jesus fuck that hurt!! 

so now here i am, red as a new cooked lobster with a little less skin on one hand than i prefer to have. just hope to crust this stuff is not as toxic as i think it might be...

Both of my roommates work at the local head shop thats right on the main strip of my town. On my way home i stopped by the shop to pick up this pipe i had been eyeing for awhile. I parked out back, went in grabbed the pipe, and broke it in with the boys in the basement. 

Fast-foward. Shop's closing and we are all headed out; this is when the trouble starts. The bikes not starting and I have no idea what to do. At this point it's too late to actually call someone, so I decide to just push it in the backdoor and leave it inside for the night. now it's not that i lived in a bad area and was worried about it being stolen, but rather i live in a college town where it wouldn't surprise me for some drunk asshole to just walk by and push it over. Either way the decision was made to push it inside, go on with the night, and figure it out in the morning.

Now, I am not a morning person at all so i just planned on going back to the shop a few hours after they open. This way I had time to sleep in then maybe get some breakfast. 

So i'm at home sleeping and my phone starts ringing and i'll usually silence my phone at least once before I'm actually awake, so it usually takes a few straight calls if you want to get ahold of me first thing in the morning.

It took me several hours to get it all cleaned up but we didn't have to deal with any cops. Not having to explain myself or interact with police at all was a huge plus on account of them making me extremely nervous. we basically just played dumb to the other businesses once i had it cleaned up.

Pineapple_Dreams,2,6,1qwmzi,14,"Not today, but more or so last month.  I woke up on a Sunday and had this urge to do something productive. After a little cleaning, I moved on to do laundry. I put all of my clothes in the wash except the the pair of pajama pants that I was wearing. 
It was still around noon when I got done and what's a better way to start off the day than breakfast?

So going through the fridge, I spot a pack of bacon.  Being hungry and it being breakfast, I couldn't really say no to bacon.  Within moments I was frying bacon on the stove with nothing on but pajama pants.  Very quickly, I started to get second thoughts but I was already too far in and couldn't back down to my tasty foe. It was just then when a big blob of bacon grease popped up and landed just on the right side of my right nipple. Jesus fucking Christ it felt like ten thousand suns just went supernova all over my nip.  I ended up not wanting to burn the fingertips of my precious gaming fingers and let the searing blob torment my nipple.

The aftermath made the betrayal of my tasty friend seem like a breeze.  My nipple would rub against every single shirt I would wear and bandaids didn't help at all.  It was a long week.

Lately, I have been obsessed with reading the top r/nosleep posts of all time. I have a girlfriend who aspires to be a writer and is into horror movies so I figured I would send her one of my favourite series-posts. Let me give you a rundown of how the r/nosleep story goes...

**SPOILERS** Basically, a health care worker is investigating the files of some strange mental patients of a hospital. Among the patients is an anorexic who becomes so desperate for food that she kills a man and eats his brains. Another patient is an ex-student who obsesses over a writing competition that could win her a full ride scholarship, stays up for days on end, and finally has a hallucination which causes her to kill two people. There are also other patients whose stories all come together in the the end to create a huge mind fuck. I recommend it to those who aren't squeamish
**SPOILERS END**

The kicker- my girlfriend is an ex-anorexic, insomniac, full-time student writer...

drtygrl,12,22,1qv1ss,61,"So, let me just preface this by saying, I'm fine this happens occasionally.

I woke up this morning around 8am, my hubs had said last night he wanted to sleep in this morning so he could stay up later tonight to watch football (Go Chiefs!) so I let him rest while I laid in bed finishing a book I had started and surfing around on Reddit for a bit. When I tried to get up to go pee I had quite a solid case of vertigo and bounced off the wall a few times getting to the toilet. I didn't think anything of it, like I said it happens. Around noon, I wake him up to go get some breakfast and some snack supplies for the game. 

He apparently woke up frisky, so he rolled over and started fingering me. Vertigo be damned, I am not turning down a frisky hubs. I let him continue for a few minutes, enjoying the attention. He sits up to reposition himself and I take that opportunity to give him a little mouth hug. In the process of sitting up too quickly (I know better than to do that when I'm already dizzy, I'm a nurse, yada yada) the room started spinning again. I, not being deterred from wanting to get some morning action, proceeded to go to town on his dick. No problem so far. I start to try to seductively slip off my panties and that's where I fucked up. 

The room spun, I fell over sideways (not sexy) and I ended up with a muscle cramp from the odd way I landed tangled up in my lacy undies. Me being my usual graceful and sexy self ended up in a complete giggle fit, like I was a 12 year old girl. That really was the end my getting any dick this morning.  My husband, god love him, is just watching the Stumbilina Olympics going on by his man bits, hoping I don't flail into him and take him down with me.

BurpleNurple,9,14,1qtvp2,43,"Okay, this was actually last week. But I was too busy fucking up other things to put my initial fuck-up into words.

It was Veterans Day at my school. Each year, we celebrate by inviting any parents/grandparents/great-grandparents/you-get-the-point to come to the ceremony. We sing some dramatic ***fuck yes America*** songs, have a few snotty middle schoolers speak, and give a slideshow on all the most recent wars in which the U.S. has been fighting.

So, the elementary school kids were all getting up from the bleachers to stand in front of us and sing a song. They walked single file behind their teachers. They looked like little ducklings with an insatiable eagerness in their eyes, an eagerness to sing about our country. Just kidding. They were really cute, though.

The kindergarten kids were walking up last, since they are obviously the cutest. Some kept getting distracted by the crowd, stopping to gaze upon the numerous high schoolers staring at them, having to be gently nudged by their teachers to keep walking.

This one girl, though. She was trying to walk in a straight line while simultaneously staring at the scary high schoolers. Needless to say, hilarity ensued. The girl fell RIGHT OVER on her face. I'd say you had to have been there, but I swore in that moment it sounded just like a giant 50-pound pancake belly-flopping into a pool of pure liquefied giggles. Just... FLOP. PLOP. SMACK. That girl went DOWN.

Unfortunately for me, this occurred at a rather unfortunate time: the kids had been walking up to sing while one of said snobby middle schoolers was reading off statistics about WWI. There were graphic pictures on the screen, too.

I started *dying*.

Shit is so much funnier when you're not supposed to be laughing at it, too.

After the initial burst of uncontrollable laughter, I kept snorting little giggles during the subsequent slide on WWII each time I thought about how I wasn't supposed to be laughing about that fucking kid. It sounded like I was giggling over how many casualties we had in WWII. Gah.

I digress. I uploaded a few to my computer, went to go put them in my secret folder labeled ""Jack-and-Jill.mkv"" and I could not find them. I had no idea where these little digital fuckers went.

ScorpioEverlast,19,24,1qsyl3,40,"So, there I was just sitting on a bench at my local mall minding my own business. Partaking in one of my favorite hobbies of people-watching.
about 10 minutes in a black prob 17-20 y/o set down not next to me but within conversational distance. After about 5 more minutes, a few of his friends came and chatted with him about Lebron vs Kobe, shoes, weed, ect ect ( typical black guy conversations ). Not 2 minutes after his friends left, he spoke up and asked me: ""Hey man, you wouldn't happen to have change for a $50 would you""? I replied without hesitation: ""IDK, let me check"".  

Now for some background. I usually am pretty quick-minded with situations. I pay attention to my surroundings. I often eves-drop into conversations taking place around me. And usually always keep myself out of precarious situations. BUT NOT TODAY!

I knew I had just cashed my payroll check a few hours ago and kept some cash on me. I knew I had a few $20s but didn't know if I could make the remaining $10. After a quick check in my wallet, I had the money in hand. 2 $20's, a $5, and 5 $1's. We traded bills and immediately I knew the bill wasn't right. The feel was wrong. So instantly placed it up against another bill and it was smaller in dimension. I then checked for the watermarks and there were none to be found. I instantly said to him: ""NO, I believe this bill is fake and I want my money back"". what took place next was a slow but steady escalation right in the middle of a crowded mall. 

He stood up and stated: ""Its not fake, I just got it from a store in change and need to break it to pay a friend back."" I stood up and blocked his progress of walking away. when we both stood up I realized what I was up against. This kid was a good 6 inches taller than me, easily 50lbs on me and at this point, angry that I had confronted/trapped him. 

Now I new that @ this point he was NOT getting out of my presence, NO MATTER WHAT! I also knew that it was his word against mine but that if worse came to worse, that we were or at least should be being recorded via CCTV.  

I again stated: ""this bill is fake and I want my money back NOW and you can walk away or I am calling security"". He then said: ""go ahead, you have the bill. Its your word against mine. You think they are going to believe me because I'm black and you're white?"" At this point I was getting pissed but had to keep my calmness or shit could get out of hand fast!

Immediately I yelled in a stern voice ""SECURITY"". We were within Earshot of the guest services booth thankfully and I know at least a half dozen people were watching at this point. He said: ""Hey man, I just got that. I didn't know it was fake. Let me go get them."" I said, No, its too late. I gave you the chance and you passed"". and Yelled ""SECURITY"" once more.

By this time, he was very nervous and trying numerous times to leave but i had him partially cornered between the bench we where on, a kiosk selling hair supplies, and the wall. I glanced over his shoulder and seen a very large man in a suit walking our way. The gentleman asked: ""what seems to be the issue"" and the kid tried to split once more and I sternly said: ""Do not let him leave!"" 

by this time a few more ""mall cops"" arrived and separated us and got both stories. I repeated what had happened while he still attempted to leave again. The man on the suit told him he was being retained and called for local PD. Not a minute later I repeated the incident to the officer. The officer then spoke with the kid. He obtained the bill from me and looked it over and stated it was def a fake. The kid tried to play dumb not knowing about the water marks and such. 

The officer didn't buy it, obtained the kids ID, spoke on his radio, then asked me how I would like to proceed. I told him that I gave him the option to get out of it and he passed. I asked the officer if he had the right to search the kid. He said NO. I then stated that he could have more bad bills on him. The officer then went back to the kid and asked for consent to search him. Like a scared kid, he said yes. The officer did a quick scan then took his wallet and sure enough. 4 more FAKE $50's! needless to say, the ball is in my court!

The officer immediately arrested the kid and read him his rights! HE was pissed!! cussing and yelling obscenities at me. 

It was at this time that a was flooded with different emotions. Knowing I fucked up by trying to be a good patron. The potential for the situation to end way worse for me. And the overwhelming feeling that I did right by standing my ground and busting this asshole!

I immediately went and got a soda to cure my crazy cotton mouth and left the mall. Now, a few hours later. looking back, The way I handled the situation has given me a great deal of confidence in my ability to handle a situation with a stranger. I do know this feeling could very well one day make things worse for my but for now, I feel great! but I still FUCKED UP!

I can't get up. I am surrounded by people. I will die of embarrassment. To make things worst, I happen to be at the most popular starbucks in town, so it's not going to get any better AND I am seated as far as possible from the bathroom. 

The longer I sit here, the longer I am going to leak, not to mention linger in my own crap. 

What really chaps my ass is that it is the MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING MONTH. I should not be having my period. Plus, I am one of the most constipated person you could ever meet. I usually have to lean to the side and rock for a good fifteen minutes in hopes to pass a bowel movement. 

Ain't this some bullshit.

I don't know what to do you guys. 

Damnit.... 

**TL;DR** : I am at Starbucks and my silent but deadly poot turned out to be a sneaky basTERD. As I get up to go to the bathroom, I realize I started my period in the chair. I am seemingly a mile from the bathroom. I'm still in the chair.

**UPDATE FOR THOSE INTERESTED** : Okay, so just as I was about to get up and I had convinced myself to be mature about it this girl comes and sits RIGHT next to me. She decides to linger around and do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING on Facebook for what seemed like FOR.EV.ER (45minutes or so). There was no way I was getting up and cleaning it up with her RIGHT THERE beside me, so yeah, I just set there (im)patiently and marinated in my juices. 

After she finally got the fuck up--I don't know why I am so mad at her; its not her fault I can't control my bodily functions--I put on my game face to figure out how to do this discreetly as possible. Just as I stand up, this guy decides that he likes what he sees and hits on me. I quickly pulled my jacket down over the stain and tried to reject him as politely and quickly as possible, but he was one of those persistent motherfuckers. Damn me and my v-neck shirts.

After, he left, I walked what seemed like a mile to the bathroom in the still fairly populated cafe. Once I was in the restroom, I discovered somewhat of good news. I actually had not sharted on myself; it was a blood clot (sorry if that's graphic, but at least it's not feces, right?). Thinking back on it, i don't know how I got those two holes mixed up, but my entrance is pretty close to the exit, so yeah.

Moving along, I had just changed book-bags, so no tampons or pads on me, so I decide to improvise, and use a shitload of paper-towels. Then, I stripped down and blow dried my pants. The stain was hardly noticeable anyways since I was wearing black bottoms, but I didn't want to stain any more chairs. 

Then, I grabbed some napkins and soaked them in the leftover water I had from earlier and went to work. It was a pleather type of material, so I managed to get most of the stain out with the help of some hand sanitizer. I like to think I played it off fairly well. For all they knew, I had just spilled some mocha.... I think I can actually show my face in there again.

Everything's going to be okay. Good thing I don't have any friends!

**Last Update (Morning After** : So, I went to Starbucks this morning. It is insanely busy, especially for a Sunday. I figured more people would be at church. Well, guys, I didn't clean it as well as I thought. The wetness from the water and sanitizer must have made it look less noticeable last night because this am, the stain is clearly still red. On a bright side, it was the only seat not taken, so I guess I'll never have to worry about not having a spot to sit down at least.

tapittuco,13,20,1qsa0l,28,"I know, you've never heard that before...Anyway, it was last night, my wife got a promotion and we decided, ""Friday night, why not get drunk?"". So that was the case.

I think it was about 1 A.M. (maybe 1:30 ish A.M.), and we stumble up the stairs to our new apartment, first thing I go do is take a piss, naturally. As I open the door there she is, just a shirt on, and through my blurred vision, I make out what appears to be something around her waist...her strap-on.

She starts pushing me back into the bed with supernatural strength and pushed me backwards onto the bed and ripped off my jeans, and-fucked me like never before...without any lube. I felt like Jonah Hill (only less fat) in ""This is the End"", now there's usually nothing wrong-but once again, **she didn't use any lube**, no spit either.

After she had her way with me, I lied on that bed, writhing in pain because she treated my ass like no man I've been with (oh, I'm bisexual if you haven't picked that up yet, but I do know of some straight men who let their girlfriends/wives peg them) and at the same time in a ""the best orgasm I've had in my life [*so far*]"" coma. I fell off the bed and was lying on the cold floor when she threw a towel at me and said: ""Use this to clean up you filthy whore.""

The next thing I remember is stumbling to my truck and heading off to work. When I got there some friend who lives below us (unfortunately) was teasing me and bothering the shit out of me (HA! Not likely, oh the burning...) to tell the two other guys in the office why I was walking so weird when I shouted (without the knowledge of my boss entering right behind us) ""OKAY!

I passed by the tyre section of the shop and noticed a beautifully presented case of windscreen wipers. They were good quality ones, Bridgestone, compared to the worn 'imported' eBay ones currently on my car. My current ones were ok, they were a bit noisy but I had no reason to change. I figured I could put something decent on her for once and splurged the £13 ($35) for a set of two. 
I got her home and figured I would fit them right away! This is the point when I remember that life isn't fair and no matter what youre doing you'll be able to find a way to fuck it up. So, the first wiper went on no issue.  I began on the second. It was a bit more difficult to get off but I got there in the end.

I love my ass. It's a ton of fun to play with. You put things in, you take things out, this makes your 'me' time is so much better. As a guy, it's the only way to get in touch with your inner self and I think it's fascinating to say the least.

But today, this was the reason I was mentally preparing a makeshift will. I'm only 18 and I pretty much have nothing to do all day unless I'm working. Obviously if you have the house to yourself, you start to get creative with what you jerk to/with/how. Living at home still trying to get to school or something, I work odd hours. Today I was going to be working 1:30 to 10:00.

I felt particularly kinky today and decided that I wanted to test my colon's absorption ability.

I've gotten drunk once before, and had a beer or two maybe six other times. I clearly don't know how my body handles alcohol very well, let alone unfiltered anus liquor.

But this doesn't cross my mind. I just want to get a bit of a buzz this morning.

Warning: unfiltered ass play ahead
-------------

10:30a I have my shot of vodka in one of those tiny rum bottles and a straw.

I know my plan: create fart, insert bottle and swap fart for shot.

But things aren't perfect. The straw is tearing my asshole a new asshole. It's not that bad though, so I just tough the initial pain out and bend over on my knees and let gravity pull some air in.

Then I replace my straw for the bottle while standing and get back on my knees. Watching my reflection in our full length mirror I shove my ass almost perpendicular to the floor and both legs spread to see the view. I relax my abs and suddenly the bottle is now empty.

Wow. I feel nothing. I expected a little bit of a tingle or burn, but there's nothing. That is, until I take the bottle out. My anus seems to be the only thing that realises what a bad idea this is and screams a signal of pain on contact with the alcohol. Not cool. But whatever; I'm just gonna let the rest of it get absorbed so it won't touch my anus any more! Foolishly I want to jerk something fierce. A small shampoo thing gets to spend quality time with me. In it goes and off I get.

Unfortunately it slips out and a splash of anus burning liquid follows before I clamp shut. It burns. That's not good. ^^Oh. This probably wasn't a great idea. [I'm out.](http://cdn.chud.com/1/1f/295x221px-LL-1f759989_Jerry-Seinfeld-Leaving1.gif)

I'm getting to the toilet and feel the pressure of the leftover makeshift fart coming on. Apparently I took in more air than I thought.

Do you remember the burning of diarrhoea? Only having a shot worth of this is fantastic, because every drip leaving feels like letting satan poke my pink. Followed immediately after is a 20 second fart that feels like heaven. But all is not well in colon town. Head office has noticed a disturbance. An off balance. Some huge negative feedback loop starts the process of removing this foreign substance from my digestive tract, and starts doing some natural laxative shit to me.

Now I'm feeling waves of discomfort as my bowels rustle and shimmy shit at breakneck speeds to the throne. I'm now a hot mess of shit, vodka, and worry.

But the first wave is over and I'm feeling a little off but okay. So I lay down and rest a bit and think about what I've done.

My mind jumps to the idea of liver failure and within seconds I'm googling the symptoms. But I'm pretty much okay. I rest until I'm ready to go to work and for at least another 30 minutes I'm okay.

But the shits start again when I get to work. More gurgles and stuff make me run for the toilet every little while. I also started feeling a bit bloated, making me think that my liver was backing up and being problematic.

To make a long story shorter, a super fart after many mucusy damaged anus poops made me feel on top of the world. For the four hours there, though, I was certain I shocked my liver to failure or something.

Never doing that again.

TL;DR

I like my butt so I put vodka in my butt. My butt didn't like that and shot it and everything in my poop tubes straight out.

On the walk, the high really kicked in and I started what can only be described as Olympic fast-walking. Like [this](http://www.thewalkingsite.com/images/racewalk/50kleadpack.bmp). My legs hurt, but I was at a high where I felt nothing could stop me physically. We get to the movies, I order the tickets wearing light blue sunglasses at night inside. I felt like the true douche of the room already. I order the tickets and get snacks while my friend went pre-show. I got two large sodas, two medium popcorns and 3 bags of candy. They were suspicious already. My friend and I take out seats at the last row and get ready for the previews. It takes forever, but the movie starts and we couldn't be more pumped. 20 minutes in, we've finished all of our food and are munched out out of our minds. My friend says, ""we need more.""

For no reason whatsoever, I start doing my Olympic fastwalk up the stairs. But, like before, I couldn't stop myself. Lo and behold, I trip on the stairs, my two popcorn bags so splattering everywhere, and I'm on the floor like a brainless baboon trying to get up. I do, people snicker and chuckle, and I blush, chuckling myself. ""Sorry,"" I whisper. I had nothing else to say. I did the walk of shame out of there and back down the longest hallway known to man. I tell the custodians and they say they'll take care of it. But, they're minimum wage job isn't worth the trouble, so they don't clean it up.

epatti0914,43,27,1qp0l7,54,"**TL;DR:** Girlfriend of a year broke up with me after heated argument because I wouldn't tell her a surprise.

Okay, just for starters and for my spitefulness, the surprise was I was going to be taking my girlfriend of almost a year to the beach for a picnic that I was going to cook and was going to play a song I had written her towards the end of it.  Call it lame or cliche, I really have no arguments against it.


Now I knew that she hated surprises, well more of KNOWING there was a surprise without knowing what it was.  But at one point she was going through some serious depression and when the idea sparked I kinda just casually mentioned that if I could get it all together, I'd do something nice for her.  It made her happy and that's all that mattered.

Then came the constant asking.  ""Tell me what it issss!  Pleeeeease???""  ""Tell me!""  ""Oh, come oooonnn.""  I just laughed it off because I thought she was just trying to be cute.  Oh how wrong I was.  Last night around midnight or so we're on Skype and I just told her no again and I hear her vigorously typing to her friend... I ask her what about and she decides to vent to me how annoyed she is that I'm not telling her about her surprise.  You know.  Because IT'S A FUCKING SURPRISE.  

Now from time to time I can be quite stubborn and have a bit of a temper... I do my best to fix this in relationships by removing myself so we can both composure and we can come back and talk things out.  This was no exception, and I told her I'd talk to her later while I tried to think it out... this is greeted by her calling me five minutes later and blowing up on me and saying how selfish I'm being.  It continues to get more and more heated so she decides to hang up the phone.  Of course, this fun game continues for hours of us trying to get the other to see their side of things by talking over each other.  

She tells me that she'd rather not have whatever it is at all if I'm not going to tell her.  I said fine, less work for me to do.  *Jesus fuck what beast have I awoken?*  I could've put the phone on the other end of the room and heard every word as if she were sitting next to me.  Eventually she hangs up when I decide to share my piece (albeit I wasn't exactly speaking calmly back).  

It finally concludes when she tells me maybe we should take a break.  Been there, done that.  I don't do breaks and respond by saying if she wants to end, then nut up and end it.  So she does.

I work at a church as a videographer/media producer type thing and I need a shot of a candle on a black backdrop. 

I head upstairs and grab a candle, it is a simple white one. I also grab a lighter, and then head back to the studio downstairs to start shooting.

I start trying to light the candle, and it doesn't smell good and it's starting to spark, I just assume this is one dumb-ass candle and it will light eventually. 

After a couple minutes of failure, my coworker comes into the room and asks what's that smell. I tell him it's this candle that isn't lighting, he comes and grabs the candle from me and looks at the bottom and just starts laughing.

TingDodge,1,18,1qng8z,0,"This ended up being longer than I thought it would. Enjoy the read.

Actually happened yesterday but I forgot to post. 

Context: I'm a junior in high school. I will be 17 next month. Every once in a while, my friends and I like to be assholes.

At my school, my regular group of friends consists of about 10-15 people. We do things others won't because we don't care. Whether it's being loud, inciting riots, or terrorizing freshmen... One of my friends - we'll call him ""K"" - brought a box of condoms to school to hand out to freshman. It makes them nervous, especially the ones that think they're tough shit. 

So at lunch (circa 10:30 a.m.) K hands some of us a couple condoms. I give out a few, much to the enjoyment of asshole me. We have a couple left and I know just who I want to mess with. 

There's a kid at my school that was insanely awkward Freshman and Sophomore year. But at the end of last year, he started smoking weed and now thinks he's tough shit. However, he's still the same old, awkward ""P.""

I wanted to give my last one to P just to fuck with him. It's somewhat of a tradition to fuck with P because although he's awkward, he's an asshole. I couldn't find P anywhere for the rest of the day. So as the day goes on, I forget about the condom in my front right jeans pocket. 

I get home that day, take off my clothes, and put on some gym shorts and a t-shirt. Later, my dad's girlfriend will do my laundry. We will call her ""Ka."" Sure enough at about 6 p.p. Ka asks me for my hamper so I bring it to the laundry room. I then eat dinner, take a shower, and watch Netflix. 

About an hour later, I realized I never took the condom out of my jeans. I go to the laundry room but my clothes are already in the washer or dryer. Later, Ka brings my clean laundry to my room (I'm sort of spoiled in this aspect.) Immediately, I check the pockets. No condom. See, it's not a big deal if Ka knows I had a condom. She's offered to get me condoms, take a friend she thought I was having sex with to planned parenthood, etc. BUT, my dad - the man who had 4 kids by age 28 (me at 20) would most likely lecture me about sex. I hate lectures. Well this morning I'm getting ready to walk down to my bus stop and my dad stops me. 

I end up getting a 15 minute lecture about sex and why I shouldn't be doing it and if I am, that I should be safe. It was *awful*. You see, neither my dad or mom know I lost my virginity the summer before Freshman year. It was painful. ""Is it *insert friend*?"" ""Are you being safe?"" ""How many times?""

dgavb,11,12,1qndv1,54,"Okay, so this happened last Tuesday. I apologize it didn't happen today. If you really want, I'll do it again.

My friends and family know me as a long shitter. I've been known to make people wait an hour for me while I take a shit. My family is concerned, and told me to see a doctor about this, but dammit I'm a man. Men don't need help. 

So my day starts off normal, like any other day. I have a simple daily routine, I have a simple class schedule. Everything is so precise and put to together at my school. Since everything is so precise I never have enough time to shit.

This always lead to problems.

When school ended that day, my friend Matt asked me if I wanted to go to a coffee shop and work on some homework. I think why the hell not, I'm always getting coffee. So I go with him a few miles out of my school to grab a bite to eat and purchase some delicious black coffee. I chug that cup down like a muthafucka.

I still have not shit yet, and this coffee makes it even worse. Here I am at the table, trying to do my math homework while I'm farting loud as fuck. I think: shit, I don't wanna crap my pants.

I tell Matt I'm gonna go take a shit real quick.

I go over to the bathroom stall, and release myself. Little did I know that I was out of toilet paper. That was the lesson I learned that day: always check the stall first.

Anyways, I have to think quick. I know that outside of the stall there is a paper towel dispenser. So I thought the best idea would be to scurry over to that fucker, grab a handful of paper towels and clean the mess I've made.

The shit I took was not a normal shit, it was a wet sloppy mess... So I didn't want to get my pants all dirty. I decided the best thing to do was run out naked really really quick.

I wiggle a bit and get all of the shit off of mount butt crack and I and sprint like a bear at a unicycle store. (Bears like unicycles right?) As I'm running I hear the door of the bathroom stall open.

I'm standing half naked in the middle of the bathroom while this dude walks.

He walks in, looks at me and just stares.

For a good fucking 10 seconds it was just silence. I then think I need to say something quick.

""Wow! It's really hot today isn't it?!""

Fuck. Alright. I fucked up again. He nods and slowly walks out of the bathroom and I proceed to go back to the stall and wipe my ass in shame.

Well, one night we were skyping and as usual, and being cute she asked me to just talk about random stuff or make up a wee story to help her to sleep, which I did gladly. About half an hour after she fell asleep though, she woke up, looked into the camera and said ""I love you"".

Now, I thought this was really sweet, I fell asleep with a massive smile on my face.

Now, this is where the fuck up was, she mentioned the other day that she woke up so happy after it, but couldn't for the life of her remember what I was talking about, that's fine since she was falling asleep.

Today, she was feeling sad (as well as anxiety, she occasionally gets hit with depression) and so to cheer her up, I thought I'd tell her about waking up to say ""I love you"" and falling asleep again.

I definitely don't wear granny panties but at work I usually wear pretty generic bikini style panties that are comfortable and don't ride up with all the work I do.



So I was stumbling around like a morning breath zombie today looking for my work clothes.  Of course I can't find any clean underwear.  Finally, I spy a pair of gray boyshorts on the floor-passes the smell test=clean.  I noticed there was a small (pencil eraser sized) hole in the crotch, but that's no big deal, not like anyone will see them.  So I suit up and don't think twice about it, and head to work. 



As my day gets going and I'm walking all over the place and moving around a lot, I start to feel unhappy in the underpants region.  Something feels weird, like pinching or chafing.  I am really busy so I discretely try and do the pinch and pull to get the fabric away from my crotch and keep going about my work.  But no, that's only a very temporary fix.  The discomfort is becoming worse, and almost painful to the point that I'm kind of starting to walk spread legged and keep trying to squat a bit and am trying hard to keep a grimace off my face.



Finally I get a moment to hobble to the bathroom and pull down my pants in front of the mirror.  It was that hole.  That goddamned hole.  And peeking out of the hole, angry, was a part of one of my pussy lips, like a tiny angry thumb.  And let me clarify yall, I don't have huge dangly lips.   But somehow it had gotten itself through the hole in the fabric and gotten itself stuck there.  It was almost PURPLE and not feeling good.  You know how it feels when you put a rubber band around your finger?  Yeah.  *But on my labia.* 



So then I had the joy of pulling my pussy lip out of my underwear hole which DID NOT FEEL GOOD.  It was chafed and swollen (not in the good way) from being crammed in that hole.  Then I was faced with what to do with my underwear.  I knew I couldn't keep wearing them, so I had to figure out how to smuggle my panties out of the bathroom all the way back to my purse in my locker without anyone seeing, and then spent the rest of the day mortified that anytime I opened my locker, my panties would fall out.

domenow,76,110,1qk3cy,246,"...thereby missing a class that the professor told me I really can't afford to miss any more days of. And, just to clarify: that would be 17 full blown orgasms, and 2 half orgasms.

It was 12:20, and I had to be out of the house by 1. I was right about to shower when I suddenly got in the mood. I swear, I don't plan these things.

I quickly mapped it out in my mind: Get in shower with vibrator and phone (for pornographic purposes), don't turn the water on so your phone doesn't get ruined, get just one orgasm, and leave the shower at exactly 12:40. You'll have just enough time to make it to class.
Usually, I knock out about 2-3 and that alone takes me 45 minutes, but today was completely different. The first one came rolling in at around 10 minutes in, the 2nd took me a mere 5. (Remember, I had my phone with me, and I was basically staring at the time to avoid losing track of it). I thought ""There's no way I'll make it to a 3rd, but I have 5 more minutes. I'll just enjoy the time I have left"". I had completely forgotten to factor in time to actually shower. The third one came....at 12:41. ""There, you might be a minute late, but you made good time"", I thought. ""Let's just wait until the amazing post-orgasm feeling goes away. Yeah, sure, keep it on while this happens. Why not?""

I can safely say that this is the point where all logic left me. No longer was I stringing together coherent sentences in my mind. It then became...a race against time. ""I came so quickly the last 3 times, maybe I can put on the first item of clothing I see and still be on time"". 4th orgasm. 5th orgasm. 6th orgasm. I was coming every 2-5 minutes. This never happens, and I told myself it would be a sin to stop now. ""6? You want to stop after 6? Why not hit the lucky number 7? That'll be the last one, promise"". 7th orgasm. ""You never really did like odd numbers. See if you can go for 8. 8th orgasm. 9th orgasm. ""Okay, so you'll be fifteen minutes late to class. You'll make it, don't worry, Don't you want to make it to the double digits?"" 10th orgasm. 11th orgasm. (I forgot where I had the two half orgasms, somewhere in between 10-17 I think).

When did I realize class wasn't happening? I'd say at some point between the 11th and 13th orgasm. I'm inclined to say 13th, because that's when the intense self-loathing started. ""So this is what you do all day, huh? Touch yourself?""
Indeed, it was precisely when I came to the realization that I wasn't going to make it to class that it went from enjoyable to pitiful. It became, ""There! Take that! Have another orgasm, you fucking better to make up for the fact that you missed yet another class. Isn't this what you wanted all along? Just another orgasm?""
Immediately following the 15th, it started to feel like razor blades were attacking my clitoris. I thought of a couple jokes to tell my friends. ""My clit looks like it grew another clit, that's how swollen it is"". But it was too late to stop then - I had to do it to ""make up for"" the fact that I had missed a very important class. I kept going, because I felt I deserved the pain. Deserved what was coming to me. Unfortunately, they were coming much slower this time around, and didn't last nearly as long.

Loved the result, did not love the itching that followed, never did it again despite wanting to. Well yesterday I decided it was finally time, but perhaps just a trim instead of going bare. So instead of doing it as before I went and bought a proper bodygrooming device, this particular model having trimmers at one end and a shaving foil at the other. [Picture](http://stuffmideast.com/wp-content/uploads/Philips-BodyGroom-Pro.jpg). At either side on the shaving foil end it also has some of the little blades like on a trimmer, which you can see on the picture. These would be my downfall.

So this morning I'm using the trimmer and all is going well; trim a bit, turn it off, clean hair, turn back on and repeat. Then I got to the bit inbetween the base of the shaft and my right leg, which was proving difficult to cut. Difficult as in it was like the trimmer wasn't even turned on, but it was because I could hear it! Then I felt a horrible, *horrible* pain at the base of the head, like someone very quickly running a serrated blade across my dick. I yelped and dropped the shaver to the shower floor. My dick now had a small cut that was bleeding, and holy fuck did it sting. My educated guess is that the trimmer wasn't cutting because I had pushed the power button for the shaving end by mistake, and one of those little (now operational) blade parts on the side of the shaving foil had contacted my skin sideways. They're not supposed to contact the skin sideways.

Obviously I was in no state to put that whirling death machine anywhere near my junk again, and I don't know when I'll have the ~~balls~~ courage to finish the job. I spent the next hour with a bandage and some frozen peas on my dick.

effse7en,5,14,1qhvgk,21,"So today was my IRL cakeday (yaaay...), and I was going to go to Starbucks before work for my free drink, but I woke up too late to get there before work. Fuck up #1

I showed up for work, and I had a car on my rack that I left there last night (I'm a mechanic). I lowered it down and was checking the brakes and tires to see if I could sell anything on it, and when I went to lower my lift all the way down to check the interior, nothing happened. No response from the controls at all. I couldn't raise it, lower it, or drop it onto the locks. I sent in a help desk ticket, told my manager and team leader, and just kind of stood around since we had and extra open lift, but literally no other tickets to work on. Well, about three hours later, when I was finally working on something else, my manager comes by, looks at my lift controls (which are under a desk/work area thing), and he just goes ""hey, who unplugged your lift"". Internal facepalming ensued, he plugged the rack controls back in, and it worked, of course. Fuck up #2.

So, as I'm pulling up to my house, the trash can is behind my Miata, in the spot where I park my xD (today was trash day). I got out, set it aside, and parked. As I'm walking up to the house, I grab the trash can and begin to drag it behind me, halfway in the grass/dirt mixture that passes for our front yard, and halfway on the driveway. As I'm dragging it behind me, it hits a bit of grass or dirt or something and swerves to my left, straight into the tail light on my girlfriend's civic, which is already overdue for state inspection by two months (intact tail lights are an inspection item in Texas). The tail light shatters, and I throw the pieces in the conveniently placed trash can. I apologize profusely and just had to spend 50 bucks on a new OEM tail light from ebay. Fuck up #3.

I see a cop heading in the opposite direction and my first thought is ""Oh shit I haven't been paying attention to my speed"". I look down and my heart sinks. I was going 50mph in a 30mph zone. The cop passes me and I look in my rear view mirror and to my horror so that he is applying his brakes. I get to an intersection and turn into a parking lot just before it and then turn onto a side street. The whole time im doing this im thinking ""What are you doing stop!"", ""You need to stop!"".

senseiaj,22,44,1qgwmi,120,"I'll start of the story with why I was in such a jumpy mood. At about 6:30 this morning I started having this weird dream where my backyard was covered in spiderwebs and I started picking at the strings of one to get it to fall so that I could get across the yard and back into the house.

I think I was at the point where I was half-dreaming and half-awake and I swear to God I felt this big-ass spider land straight on my face in the dream and in real life at the same time. I instantly woke up and freaked out and jumped out of bed, and the ""spider"" flew off of me and onto the bed. I must have hallucinated because I swear I could actually see the spider there on the bed for a few seconds and then it vanished. The feel of it on my face and seeing it felt so real that I'm still not %100 sure that it didn't actually happen

After that living nightmare I decided I could no longer go back to sleep and went downstairs to take a shower. I started the shower up and took a piss in the toilet, then as I look over the the basket of towels by the shower there's this big ass brown spider right on one of the towels. Deciding to be brave I lift the towel up and dangle it over the toilet and try to shake the spider off.

This spider definitely lifts and would not come off of the towel so I shook really hard and lost grip of the towel and of course it landed straight in the piss-water in the toilet. My immediate reaction was to grab the dry end of the towel and lift it out, and then of course the spider started running up the tower towards me to I let go of the tower and got piss everywhere. 

I then ran out of the bathroom ass-naked (luckily no-one was downstairs yet) grabbed a cup and trapped the bugger. To my credit I am not usually terrified of spiders but I do live in an area with brown recluses and this one looked too big to be a garden spider to me, although it most likely was not a brown recluse either. Most embarrassing part is that I am a full-grown twenty year old man.

At about 9 I went into the shower, and came up with this brilliant idea to use the shampoo as lube. This was the first time I had done it, so I didn't really know what to do. I ended putting the shampoo on the head of my dick, and closing my foreskin around it, (uncircumcised), and began doing the dirty deed. 

After it was finished, I got out of the shower, dried myself and about an hour later I went to take a piss. 

When I took aim, my dick hurt, curious about it, I inspected my penis, looking for any signs. There were none, so I proceeded to urinate. But nothing came out, and that's when I realised that the shampoo I had used had in fact, went into my dick hole, therefore clogging it so that nothing but a few bubbles could come out.

AnOriginailName,11,7,1qfw2x,13,"So I’m relatively new to Reddit but here's a shameful story that, although ended somewhat triumphantly, was a personal defeat.  This story is long and happened awhile back but I think a good one. I went camping with some friends and we just got back from drunken canoeing so we were extremely hungry. We started the fire and cooked burgers and hot dogs. While waiting for the food to cook we drank and smoked. After the festivities, we ate to our drunken hearts content. Unfortunately, the pre game upset my stomach and for some reason caused me to only have partial control over my bladder. I don't know if the beer, or beer mixed with smoking caused this reaction but I couldn't hold in the undercooked food. So minutes later I can sense the explosive embarrassment wanting to project everywhere. I calmly collected my sporadic thoughts and told everyone ""be right back, going the bathroom."" Luckily I got out of the shelter/cabin without anyone noticing the shit that was about to come out my ass. At this point my inner anguish is nervously creeping toward the surface and I become the worlds speed walking champion with ass cheeks clenched tight enough to hold a needle as I dash toward the bathroom. It was nighttime so my inner ninja kept telling me ""you did it /r/AnOriginailName!!!!,no can see you walking idiotically....we're going to make it!!!!"" But...I failed and shit myself. The plopping noises of poop bubbles continued with every shameful step to the bathroom, which thankfully was empty. So there I sat, a defeated and ashamed 22 year old that just shit his pants. As every minute passed, the smell of burgers, hot sauce, hotdogs, beer, and bad times heighten my self-embarrassment. I kept telling myself that if I walked back to the campground it would be obvious by the smell and sight that I had shit myself. So I crafted a plan to prevent myself from being the humor for the next couple of years. Frantically I began to wipe my trunks furiously with toilet paper removing the brown matter from my clothing. However, my actions were futile and caused a now smeared and worse mess. I was at rock bottom...and my dignity was near gone BUTT (hehe) then I remembered! Earlier in the morning I had used someone’s shampoo they had left behind when I took a shower in the campground showers. This was my ace in the whole! So I wiped my ass and slowly crept around the corner in Pink Panther fashion avoiding any human contact. I open the shower door and…the shampoo is gone. FUCK! So I open the next shower…nothing...I was getting hopeless and then YES!...the next shower over had a bar of soap. Now normally I don't ever…EVER, use some strangers random bar of soap…especially at a campground with hundreds of people but I had no choice (I’m just weird and feel grossed out that someone had possibly rubbed their sweaty balls with that soap but I guess I was about to do worse). I got on my knees and scrubbed until there were no more brown stains on my trunks. I washed my butt cheeks to their natural color and triumphantly stood proud knowing I avoided complete embarrassment. Drunken head held high, I walked out of that shower feeling like a man but what goes up must come down.  While still in a drunken stupor I aimlessly walked back to my campsite and stepped on a thorn bush with all my weight (I was barefoot during this entire fiasco). At the time I was so drunk that a thorn going straight into my toe felt like a little prick but the next day proved me wrong. The thorn had gone in deeper than I realized and caused me to develop a slight pimp lean to avoid any pressure on my left toe (the toe closest to the big toe). So although I avoided embarrassment I still didn't win because walking for the next couple of weeks sucked. Any pressure on that toe felt like the thorn was being re-inserted into the same spot but hey…no one knows I shit myself expect yall. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR Drunken canoeing, smoking, and eating undercooked food made me a walking diarrhea dispenser and although public embarrassment was avoided, a painful pimp lean was developed.

""That'll be £60 please.""

""Oh, I've already paid.""

""Sorry who did you pay with?""

""That short asian guy over there."" - With a smile on her face.

So I smile, laugh, and say ""Okay, thats fine then"", and let her be on her way with her pizzas.

-------------------------------------
**The aftermath for those interested**:

Later that night (1am so technically the morning), my manager called me saying

""We're £60 short (on our system), do you have any idea where it went? Maybe you put some money in a different till, or put some in your pocket by mistake?""

I said, ""No, not that I know of. I don't have any money on me.""

**-Next Day-**

He phoned me again at 10am saying

""I've just watched some CCTV footage, and it shows you giving the pizzas away without a payment.""

So yeah it ends with the manager asking for a deposit from me (the full £60), just until he sorts the situation out, and gets the money back from her. He is going to bring the police into this.

We are not gonna let this bitch get away with that. She actually committed a crime, and even though it was my fault for not properly checking to see if she'd paid, she basically stole from us.

**Update: Some Good News**

Manager called me into his office today, he told me the woman paid up!

[No need for me to pay!] (http://www.troll.me/images/teblow/time-to-celebrate-and-i-will.jpg)

He basically told her that we have footage of her. Also we have no receipt of payment. She also said that she couldn't find her receipt... ^^I ^^wonder ^^why.

Kursawow,19,10,1qbcv5,8,"It actually happened Friday but whatever, its starting to hit the fan today.  
So Friday I went to go help a friend I've had for about half a year go dress shopping for her debutant ball, or some big dance. Things were going platonic until time came where we had to go our separate ways, then it changed.  
I'm not entirely sure how, or why it happened but we ended up kissing, all the while my girlfriend is slaving away as a cashier at Wal-Mart.  
Needless to say I instantly regretted it post kiss, and my friend did too. We both said it happened, and we said it ""never happened"".  
Then this morning I awaken to a message saying how much of a bad idea it all was, and how I broke everyone's trust, my friends, and most importantly my girlfriends, and my friend didn't want anything to do with me for a while.  
Now I totally agree with her, I was the biggest of cocks doing what I did, and I have no idea how to make amends to my friend, and my girlfriend without her knowing what I did, and I know I need to. I will never be able to live this down, or forgive myself for it, but I feel like I need to do something to magically fix it all.  
I guess the point of this post is just for me to vent a bit, I hope someone can help me out with ideas what I should do.",TIFU by kissing a woman who isn't my girlfriend.,18
PinkBootedBandit,158,194,1qb629,306,"this will be long and messy, sorry im on my 15 min break.

i took my gf (lets call her jessica) of 2 months to a party last night.  it happened that the party was in the same culdesac as her moms husband.  her mom was separated from her husband (not my gfs father) and lived with jessica in an apartment 15 miles away.  but now jessicas mom is moving back in with the husband and its only a matter of time till jessica is moving which means she will lose her job, she has no car.  

jessica already has problems with her mother, her mom assaulted her and constantly verbally abuses her.  they havent spoken in weeks, she abandoned jessica at 3 months of age in france and contacted her last year saying she wanted to make up for lost time.  

so replaying last night, jessica and i are leaving the party and we get in my car which is parked in the culdesac.  who drives by but her mom.  she even circled around to get a better look.  jessica told me to leave, so i did.  10 minutes later jessicas phone rings, she has a voicemail.  her mom is yelling at her acusing her of threatening her family and saying that if anything happens to her family or house she is telling the cops it was her and she wants the apartment key under her door tomorrow.  essentially shes kicking her out.  jessica is 24 and im 21.  she has no obligation to house her.  

after listening to the msg she starts crying hysterically and tells me the reasons why she cant go back to france (basically her dad who raised her wasnt her biological dad and told her to leave).  she cries all the way home and i tell her to grab her work clothes (we work at the same place) and can sleep with me tonight.  (i live with an aunt, my mom died 6 months ago and im finishing school.)

this morning when we woke to go to work she shows me an apartment nearby for 450$ 1 bedroom.  i have no idea what to say and told her we work part time and cant afford that.  i was thinking, ""we are together for 2months.  this is too fast"". 


so now i fear she will be homeless while im sleeping in my warm bed being selfish.  i didnt tell my aunt my gf was sleeping with me last night and i doubt she would be ok with it.  im knee deep in shit and dont know what to do.  i like her alot but i wouldnt say im in love.

tldr: toom gf to party, her crazy mom saw us and thought we were in the neighborhood to threaten her family.  kicking gf out of her house/life.  gf asks me to move in together.  im 21, not done with school and work part time.  she makes less than me.



edit: talked to her, she agreed that it wasnt a good idea to move in together. she starts looking for a full time job tomorrow.  as of now the locks on the appt havnt been changed.  thanks for the advice.  im not dumping her but i let her know im willing to help, but not to the point of it hurting me.

bbq-chips,14,8,1qahu5,46,"Now I've been a stand-up ass-wiper for all of my life. I never could fathom how somebody could sit down and wipe their ass. Not for the life of me. But after today, I'm folding. I have to learn to do this now.

And here's why.

It all started when I was sitting at the computer listening to Soundgarden's Superunknown album, smoking a bowl of the finest kush I could find here in Halifax. I suddenly got hit with punch in the stomach. Now I've been drinking all day, so it might have been the beer, might have been the pork-chops or maybe even the potatoes. I can't cook potatoes.

So I went to the bathroom.

I took my shit, it was a mess. I was thankful I didn't shit my pants this time around because it has happened a couple of times in the last couple of years. I blame having Crohn's disease.

Once depleting my bowls in a sanitary manner, I stood up as usual to wipe my ass, to put it lightly. I never learned how to wipe my ass when I was younger sitting down and to be frank it was quite awkward how I wiped my ass up until I was 16. We had a vertical mirror in our bathroom in the house I grew up in so I would turn around from it and bend my upper-body downwards and wipe my ass literally upside-down. When my family moved after I turned 16, I had to learn to cope without a mirror in the wash-room. I learned my standing up.

So as I wiped my ass on this very night in a ""drunken stupor,"" (Rob Ford, 2013) I staggered backwards in my residence and hit the medicine cabinet. I began renting this place last week and have been fine so far, but tonight everything went to shit. The medicine cabinet became loose off of the wall and fell on the back of the toilet, shattering the porcelain and having water flow everywhere. The medicine cabinet then fell on top of the toilet and broke it and water and shit flowed everywhere.

I called my land-lord about it and told him it just fell of the wall, it had only one screw in it. He took my word for it and is paying for the damages. I had to clean up the shit and toilet water and dump a bucket of water on the ground to make it believable when he came over to inspect.

bigapes,12,7,1qaalg,16,"Let's start this story out about a year ago. There was a new kid in my grade and we were on a winter sports team together so I made a point to be his friend. He was shy and not very cute... but it was our grade's prom last year so I thought ""hell, I'll ask if he'd want to go as friends, he might not go otherwise"" I clearly stated FRIENDS. My logic: I was long distance dating another boy would wouldn't be able to make it... bro zone. Fool proof right? No. I didn't end up going with anyone because we broke up and I KNEW it would be misleading to the new kid if I went with him. 

Come spring, he'd often come to some of my games asking for rides home, which I'd give him because we lived somewhat close to each other. Whatever. I SHOULD HAVE started to catch on to the fact that he had a crush on me when he asked if we could get food together (for some excuse he created in which I forget... something along the lines of ""my mom is away and I don't know how to cook and you said something about how you like Thai and I've never had it so lets go because I wouldn't know what to order if I went alone"") but of course I'm dumb and I didn't catch on.

Over the summer I probably saw him twice but just in passing... then there was a long gap in talking...
Flash forward to like a week ago: he wants to hang out for Halloween. This is after a few casual ""heys"" in the halls but other than that it was pretty out of the blue. I said sure, because it sounded more like a plea for company because his little sister was going trick-or-treating. Then I backed out last minute because I had a butt ton of studying to do. I expressed how I felt really bad so he suggested we hang out this week. I said sure, because I practically ditched him. 

I kind of forgot I agreed to this, and he texts me Thursday asking if we were still going to hang out. 
I think to myself ""fuck fuck fuck, I don't really have time..."" but I settle with taking him along with plans I already had. I was going to a school sports event today to support my friends, and asked if he wanted to tag along. Blahblahblah yeah, picked him up, went to the event, he asked if I wanted to hang out longer. I FINALLY CAUGHT ON. I noped the fuck out of there and went promptly to the library instead of hanging out longer. 
I want to clarify how I did not (DID NOT) make any cues of interest. I'm a serious person, very school oriented, and make no effort at getting boys to like me. In fact, I try hard to stay away from relationships (especially after the breakup situation mentioned above).

About an hour ago he calls. I contemplate letting it go to voice mail.

But what if something's wrong?

""Hello?""

*nervously* ""You kind of left in a hurry today and I wanted to make sure everything was alright""

Me ""Yeah, everything was fine. Sorry about that.""

""Sooo uhhh I was thinking... and I was wondering if you meant anything by asking if I'd go to prom with you last year?""

Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. No, please not now. We didn't even go!

""Blah blah *no real decisiveness* do you feel the same way?"" 

Me ""No, I'm sorry. I was just trying to be friendly.""

Me ""Sorry. Have a good night""

So my cousin and I are in the process of moving him out of his apartment. We just decided to take a break and take his dog for a ride with us into Newark. She has extreme separation anxiety and has a habit of destroying shit when he leaves, so we thought this would be a nice change of scenery for her.  We sat down in the car and he handed me the key from letting him drive earlier. As he got into the car, he checked for his house key and cigarettes. He had neither. He went back up to the house only to realize that the front door was locked. Fuck. He tries to climb the back fence to his yard to see if he can get in through the back door to no avail. In the meantime, I get out of the car and close the door behind me to see if I can get the front door with the old credit card trick. No luck there either. With this I remember that I have a set of lock picks at my house which we can use to get in. We go to get into the car and... double fuck. The doors are all locked, and the keys are sitting on the front seat next to the pup... I have now spent about 30 minutes on the phone with the roadside assistance automated phone tree to finally have someone sent out to unlock the doors for us in about an hour.

That may not seem bad, but a common side effect of inhalers is nausea, or upset stomach. Usually, you would vomit if you swallowed too much, but since I only swallowed a bit of the spray, instead of... I don't know, drinking the stuff, I just got an extremely upset stomach. So I got back in bed and tried to fall asleep, when all of the sudden, I felt the worst stomach pain in my life, and I knew I was about to have to flood my toilet.

Now, you know how sometimes when you take a huge shit, it feels like all of your body heat goes with it, and you get really cold? Well, since it was 3:00 A.M., I was wearing just a pair of boxers.

Butimnotdoingit,18,12,1q9uxo,18,"A little over a week ago, I threw away my scale because I had become a tad obsessed with my weight. I was tormenting myself, weighing myself multiple times throughout the day, and even keeping a journal of it all. I have only been more tormented since throwing it out. I've been appearing to get bigger and bigger in the mirror, and it's been causing me a lot of anxiety, so last night I decided to pay Publix, my favorite super market, a visit. (They have gigantic analog scales near the exit/entrances)

This morning, I pulled in to Publix, and rushed inside to weigh in. As I walked to the store, I tried to mentally prepare myself, and reassure myself that I was only weighing to know my weight, and that I wouldn't make a big deal out of it if I had gained weight. I started to walk up to he scale and got nervous, so I went ahead and bought a few things I needed while repeating positive self talk in my head.

After checking out I took a few deep breaths and got on the scale. W.T.F. I had gained 2 lbs and I was pissed. My eye balls nearly jumped out the sockets in disbelief. I tried to calm myself, recognizing that I couldn't flip out here in public. I couldn't console myself with *""oh it's just water weight""* because it's ain't my time of the month yet. II couldn't help but feel like I was on he verge of tears when suddenly a wave of relief washed over me. *its my clothes!* 

I had always been nude when I weighed myself at home, and I was dressed for the cold weather, so I started to remove items, starting with my shoes. I was doing this in a rushed manner because I was eager to get the results. Well, I fucked myself big time. 

When I went to remove my hoody, I took off my sweater and shirt with it, bearing my chest. Moreover, somehow in the process my removable bra straps came a loose in the front (thanks a lot Victoria Secret) and the more I tried to remove he top, the more my bra slid down. I didn't actually realize this until my areoles were showing and my nipples hardened from the breeze. To make matters worse, my headphones to my MP3 player had tangled, as I had them under the sweater, making it where I couldn't even pull the tops off my head. 

Once I felt the breeze, I  hurried up and pulled my tops down. Luckily, no one saw as I had gotten there quite early...that is, except for the customer service guy who had a wide grin on his face. After I got my top down, I left out of embarrassment. I did drive to walmart and go to see my weight on one of heir scales in the store, but it didn't make a huge difference. 

I guess I deserved it for being so intense about my weight.

I tried to submit this on my normal account but it kept saying I'm doing that too much even though I haven't submitted a post in weeks.

mcclyte,3,15,1gkwho,0,"Thanks for taking your [time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kGAz6HYM8) reading this.

Have you ever experienced love at first sight?

Have you ever seen a person you've never met before and just instantly gotten the feeling of: ""Man, this is the girl I'm going to marry,"" just by looking at her? That feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you look at her, when you think of her, when you are near her. Even though you do not know that person. That is true love at first sight.

Three and a half years ago I met a girl like that.

They say that people fall in love twice. When you first meet a person you fall in love with their appearance. And when you start to hang out, you fall in love with their personality.

That is what happened.

First I fell in love with her appearance. She had the most mesmerizing, deep blue eyes, ones which I have never seen on any other woman before in my life. Soft face, cute slim nose with a little bulk on it, big lips, and the most charming smile which fit perfectly with her blonde hair. 

We started hanging out, and the more I got to know this girl, the more I realized how perfectly we fit together. She was the female version of me, we cherished the exact same things in life. Sleeping, coke, watching movies, internet, reddit etc. We had the exact same humor and we could talk all night about everything and nothing until we fell asleep because we just didn't have more power left to keep going.

We eventually got together and had the most amazing times together for a long time. I remember when we for the first time tried to say that we loved each other. It came very short, it was a word we didn't want to use too much and not overuse either. We eventually agreed upon telling each other: ""I hate you"" which would have the same meaning as I love you but it was in our humor to say it such as we wouldn't over-use the word love. 

Later things started to get very serious, and I think we took things way too fast for us to handle, from being a college student living at home, we suddenly moved in together. And things started to become a lot more serious. We lived together for one year which was in our contract, and it was the most frustrating, learningful, hard but at the same time incredible year of my life. 

As every relationship has its up and downs, ours had them all, but maybe too many downs. My girlfriend loved me more than anything through these times, but I became cold. I always loved my girlfriend, but I started to change, and I got addicted to playing video games. She always supported me and tried to do everything for me to have the best time, even if it wasn't with her. But I was taken over by a demon of greed. So I quit my job and started playing video games full time. This was the downfall of our relationship. My future wife had to watch me play video games every single day, for nearly half a year. All this while I lived with her, and she payed the rent. What was my thanks for  her doing this to me? Well, my thanks was letting her watch the future husband she loved, transform from being the coolest, most amazing, careful person to a disgusting, filthy, non-caring for anything demon. That was my thanks.

Our relationship has now ended, she couldn't deal with it anymore, and I understand.

Looking back now in hindsight, my demon has been cleansed. I can finally see with eyes unclouded by hate. I've turned my life back to what it was, and I am still continuing, but I am afraid it will be without my future wife. I got my job back, I quit gaming, I've changed, in so many ways, god damn I even started excercising. 

She told me she hated me through the last half year, and she tried to make me change. But it is not until now I fully realize what a complete moron I have been.

She told me she doesn't hate me anymore, and that she has forgiven me for what I have done, but I know she hasn't. 

She says she has no more love to give me, but I know it is because she is giving it to someone else.

She is afraid to give in to me again, because she think I will change back to what I have been before. But I know that if you don't try, you will never know.

She wants to keep the friendship between me and her going, but I know that if I go sleepless one more night because I still love her, our friendship can never last.


I now live my life like Cobb from Inception. Every night in my dreams me and Kristine is still together living happily together. She is my wife, and we have 2 kids and everything is just fine. And when I wake up to reality I lose everything.

So, I glance down and blood is there, not a lot but enough for it to start being something I need to sort the fuck out. I had left the old needle on the pen.Blood spraying, blood dripping. Friend's laughing until they realize this is quite a serious situation. One helps me out of my jumper, we wrap it around the bleeding area, apply a little pressure as if it were a stab wound and then just wait while my other friend notifies the medical center in our University. We take it off after a while, first aid give me some sort of discolored, peachy, plaster and I shove it on and go about my day.

I just got home and took it off. An inch long cut just above my wrist veins but just below the base of my hand, looking much deeper than I first thought.

mybustersword,22,31,1m0rai,64,"Well Reddit, background story- I don't remember the post or what subreddit it was in, but I recall that a male posted an interesting way to masturbate. By clenching your butt muscles like you are pushing out a bar of fudge during orgasm you will prevent ejaculation momentarily and induce a firehouse of cum (preferably into the back of your SO's throat (boyfriend, girlfriend, we all tolerant here)). 

So now that that is all cleared up...My gf recently moved about 250 miles away to complete grad school at a prestigious university for her program. This weekend was her birthday and she was suffering from a bad cold and sore throat so I decided to visit her to cheer her up. I drove all 500 miles total there and back with pretty scenery looking at lots of horses/cows, and we spent some wonderful times bonding with me taking care of her like a knight in shining armor I am. A five hour drive, last minute planned, all for her? She was ecstatic at my get well gifts and bday surprises. Commence to sexy times

uh oh, red tides are flowing. And throat is too sore to give olympic gold medal winning blowjobs (Athens, 2004). So this great handy would do. After some awesome dry humping and hot kissing and her orgasm... whoops. Its fucking Superbad up in the joint and I got a period blood stain on my underoos. Oh well, I brought extra and this is a long term thing, we're cool with that. She proceeds to touch and caress and woman-handle my cock like its [that pottery sex scene in Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW8j818w-qE).

I'm getting ready to blow, and I alert her to the imminent eruption. I remember that technique I read and as soon as I felt that familiar build up I squeezed those butt muscles and... farted in my gf's face. What's worse was I let go of the muscles and started laughing uncontrollably and cumming all over myself while my girlfriend blank-stared at my immaturity level and pulled on my dick with the enthusiasm of a worker on an 8-hr factory shift ... but also was confused at something. Like a dude with toes for thumbs or some shit.

Everything went smoothly at first, gave my shipping and billing info, credit card info, and hit payment. The website said they would send me a confirmation email, which typically goes through immediately when you make purchases online. Ten minutes goes by and no email. Starting to feel worried, I checked back on the website only to see not one, but two charges to my credit card, and one still pending. I panicked, and quickly called my credit card company to have my number blocked and card cancelled. Only one amount had been charged to my credit card, although it was not the amount stated on the website. The lady at the credit card company told me that I still had to pay the one charge and that she would transfer it over to my new card which would arrive in two weeks.

So a few weeks ago, co-worker and I were looking port scanning our network when we noticed that we had a port opened under the name ""LDAP"". So we looked into it and found that is was a protocol for working with distributed directories on a network. Now, we were very curious as to what was using it, so we connected to it with JXplorer, a GUI for LDAP. What we found was shocking: A list of most of the users on the network. I was shocked. I exported it to a text file, and then forgot about it. Two weeks later, I remember that I had the text file, which I needed. When I went to use it, I remembered I had done this on my personal computer, and not the work-issued one. So I did it again, and exported the text file once more.

I was confused. How was this related to me? So I asked them what that was. Turns out that it was something developed by Apple that uses a few features from LDAP.

I attend classical orchestral concerts in a hall of about 2000 - 2500 people.  There are frequently sounds that really take away from the experience, whether they be coughs, sneezes, whispers, dropped programs, etc.  It is extremely frustrating and a properly timed disturbance can ruin the culmination of a piece since even quiet sounds carry so well throughout the hall. 


So, after intermission when I had my 3rd drink of the evening, I was sitting in a tier about 25 feet above the stage during a symphony so that I could only see half the stage and about half the lower level seating.  During the music, I thought I was going insane because I swore I could hear someone down below talking at a normal volume.  I was terribly agitated and kept looking around, but couldn't see the person.  What happened next is extremely rare. 


The conductor actually stopped the music right in the middle of the performance and turned around to face the audience. I could hardly believe it.


I leaned forward to get a better view and there he was!  A man, though now in a somewhat hushed manner, blatantly talking on his cell phone!  I instantly went into a rage, leaned over the rail, and yelled in the large, acoustically-tuned, otherwise silent hall of ~2,300 people, ""GET OFF THE PHONE!!!"" 


I heard over a thousand people shift in their seats to look at me from all directions.  I sat there shaking my head and looking at the people to my left and right in disbelief due to this exceptionally rude man, who had brought the concert to a grinding halt.  I sure put that fucker in his place though.  


Just then, the conductor picked up a microphone and stated that a woman in the audience had gone unconscious and may have had a heart attack or stroke and that a man was on the phone with 911 getting an ambulance to come.  Though intoxicated, I was overcome with extreme embarrassment and slumped down in my seat so far, I almost slid out of it.  I stayed down there for the remainder of the concert.

Phoenix_Fury7,0,3,1q5lin,4,"This just happened tonight. It's sort of a double fuck up.  
So my ex girlfriend has been a complete bitch to me and my friends for the last few days, and today opportunity presented itself. She was visiting my best friend's sister, and when I went to pick him up, I saw her car there. I had to pee. Naturally, I pissed on that bitch's car. Fast forward to the band concert later that night (I'm a senior in high school, by the way), where I'm in the booth in the back working the lights/sound/etc. with my friends.  
Fuck-Up #1: I was describing to my friends, in great detail, what I had done. I get to the good part, which is me standing there going through the motion of pissing on her car, saying things like ""Take that, bitch!"" All of a sudden, my friends abruptly stop laughing. I was confused, until I saw movement out of the corner of my eye. My principal had come up the stairs and into the booth, and had been standing in the shadows throughout the climax of my story. He just kinda smiles, shakes his head, and walks out. My friends all lose their shit. I sit there in horror for a few seconds, then begin to laugh myself.  
Fuck-Up #2: Our musical auditions are this weekend, and we had some down time while the band played their stuff. So we started going over our lines for the acting scene. Then we had the great idea, ""What if we did the scene like we were drunk?"" So we did. And I was the best drunk there. I was in the middle of one of the lines, drunkenly moaning it out (very loudly, to speak over the band) when they finished playing. So, in between the end of the song and the applause a few seconds later, all the back few rows (which included my principal) heard was a drunken yell coming from the sound booth.

emilyeverafter,8,10,1q5iif,16,"  So, this didn't happen today, rather a few days ago. I only realized two days ago that the fuck-up was caused by nude pics. However, I posted this as a comment in an askreddit today and realized that, as a reader of this subreddit, I was doing the TIFU community a disservice if I did NOT post this here as well.  



  To start things off, it's important to mention I have a minor physical handicap and my balance loves to freak out at bad moments. A male companion requested that I provide him with some full-body nudes, and I accepted this with pleasure. I was posing to get an angle of my ass with my webcam on my desk taking pictures when my legs decided that they'd NOPE out of that shot. Because I'm so used to falling, in that short instance where I can tell my legs are giving out, I can predict how my body is going to land and can generally estimate the level of pain, allowing me to have a brief moment to analyze a couple courses of action and choose one.  



  In this instance, I decided the level of pain didn't matter and that it was most important not to make a thud when I hit the ground, which would cause family to run into my bedroom and encounter me naked with my webcam running. I was falling backwards, towards my desk. In the panic, I reached behind me and grabbed unto the ledge with both my hands, pulling so I would swing rather than hit the floor at full force and cause a loud noise. I ended up twisting with the momentum and ended up falling underneath my desk, narrowly avoiding my head, with my arms, somehow in front of me, still gripping the surface, hands palms up. I immediately thought that I had dislocated BOTH my arms. SHIT!  


  I realized, however, that I could still move my arms. Therefore, in my books, I was fine. My arms just felt extremely tender and sore. I finished my duty, and as it was 12:00am, promptly went to bed.  


  I woke up the next day with bruises on my both my biceps in the outer-facing region. I didn't believe that the fall had caused these bruises because I recently started lifting at the gym. I thought I had been pushing myself too hard, but didn't care, and worked out like I usually do. The following day, the bruises were bigger, darker, and had expanded to cover more area. I texted my male friend
&gt;""It's looks as though someone has been beating me with these meager ten pound weights, not as though I've been lifting them.""  


  I thought about how I had sent him nudes and finally, had to face the truth:
I am not only a physical retard, but mentally dense. I'm getting more strange looks at the gym than usual and can guarantee I'll have a bad poker face trying to explain this to my trainer. Please tell me that some variation of ""doesn't matter, had sex"" applies here...  

  &gt;**TL;DR**: I, a literal retard (in the physical sense), fell while taking nude pics to send to a male companion, but the angle of the fall severely injured my arms and made me look like I've been in the weirdest abusive relationship ever.

I snatched his hat off his head and put it on. ""Ha ha! Got your hat!"" I squealed as cutely as I could muster. I tried to run off, but was stopped dead in my tracks.

CLANG!

In my attempts to watch his reaction, I ran right into a bicycle rack. Crotch first. It hurt. A lot.

I dropped like a rock and tried to act casual as I rolled around in the gravel, eyes watering. His hat fell off my head and into the dirt.

Never, even on my worst periods, have I felt such pain down there. A corner nailed me right in the pubic bone. My toes are curling just remembering it.

""Are you okay?""

""YEAH I WAS JUST JOKING!""

I quickly gave the hat back and scampered away, embarrassed, hands over vag. I sat down behind the bathrooms and just sort of curled up until the pain went away. The pain in my cooch, at least.

omgelethrowaway,21,53,1q5c4h,80,"So this happened yesterday, but it is still burned into my mind so I need to share. Yesterday, I had a lot of free time, hours more that I usually do. Usually I would go to school, work out, and go home to do my homework. Two days before, I had just turned 18 so in my horny ""No-Fap November"" mind I thought,""Maybe I will find some hot girl on Omegle that I can masturbate with."" So after 1 hour I finally found this one person who immediately wrote ""f17"" so I was interested (I was 18 for only two days at that point). After talking for a while and I had been exposing myself the whole time, I asked her to turn on her cam. She told me, ""it's okay I'm legit"" and gave me a link to a Facebook account that looking back at it, could have easily been stolen or faked. She said after a few requests she would. She asked me how far I had gone and if I would receive head if I was paid. I said maybe if this was a girl. She asked what if a guy did it, and I said no. I asked her if she was a girl, again she said yes.

Then the requests started, she asked me to dance around ""sexily"" and completely take my pants off. In my overly horny state of mind I was thinking, ""Yeah this is okay, I'm legal after all. Besides, I can see her after!"", so I did. The whole time she was typing, ""oh baby I'm so wet right now"" and ""I want you to put your cock into me"" and saying things about her vagina. This motivated me to keep on doing it. When I finally told her that I've done all of the requests and it was her turn, she left this conversation. I never actually saw ""her"" so the whole time it probably wasn't a girl, alone a ""f17"" one. Now all I can imagine is some perverted old man masturbating to me dancing around naked. I'm not looking for sympathy, I just needed to let this off of my chest. I fucked up, and I was probably being imagined being fucked as well.",TIFU by exposing myself on Omegle.,133

FundRacer,6,3,1q4zh1,25,"Be warned that this story may be too tame for some people's taste but it certainly made me feel stupid.

So I've just finished work. I've been working out in the rain all day and I've promised myself a subway as motivation for getting through the day. So I go to the Subway around the corner from where I need to get a bus. I have twenty minutes before my bus is due (and it's always late).

I want to get a subway to take home to my gf as well and decide not to eat mine until I get home so we can eat together. I also decide to order it as late as possible (sensibly allowing a couple of minutes for potential delays) so that the sandwiches are as hot as possible when I get home. So I order a coffee and a cookie and sit down, enjoying the heat and the shelter for the first few minutes.

When I have ten minutes remaining before my bus iss due, I order the two sandwiches. I ask the guy at the till to take one of them out of the points on my subcard. He doesn't hear me. He asks  me for money for both of them, I ask again (FU), despite knowing I'll lose time while the order was voided and re-entered. I've got 4 minutes to go at this point.

I stand looking at my watch the whole time whilst the guy at the register gets his manager to approve the void and then the card machine decides to stop working just when I try to pay (I can't use cash because I need my change for the bus).

Finally I manage to pay, one minute after the bus is due. I walked outside and I see it coming up the road. I have two choices of bus stop.

- Choice One is the one I'd been planning on, about 70 metres away, around the corner behind. With the rate traffic is going, I can easily get to it before the bus.
- Choice two is on the other side of the crossroads (Subway is on the corner with this bus stop on the corner opposite), the first stop the bus will reach.

It occurs to me that choice one is the safe choice but as I see the bus pulling in to choice two and a few people walking up to it, just large enough group to sufficiently stall the bus, the daredevil in me awakens.

I quickly glance around at the cars and the lights. All visible traffic lights are red and all cars are stopped but I'm sure how long they've been like that. I quickly dart across (FU) and halfway there some of the cars start tooting their horns. I assume a light has turned green, panick and run faster. When I reach the other side, a pedestrian stops me.
'You dropped your bag.', he says.

I glance at the bus. The last member of the queue is getting on. I turn and look behind me. There, about 1 metre into the road on the other side is the bag containing one of the two subs. This is what the honking horns were trying to indicate. I stand watching (FU) in horror as the traffic slowly begin to move. One car turns and its front wheel goes right down the middle of the sub-shaped lump in the bag. There was a loud pop, confirming it's destruction. (FP)

The helpful pedestrian comments behind me 'Ouch... I don't know what it was but....'

Accepting my loss I turn back... to see the bus pulling away. (FP)

Instinctively, I clench... bursting the coffee cup in my right hand. (FP)

Incidentally the sandwich I still have left wasn't mine.

40 minutes later I get on a bus from choice one, having bought and eaten a paid-for sandwich and standing in the rain for 15 minutes waiting.

Fryulator,5,4,1q4pj7,13,"I'm an interesting person in that I'm both a light and heavy sleeper at the same time. What I mean by that is that is quite difficult to wake me unnecessarily, but I am still fully aware of and will react to most interruptions as if I were awake, and will will even wake up fully if I need to. This has lead to some interesting situations, including but not limited to: holding conversations I don't remember, throwing objects at intruders, sending text message replies, and turning off the air compressor outside my room. Sometimes, if my subconscious deems it important enough, I'll even leave myself a mental sticky note, like ""Check your phone"" or ""Your mom wants something."" Today was no different.

  I had been asleep roughly an hour, when my phone buzzes. I remember this because the only calls I get at 8 AM are either collections, or important/emergencies. I see the unknown number and write it off as the former, and just let it go to message and go back to sleep. I woke up properly rested at 10, and realized I had one of those mental sticky notes for myself. ""Check your phone"" it said. I was a little confused by this, as I had no missed calls shown, no new voicemail, and no new text messages. By pure luck, my finger accidentally twitched and pulled up the recent call log. One call answered, today, at 8 AM. This wasn't right. I had let that one go, or so I thought. Oh well, what's done is done, better move on to damage control and see which collections agency will be harassing me this month. On to Google!

  This is where it gets a little interesting, as the unknown number was completely unlisted, and the only information I could find was that it was local (Obvious anyways) and that it was a land line. After a few minutes of intense internal debate, curiosity overcame caution, and I called the number. They answered it on the first ring, and in an energetic, fast voice they say ""Hello this is I'mgoingtospeaktoofastforyoutounderstandwhatI'msaying desk. How may I help you?"" Interesting, this scenario was unexpected. Not wanting to ask her to repeat herself, I kindly explain I had received a call from this number, and then the voice at the other end asked me if I knew anyone who worked there, or if I was applying for work.

  Oh shit. I knew who this was. The words she said at the beginning had untangled, and suddenly it all clicked. This was somewhere I had just sent my resume off to. This was a job I actually wanted. And I'm desperate for work. But mostly, this was a job that I wanted. I told her that yes, I had in fact just recently applied for work there, and she transfers my call to the right department. This time, I get an answering machine. So, I left a message explaining who I was, what my plight was, while omitting a few unimportant details, and end the call.

  Now I am left wondering how badly I fucked up, what, if anything, asleep me said, and if they are still interested in hiring me.

FlashFlip,16,9,1q4lxk,20,"So today was one of those days where I lost the motivation to go to class, and I decided instead to kill some time at the mall. 

I had a dear old time, walking through the mall to get to the bookstore. I walked in, checked out one of Grisham's novels, thinking I would buy it. I decided against it, and wandered around the store some more. I read a couple of chapters of another book, then decided to leave. I figured it was time for lunch. 

I take the escalator up to the mall food court, and turn to my right thinking to myself: ""I'm thinking Arby's."" But little did I know this would seal my fate. As I turn the corner, half asleep, thinking about the books I read, there she stands: a girl I went to high school with, who has MAJOR attachment issues. (To put it into perspective, when her last boyfriend dumped her, she went into a 2 year cycle of depression and trying to get him back. Two whole years of that shit. Which she clung to me to cause apparently I was one of her best friends. So fuck. I thought I was rid of her.) She runs up to me, super excited, and I didn't even motion for a hug. She opens her arms and throws them around me screaming ""OH MY GOD I MISS YOU"". Not wanting any of that I kinda just squeaked out a ""Hey, how are you?"" and as a courtesy (and not wanting to go home quite yet) I decided I'd sit with her through her lunch. 

We got to talking about basic things. School, work, plans for the future, that sort of stuff. I'm on meds that make me drowsy so I kept yawning a lot, and she remarked how I needed to sleep more, and I always responded by saying that's not happening, and how I'm too busy with papers and test to sleep. So we chatted for a few more minutes, and she had to go to work. My car was in the same direction, so I went with. 

We were walking, and things suddenly got so much worse. She puts her arm in mine, and she starts talking about buying matching onesies and how much we'd need to hang out. I immediately said I'm not going to buy a onesie, or ever wear one. That I have a robe for a reason, and that I blatantly refuse to wear such an atrocity. When it came to hanging out, I always responded with a maybe or eventually.  Everyone who knows me know that if I say one of those two words to you it's a solid but more polite no, and everyone knew that in high school. But not her.  I guess I shot myself in the foot with that one, cause she still thinks I'm open to hanging out. She tries to drag me into her store (which is a women's clothing and lingerie store) saying I have to meet everybody. I tell her no, that I got to go and study. So I say goodbye, and I walk off. Not more than 30 seconds later, as I walk into the Discovery Hut, she texts me saying ""Hi! Lol"".

At this point I'm just thinking to myself how much of an idiot I am. I should have just said hi, gotten my food, walked to my car and drove away. Instead, I sat there and talked to this girl who goes bat shit nuts easily. I text one of my friends, explaining what had just happened. She's laughing at me saying: 

""SHE JUMP ON THAT DICK FASTER THAN SONIC IN A SPEED RACE DAMN MY NIGGA. YOU BETTA WATCH OUT FOR THAT ONE HONEY, SHE A FIND WHERE YA LIVE SO FAST, BE OUTSIDE YA WINDOW RIGHT WHEN YOU GET HOME SINGING 80'S POWER BALLADS WITH AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR, JUST STRUMMIN AWAY. BUST THAT DOOR OPEN BAM SHE NAKED ON THE FLOOR WITH SOME ROSE PETALS STREWN ON THE BED N SHIT. SHE GONNA SHIMMY UP THAT DRAIN PIPE OF YOURS TOO MY NIGGA. YOU FEEL? SHE AGILE AS SHIT YOU BETTER RECOGNIZE."" (My friend and mall-girl used to be friends by the way.)

So since then (this happened a couple of hours ago) I've refused to respond to her text, and since I know turning her down will make her go nuts, I'm thinking of going to the bar, and drinking myself into a coma to not deal with.

Let me just **briefly** explain the relationship with this girl.

I knew this girl before college (technical university in my country), but nothing serious. Two months passed since the semester started and it seems that we are good friends. We usually talk about anything. I try to make her laugh all the time, because it makes me happy. I even take showers at her place sometimes. She sometimes just undresses right in front of me, when needs to change her clothes.
She seems to decline every invitation from other boys and usually tells them that she has a boyfriend, while she clearly doesn't. She even told me that she made this shit up, just so they leave her alone.

Well, today she just randomly mentioned that her female roommates left her place, because they went to visit their families. She said this while looking at me, there were other people sitting with us. I acknowledged this fact by nodding, and by smiling a little. I was working away at the table (doing some coding and shit).

Then we both went to our last classes that day. She finished earlier, when I finished she was already at her place.
After I finished, I sent her a text message mentioning the fact that she mentioned at the table. Few texts later, I am literally invited there. I am sure she knew what I meant by that first message.

Here comes the TIFU part. My brain just starts fucking overanalyzing and overthinking the whole situation. I consider lot of pros and cons. Somehow my fucking brain ends up with this logical solution. This TIFU part happens while I'm sitting in front of her place. Just fucking few meters from her house. After sitting there for like 30 minutes, I send her this "";-) some other time"", and leave. She never wrote back. I might see her tomorrow if I want to. Then she leaves for the weekend.

[deleted],11,11,1q3aaq,12,"I have suffered from lazy bowels since a toddler. I have not had a natural bowel movement in years. Once (or twice) a week, I relieve my chronic constipation with an ample amount of stimulant laxatives as nothing else works. Since my stomach was distended, resembling one belonging to a pregnant woman, I decided it was time and went ahead and took my weekly dose and layed down. Usually it takes about 18-24 hours to ""kick in"". During this time, I try to spend as much time as possible sleeping to avoid dealing with the belly ache.

I woke up with sharp pains. I looked at the time on my iPod and estimated that about 12 hours had passed. I could tell i wasn't going to go for awhile, so i tried to go back to sleep instead of wallow in pain. I succeeded. About four hours later I woke up with more pain, followed by gurgling and nausea. I knew by the symptoms I would be due within a hour or so, but I felt fatigued and I couldn't get myself out of bed, and eventually I fell back  asleep. 

I knew I needed to get up, get ready for the day, and go to a place where I could use the restroom, since there is not one where I live. (I live in a storage unit). Well, I truly fucked myself because he next time I woke up a week's worth of food was ready to blow out of my ass, and there wasn't a toilet in site. 

I didn't live far from a couple cafés and a mcds but there was no way i was going to go looking unkempt, the only way I've been able to live here is by not drawing attention to myself, so I couldn't risk it. Plus, I didn't have time tog et ready, so I knew what I had to do. 

I literally had his little triangle of space to use as there's ain't much free space in my unit. I found shopping bags and decided they would be thick enough to use. I figured I'd go for round one, throw away the bag, and go to the cafe to finish defecating. Well, life never goes as planned.

I began shitting nonstop, and it began to overflow. I reached for another bag, slipped, amusing the bag to rip and you can imagine the mess that ensued. I don't know why in the hell I would use the paper bags even if they were seemingly heavy-duty. I guess I deserved it, but I was still foggy minded since I had just woke up.

This actually happened yesterday. I have since been able to clean up the mess entirely and get rid of the odor. I am sure the storage owners are not too happy about the shitty bags, and I am hoping they don't know it's me. I was sure to load up on ziplock bags to prevent this happening again, but I definitely fucked up big time. 

This was a lot longer than I intended. Sorry,

**Edit:** Everyone seems to be more interested in the fact I live in a storage unit than my shitty accident, so I will indulge your curiosity. I cannot go into too many details as I am 1.) Using the library computer which we all know is monitored 2.) could give away my identity if I am overly specific. I will say that I never intended on moving in the unit. It was that I had to suddenly move, and I did not have a place to go. Plus, I didn't want to pay to move in with another roommate when I may have to move again, so the plan was to put my stuff in storage while I slept in a fully furnished room; however, I haven't been able to find a place (or a job). I am a college student, so not much on the resume' yet. I have not been living there very long, but I have to admit that it isn't that bad since I have a bed in there and stuff. I am not a high maintenance person, and i prefer solitude, so it is actually ideal for me. I don't have to worry about neighbors, roommates, etc, but I will probably be moving out as soon as I can. It is (obviously) illegal and I am in no way interested in going to jail. How the hell would I explain that mugshot to my future employers when they google my name.

VE2519,3,4,1q33m4,6,"Ok, not exactly today, but on a Sunday a few weeks ago, and no, it did not involve anyone shitting themselves.

I was hanging out with some friends and my crush. We were all derping about at the 1.5m end of an Olympic sized pool, playing tag, fighting with giant noodles, usual pool stuff. My crush randomly decides to swim to the other side. I thought to myself, ""Hey, maybe I could swim to the other side too. What could go wrong?""

For my entire life I thought I was slightly better than the average swimmer. I was about to be proven wrong the hard way.

I started swimming, moving my arms, paddling my feet and whatnot in what I thought was a rhythm/pattern. But regardless, so far so good. I made it to halfway across the pool when my stamina suddenly decided to drop like an anvil. I thought, ""Maybe I should just pause there a moment. No worries."" 

What I normally do to regain stamina is sink, then rebound at the pool floor in a forward thrusting motion. I do just that. After my whole body went a foot or two downward, I felt a disturbance of some kind. My feet have not yet made contact with the pool floor. I immediately figured that the pool was too deep, and so I doggy-paddled sideways, lunged for a lane divider, grappled it and then hauled myself to the other side of the pool with as much effort as I humanly could.

I grabbed on to the edge and then looked up to see the lifeguard looking down at me. He asked if I was okay, and I responded with ""yeah"". He then asked something like ""do you have any idea how deep the pool is?"" I looked back at him, confused. I then looked at the depth label in front of me. It said ""4m."" I was all like ""...damn."" I then got out of the pool and then examined it. I realized that I have lost all my stamina in the middle of the pool, where it was 5m deep.

Promptly, I went back to the 1.5m end, trying to shake off the fact that I'd almost drowned that day. My friends and my crush had seen everything, and my crush in particular said something like, ""Dammit VE2519, you don't know how to swim properly! I'll make sure to spontaneously give you a swimming lesson whenever we meet here... =)"" She almost never let me live it down from that day on.

My brother was in the main bathroom however, and my mother was in hers. So I had to hold it. And I waited... For what seems like an *eternity*.

TheSicks,11,4,1q2gj9,35,"I actually shaved my nether regions about 3 days ago, but it caught up with me this morning when I was at work. I made the mistake of using a cheap single blade razor to shave the base of my no-no zone and got a really bad regrowth irritation.

It started out as a little itching, but eventually became so irritated that it felt like a a cactus was rapidly growing out of my pubes. I was able to scratch furiously and discreetly, but after a while the pain/itch became so intense, I was scratching every three seconds. It made the last 3 hours of work utterly unbearable. I contemplated euthanasia several times.

I work as a truck driver and I was inside of a refrigerated warehouse unloading an entire truck load of pallets. I managed to duck behind pallets to obscure my scratching, but I'm almost certain that a guy saw me liking down my pants like I had never seen my own penis before. I'm pretty sure everyone there thinks I have an STD or something. I thought maybe that the cold air was irritating me, so I put on lotion. Didn't help. Then I put on gold bond. Nothing! 

It was the worse thing I've felt next to a sprained ankle that swole to the size of an Idaho potato. The itching and scratching gave way to a stinging pain like hundreds of tiny needles poking me in the pubes. 

Eventually, I finished working, got in my 18 Wheeler, and cleaned and reapplied gold bond to the affected area. This time, I felt the cool, fiery burning of mentholated gold bond and immediately regretted my decision. So I cleaned it again, and just grabbed as much ice shavings as I could from the freezer and put them on my raw junk. After three helpings, I was able to get to the nearest store to purchase a bag of ice and wore a plastic baggy filled with ice cubes for the next hour and a half. After a while, everything was so numb, I couldn't feel the pain.

HooksFourHands,1,2,1q2gc0,6,"Today I had an advising appointment to schedule my classes for next semester, and due to more than a few extenuating circumstances, I hadn't really put much thought into it. 

I should explain that my university is fairly small, and in some schools (like mine) the professors are also advisors. I happen to be in this particular professor's class this semester.

So I go in, obviously flustered because I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing, hand over my advising report, and launch into an explanation on why I didn't turn in my bibliography on Monday because I was sick and in a Sudafed coma (though I didn't actually call it that).

Getting on with the actual advising, she looked over my papers and asked me about my plan. I admitted to only having a rough one because I may not be coming back in the spring due to financial reasons. She tried to move on, but some idiocy compelled me to explain my situation (like she cared) and ended in me saying, ""So basically I'm up shit creek without a paddle."" She sat at her desk looking utterly dumbstruck, and after what felt like forever, she asked me if I'd considered counseling. I said I had gone but had stopped for a few reasons, one of them being that my parents had called the on-campus counselor demanding my records, which by policy they could not release. 

""Have you talked to the dean?"" she asked. 
""No,"" I said. ""But I think my parents have called her, or her office, at least. They're trying to withdraw me without my consent.""
""Why?"" she asked.
""Cause they're assholes,"" I replied, instantly wishing I hadn't. 

A long-winded conversation later, she calls the dean of students. Shit. I REALLY need to learn to keep my mouth shut sometimes. 

""I have a student here who has a very....complicated situation,"" she says, and launches into a description of it, down to my asshole parents demanding information from every office on campus and refusing to pay my tuition (when they promised they would). A few minutes after I asked to speak with the dean, she hands the phone to me.

""Hello?"" says the dean. ""Professor ____ tells me you have an interesting situation.""

""It's not so much interesting as it is...."" I'm searching for any term but fucked up. I mean, this is the dean of students I'm talking to. Let's keep it professional here.

In the meantime, she goes on a rant about counseling and confidentiality. I am getting rather fed up with everybody (and it's more than these two) telling me I need counseling. I don't need to prattle on about my feelings, I need to get my ass out of trouble to avoid getting kicked out of the university for not having my tuition paid. 

""Yes, but I'm looking at this more from a logistical standpoint,"" I interrupted. She doesn't seem to hear and goes on about counseling.

I let her talk for a minute or so before I finally lose it and practically scream into the phone, ""I KNOW what I have to do, I just need to figure out HOW to go about doing it!!!!"" My advisor's eyebrows skyrocket into her hairline. I'm usually very quiet. 

A few more seconds of ""blah blah blah counseling,"" and she hangs up. My advisor is getting antsy because she's late for a meeting (and also probably due to the scene which has just unfolded. Thank God the door was closed), and I gather up my stuff, apologize profusely, and bolt out the door. 

I don't know how I'm going to go to class on Monday.

837746227395021,7,7,1q2e6e,35,"I have a dirty little secret: I own a vibrator. I own a 4 inch long, three speed, rotating, vibrating, vibrator, and occasionally when all of my housemates are out, I use my vibrator. I'm sure I'm not the only straight man who owns a vibrator, but I can't say I've ever met another man who owns up to having one.

I also own a pair of hiking boots. When I'm not using my vibrator, I like to do normal people things, such as hiking.

I live in a house with three other people. I hope they don't go in my room when I'm not around, but as a precaution I hide my vibrator. Not in my top drawer with my condoms and my medication and my Magic The Gathering cards, I don't care if they see any of that stuff, I hide my vibrator in my hiking boots which sit at the bottom of my wardrobe.

Today at about 12pm I received a text from my friend - he's going away camping for a couple of days and his boots are wrecked, so he asked me if he could borrow my boots seeing as we are the same shoe size.

I said yes, he could borrow my hiking boots. I told him to come over and pick them up at about 7pm, when I'm back from work, and have had a chance to eat some dinner and remove my vibrator from its hiding place. He said OK.

At about 4pm my friend, being in the area at the time, decided to knock on my door. I wasn't in, but my housemate was. She let my friend in, and kindly helped him look for my boots. They found my boots, and my friend took them and text me to inform me of this.

I met this kid on there who said he was 18, gave his birthday (and he was 18 and 1/2 according to that), and after talking to him for about 3 weeks, decided to meet up with him to fuck.

Now, he doesn't have a license, but in the city, that's not uncommon for most people. So I go pick him up, and since he lives like 30 min from me, I asked him where is a good place to go. He suggests a parking lot.

We get there, we're making out, he's giving me head, then I slip a condom on and I'm balls deep in his ass when 2 cops roll up. They ask for ID's (of course he doesn't have one). I give them mine. He gave them his name, address, phone number, etc, and they look up his info.

****EDIT****: GOOD NEWS! Cop just called. He spoke to the DA and since the kid lied, and I had done all I reasonably could to verify his age (since the kid didn't have an ID), then I had ""reasonable belief"" to believe he was over 18, and so that combined with the fact that he is 17 1/2, so very close to 18 and so even visually it's hard to tell the difference, the DA has decided not to prosecute anything.

noat1inparticular,2,9,1pzvav,0,"Last night i went out with an old school friend to see a band play. I knew a good few ppl there. Including this incredible girl that i have been flirting  and swapping clothing with for some time. We both live busy lives so its always just been put on the back burner. In no rush kina thing.
So the band finishes and we all proceed to get more drunk and continue to socialize. We move from watering hole to watering hole progressively getting more inebriated. 
At one of these holes i held back as there was this chick that i was having a bit of a laugh with. (Side note, sister challenged me about getting this style of chick) I am pretty steaming at this point and really just want to get some ""moisture"". I start making Danger Zone jokes and it worked a little to well. We end up pulling in the middle of the bar.
 No more than 5 seconds had passed when who walks through the door. None other the pretty lady i so want, trying to get me to hurry up. Crying. Like hysterical crying with the sobbing to boot. She runs up to me and just hugs me. I hold her tight and kiss her on the side of the head. I try and ask whats wrong ..... i am drunk and pretty dumb. I gave up on the words and just hugged and said its all going to be all right and asked what she wanted to do.
We walk to the next watering hole. Dropping her in to her friends arms i turn to another one of my friends that was there asking him to make sure she will get safely home. They live close together. I say my good byes to the party and to the special girl i give hug and another kiss on the side of the head. Told everything would be alright and made a bee line for the door. Feeling like a total dick.
Leaving the bar i see the chick that i pulled at the other bar waiting for me. We decide that we should be heading the same directions and that would be her place. We didnt have to wait to long for a bus thankfully and it was pretty empty. Sitting at the back staring in to space my hands start to betray me and before i know i got this chicks tits out and she is sitting on my lap. The guy 5 rows ahead moves to the front of the bus. We continue whilst watching my city go by, having a rather good time with a lot of laughing. Not giving a fuck that there are cameras right above us and ... well, gin an me.

Ihaventfuckedyet,9,10,1pzk2i,18,"Ok some background. Me and my wife met in our mid teens, were our firsts, and knew nothing else. We married because we thought there was no other option. We've been completely dependent on each other since we met, due to some life changing circumstances, and haven't been able to make our marriage work. Needless to say our relationship had grown extremely stale, and sex was nonexistent due to the lack of emotional connection. Me being the typical guy, I was usually able to look past this lack of emotion thing, as my sexual urges overpowered any feelings of resentment towards her, at least long enough for a good fuck, you know? But understandably, it was difficult for her to switch off the conflict surrounding us. And so sex became nonexistent. Anyway, she finally gave me an ultimatum; either I left or she would. And so I left. I moved out. It was really hard , because I didn't know life apart from her. At all. I was/am very lonely. (We've been together approx 15 years).

Hellion102792,16,4,1pz7in,20,"A little background.  I have a 1967 Gibson Skylark, it's a small 5w tube amp.  Last summer I restored it to working order by doing a full filter cap replacement and adding a 3-pronged AC cord, all without killing myself.  Those 3 years of the electronics vo-tech program in high school sure have paid off.  I brought it to the studio recently to record it and during the trip the positive leg of the AC cord came detached inside the amp.

Today I was bored and decided to crack it open and reattach the wire.  I got it open, removed the chassis, re-soldered the cord, plugged it in and tested it.  Success!  Time to close it up.  I slid the chassis back in place and I grabbed one of the 2 little bolts that hold it in place flat on the bottom.  There's not much clearance between the top of the amp and the bottom of the chassis so I put my hand in to screw the left side in (power section is on the left, caps and components are on the right).  

**ZAP!**

God I'm fucking dumb.  I got distracted by my roommate after I tested the amp and my dumb ass forgot to unplug it.  My right hand made contact with one of the wires and the ground and I felt electricity shoot straight up my arm.  I reacted pretty much instantly and got away but man, what a feeling.  I used to get shocked by my other big tube amp because I bought it without a ground pin, but that was more of a gradual awful buzzing feeling in my arms.  This was a straight up zap that made my arm numb for a minute.

After I stepped away I realized how the result could've been worse.  Here I was with my hand inside a plugged-in high voltage tube amp with no shoes or gloves on.  Had I been more careless and made contact with the filter caps and the ground or had both hands on the chassis when I got zapped I could've possibly gotten fucked up.  We don't have a circuit breaker in my apartment so I'm not sure if it would've just turned off.

Lesson learned.  Pay attention if you're going to be working on something that can potentially hurt or kill you.

I pulled my panties off, which had only been down to the beginning of my thigh--just enough to rub my clit and slit--completely off, along with every thing else.

My friend (who is one of my employees) was having just as bad of a time and said she could use a drink. I had a box of wine and some shit to forget so I invited her over after work.

We got to my place about 3:30 and got right to it. We had fun complaining about work and talking about our sex lives. At that moment I got a snapchat from a girl I've been talking to and occasionally fooling around with for a few weeks. I sent her a picture back of me and my friend. Apparently she thought my friend was hot and encouraged me to get with her. I got a little pissed off because this weekend she was supposed to spend the night for the first time but couldn't--and now she was telling me to hook up with my friend.

She was having some problems with a guy she's been sort of seeing too. So we both drank more and more. At some point she mentioned that she had never actually had an orgasm unless she did it herself--and that she had never been with a girl. In my drunk and spiteful state, I bet that I could get her off.

Next thing I know, clothes are off and I was doing my thing downstairs. It was not long before I indeed brought her to climax. And then again. Afterwards, we went back to furiously kissing and scratching and biting. Bless her she even got on top.

This morning I went into work. I tried my best to cover my neck...but I could see the stares. Everyone knew she and I had hung out yesterday and when she came in with a small hickey covered in make up, their suspicions grew. But we denied it and quickly moved on to work.

nike215,32,70,1pwjkk,292,"So on Halloween we had a fake graveyard with funny names/sayings on them like Anna Rexic and etc. It took a little while to set up but it came out pretty nice. The day after Halloween I decided to leave them in my lawn, as I didn't feel like putting them away and it looked nice and I figured why bother. This continued for the past couple of days as I was extraordinarily lazy. Fast forward to today.

My neighbor across the street was a nice older man. He was around 80 years old and had lived in that house for as long as I could remember. He would yell at us for playing street hockey, but only because he was always taking care of his bed-ridden wife of around 50 years, and she was sensitive to sounds. We always respected him and did whatever he needed us to do. He still gave out candy on Halloween, but you could tell he wasn't looking very good as of late.

 If you hadn't figured out already, I have to talk about my neighbor in the past tense, as he died early this morning. It was pretty sad. He fell down and died, pretty gruesomely. He broke his neck and his arm he used to brace his fall ended up being ripped to shreds, as his skin was so weak from his age. A very scarring event.

As I was leaving the house this morning, I felt a pretty strong wind, so I decided to go back inside to get a windbreaker. When I went back outside I began walking to my car, but  I noticed something on my old neighbor's front lawn. Curious, I wondered over. The closer I got to the object the more my heart started to race. I pick it up and I could not believe what I saw. It was one of my tombstones that got blown over to his house by the wind. Not just any tombstone however. The tombstone that ended up on his lawn was that of Humpty Dumpty, with the phrase ""I was pushed!"" I was horrified. I quickly picked up the tombstone and brought it back to my house. Now I believe the reason he left his house was to pick the decoration up off of his lawn, which lead to him falling.

She's also an extremely picky grader.

And, with my dumb ass having a C in her class, I wanted to do really good on this upcoming project due Monday (today). So I broke my back and spent alllll Sunday working on this goddamn powerpoint. Got done with it, and saved it on my handy dandy flashdrive. Of course. I still have to make note cards, because I have to present this monster to the class. Oh well, my night is gone anyway. I made the note cards, and typed the paper she wanted us to do with it as well. I better get a 100 on this shit.

So this morning rolls around, I get ready and I put my flashdrive in my pocket. I go about my routine and think ""The last time I wore khakis AND a sweatshirt, I was sweaty af by the time I walked up to the school"" (I park in a lot down the hill from my school). So I change out my khakis for cargo shorts. 

I go about my day, until 3rd period comes barreling down on me. Why did it come barreling down? Because I was nervous about my presentation, because I have the worst stage fright this side of the Mississippi. Thank god for that perk, amirite?

So anyway, i'm nervous as fuck waiting for my name to be called. I hear a shrieking, terribly broken version of my name break the air. I solemnly walk up to the front, reach into my pocket and-

Grasp at nothing.

Lots of people followed me, which was cool, since many people don't usually follow me back on my personal account.

I got a slight amount of hate, from people who thought the account was stupid, but people generally sent in okay stuff, lots of them about what they thought about certain people.

cak3isyummy,10,9,1puxoz,3,"**Background**: My mother in law is crazy. She has no regard for anyone else. She is completely selfish and is an alcoholic. I know this, so I do everything I can to not provoke her. Everything that happens to her, she complains about to everyone she knows and she lies about everything. Unfortunately, my husband and I live with her while we get back on our feet.

I bring lunch to work with me because while at work I am not allowed to leave the property. Most nights I remember to make a lunch, but sometimes I forget or run out of time. So I have a big box of hot pockets that I keep in the freezer for a last minute grab while I'm out the door. I don't eat them during the day and my husband won't eat them.

**The story**: Last week I house sat for the neighbors. When I came home I find that the box of hot pockets isn't in the freezer anymore and there is a single hot pocket sitting in there. When I left there was at least half a box. At this point I'm frustrated, but happy that I caught it before it was too late. I had time to go to the store to get a new box. I wanted to tell my mother in law (let's call her Alice) that I don't want her eating the hot pockets without asking first, or at the very least replacing them. Most of all though, I want to know that she's eating them so that way I know when to get more for work. So I had to find the least threatening way to convey this to her without her freaking out.

So, the next time I saw her in passing (we have opposite work/sleep schedules) I asked in the most polite way I could, ""Oh Alice, I was curious if you've eaten any of the hot pockets?"" Her response started out proud but then ended in a question, ""Yeah, I had two, or three?"" She stood there for a second and then asked ""Why?""

At this point I knew that I had already messed up but it's already happened so I have to finish this. So I just got really quiet and acted a little bummed and said, ""Well, I just take those to work.""

At this point she gets very defensive and snaps at me saying that she'll go to the store and replace them. I start apologising and thanking her for making the trip. She then leaves and goes to the store while I go into my room and text my husband that I fucked up. She comes back, slams the door and starts stomping through the house yelling at me. ""There cak3isyummy, I paid you back your hot pockets and then one! Now maybe you can pick up your garbage off my floor!""

I stay in my room and just try to not cry. I know that a storm is coming and I just hope that it will blow over soon. I go to my husband's work for dinner and tell him the story of what happened. I then go to work for the night. Well he gets home and within an hour of being there, she calls him out to yell at him about me.

She tells him how great she is (she lets us live here, she lets us pay rent next month because we can't afford it this month, she barley charges us for bills etc.) and then goes into how ungrateful and disrespectful I am, that I ""chewed"" her out and how she's ""this close to-"" (she cuts herself off there and he figures she was going to end that sentence with kicking us [or me] out). She then goes into how it's only a couple of dollars and that I shouldn't get so upset about it. He tells her not to worry because we will move out this month (he started looking for places right before she called him out) and she gets offended and says that we don't have to move and blah blah, you know the courtesy argument you're supposed to make in that scenario. Anyways now we are looking to move out, and we can't really afford it right now. So now we're going to spend our time at my mom's house and his cousin's house, just so we can get away from her. I haven't seen her since they had that conversation, and I'm going to do everything I can to not see her again or as little as possible. This whole situation is so stressful and I don't even know where to go from here.

It was just a casual lazy day of watching football until my long-distance girlfriend sent me a dirty snapchat picture or her in just her underwear. Naturally, I respond in kind, and things escalate from snapchat pictures to snapchat videos. Eventually, I conclude that the exchange would be better suited for face time, so I send her a facetime request. She couldn't answer because she was having internet problems, but being ridiculously horny, I kept sending her invites to facetime. 

After about the 5th attempt, facetime shows that its beginning to connect with her, and I have my camera facing my hand holding my dick, because I'm sure that is what she wants to see. After about 3 seconds of it connecting me to her, I see her dad looking thoroughly disgusted. 

I nearly shit my pants and text her frantically asking what the fuck just happened. She then texts me and notes that her IPhone and IPad (which happens to be at her parents' house) are linked.

jtotjhej17,28,11,1puoyj,26,"Some friends threw a big costume party last night for Halloween. Costumes, scary shit everywhere, the whole shebang. 

I got a little too drunk- drunker than I'd been in a while, and threw morals out the window. Some girl I'd never met, but who is friends with quite a few of the party-goers, was giving me goo goo eyes all night, and kept finding excuses to come talk to me, or be around me. 

I was out back having a smoke with the cool kids, and of course she tagged along. She said she'd never tried a cigarette and took a drag of mine. Didn't like it. Some girl asked what other things she's hadn't done and she said she'd never had sex. 

Cue the 30 minute, drunken, 10 person conversation about sex, virginity, life lessons, all that crap.

So she gets cold and goes back in, I follow to get another beer. It's getting fairly late, about 1:30 in the morning at this point. 

She's totally hammered, last night apparently being the second time she's ever drank.

People were kind of winding down, just having conversations everywhere. She and I started talking in a back hallway that lead to a guest bathroom, and started making out. Locked ourselves in the bathroom, and started feeling each other up.  She says she's not going to have sex, but she figured she was drunk enough to try giving a blowjob. She then proceeded to do just that. Try.

She had a terrible gag reflex, and kept trying too hard to make it really good. Ended with me jacking in front of her face while she kind of fingered herself, and she finished me with her mouth. Half-swallowed, half coughed it all everywhere. We cleaned up, put clothes back on, and rejoined the party. I went out front with my buddy, had a cigarette, and we left for food.

T_shick85,9,3,1pumid,0,"Well for starters, let me explain the situation. I'm a 17 year old highschool student that has been working at Wendy's for around 8 months. I've grown kind of close to my one manager (we have 4) and we kinda serve as each other's sanity because working fast food everyday puts a lot of stress on a person. 

Well anyhow, this manager, we'll call him Jay, has a 2012 Ford Mustang Club of America edition. It has all the bells and whistles from traction control to heads up displays and all that. Real nice. Well Jay often let's me drive his hot ride and sometimes uses it as a bribing tool to get me to come in on my day off and work for him. This was one of those days

Jay sends me a text at 11 in the morning and asks me if I want to work a 12 to 2 for him. I reply back and say that I am already working a 5-1:40 a.m. He then says that if I work 12-2 I can take his Mustang home with me, as long as I fill it up first.  I of course oblige and show up and work my 12-2 and he hands me the keys and his gold American Express and reminds me to fill it up. I was on cloud 9 as I walked out of Wendy's and got into my boss's slick black vehicle. I fill it up as he asked and take it home with me. I quickly call my friend and say ""hey man I got my boss's car wanna go to Dairy Queen?"" He of course does and I pick him up and were on our way. 

A bridge is out along the route to our destination. No big deal I thought as I pulled into a nearby parking lot to turn around when all of the sudden KERPLUNK KERPLUNK!  What the fuck was that? I look behind me and I see a huge rock, about half the size of a cinder block through my rear view mirror. Normally that wouldn't be that big of a deal but this is a Mustang and it does sit very low to the ground. I quickly stop and check out the underside of the car. Nothing is dripping or broken so I got back in continued the journey to Dairy Queen with my friend. En route, I had noticed it wasn't running right. It seemed to have a hard time catching second gear. I called Jay when I arrived at Dairy Queen and he said that sometimes it is slow to accelerate after getting gas. I thought okay whatever and enjoyed my Dairy Queen. We returned to the car and when I turned the engine over, it didn't start. I tried again and again and it never started. I called Jay and could tell that he was flustered but tried his best to hide it and still reminded me I has to be at work for 5. I had a friend pick us up as I had to leave the Mustang in the DQ parking lot and showed up to work. Meanwhile Jays dad got the car to start and carefully drove it to the Ford dealership. They are closed Sunday and we are waiting to hear what the problem is on Monday. Jay said he would never make me pay for the damage, which there's no way I would have money for anyhow but I feel awful about not paying. Also my parents do not know I did this, which is a good thing because they would castrate me if they did.

I slipped it in to section 3 because, well, that was the next section and I was just kind of on autopilot because I was stressed about doing my best. 

We get back from break and the proctor instructs us to open up our answer packets and, if you haven't taken the SAT, there's a part where you need to write in script about how 'this is your work and no one elses'. So, I flip open to the answer packet and I'm doing my best to remember how to do cursive. As I'm writing, the proctor says in a stern voice ""EXCUSE ME, is your test book open?"" I realize she's talking to me. I apologize profusely, trying to explain myself, but she's having none of it. I close the test booklet and tell myself to get my act together and pay attention. 

I was shaking from her yelling out to me. I simply was under so much stress that I was having a hard time processing it. Trying to calm myself down and finish with the cursive, I heard the proctor say 'section 3'. I assumed we were starting section 3, so in my autopilot mode I flip it open again. The proctor lost it, wondering 'how stupid' I could be. I was honestly wondering the same thing, too. There was another kid who didn't understand as well, and she both reported us to her supervisor. The supervisor informed us that our scores would most likely be canceled because we could've been cheating. 

I finished section 3, excused myself, and canceled my scores. I signed myself up for the December one, but if I mess up on that one then I can't go to college. So basically because I was so nervous, stressed out, and auto pilot about doing well, I did the exact opposite.

Before we had even gotten to the game store earlier, her gas light must have come on, but we didn't notice it. We were both busy talking, you know how it is. Anyway, on the way home we sure noticed it. To make matters worse we were laughing a lot so she was now at emergency level. The McChicken's were not being nice to her.

We are driving on the freeway and she ran out of gas. Obviously this was not good, we started panicking, her for more than one reason. Where we had stopped there was a guard rail where there were railroad tracks that ran under the freeway. You know, the cement ones that are like 3 feet tall.

At this point there was no holding it for her. She was in a pretty bad state and had the brilliant idea to drop trou right there and hang her ass over the guard rail and "" release the kracken"" as she would later put it.

To make matters worse again, sitting on the guard rail was apparently difficult for her to balance. Guess who had to hold her hands so she wouldn't fall. So, there we are, her pooping over the rail, both crying, her apologizing, all happening on the side of the freeway in the dark. Luckily her car had some paper towels in the back.

My head tilts back and forth like I'm going to lose my consciousness and on the 3rd forward tilt all the non-digested and not-very-well chewed lunch and the product of my munchies comes out of my mouth in 3 very long and strong streams. 

In the background I can still hear Tame Impala, at least my fav music is on while I'm vomiting:)

I go back to the livingroom where my girlfriend, the friend, and her boyfriend awaits me. I look like shit and tell them what just happened, ask the friend where the switch is so I can take a look at the damage. 

FML, the sink is clogged like hell. Like really really clogged from all the food deep down cause there was nothing to protect bigger things to go down. Mind you there is no plunger either. I spend my next hour spooning out my vomit from the deep hole with my index and middle finger and throwing it into a bucket. With every removal some comes up so I figure in time it'd unclog. Nope, after a time nothing comes up. I need to apply some pressure down there, so I take off the showerhead, plug the pipe in the sinkhole and send some water down there with full pressure. Fuck yeah!!! Even more stuff coming up. But there's more and more water.

Spoon out the vomit with my fingers, throw it into a bucket, then remove the water with a smaller bucket into the big one so the sink doesn't overflow, then plug the shower in and full pressure. Rinse and repeat 20 times. Still clogged, and after a while nothing comes up from the hole.

Note that while this is all happening I'm still pretty fkin high.

Then comes the enlightment - I'm a fkin engineering student, I need to use my fucking brain!!! I need to make a plunger of some sort myself! I grab a cleaning cloth, stuff it into the hole so that I make some kind of a vacuum in there and start pumping the cloth. 

I hear something. It's the sound of my freedom from this bathroom! I make an orgasmic gasp. It's over. It's time to smoke some more and enjoy myself.

Since they passed out already somehow, I put her to sleep on the couch downstairs. I'm not tired, so lay down and browse the webs for 30 mins till I hear a noise upstairs in the kitchen.

I met this very hot guy (nb. I'm also a guy) at the club. A gorgeous 6"" Australian flight attendant.  We really got along well - too well, perhaps.  I didn't realise the time until he checked his watch and said it was 3.40am.

We decide to go back to the hotel that his employer had rented for him - a really nice place in the centre of town.  Sexy times ensue.

It's a classy hotel, too. Great views of the river; linen that you're tempted to steel. 

We're sleeping it off and... I have this incredibly vivid dream that I need to pee terribly. In my dream I am trying so hard to find the bathroom.

And then I woke up.

Completely naked, in the hotel hallway.  My dream was correct - I definitely was in dire need of the bathroom.  Unfortunately, I could not remember for the life of me which hotel room I had stumbled out of.

Incredibly confused, freaking out, and naked, I go from door to door trying all the handles hoping that the relevant room is unlocked.

After trying about 15 rooms, finally! Success! The door opens!

Except... it's the wrong room.  I make eye contact with a business man doing up his tie - my head poking around the door he was not aware of my predicament - and mutter a ""sorrywrongroom"" apology.

I retire to the garbage shoot to evaluate the situation.  What am I supposed to do?

Finally, I hear another door open.  I decide there's nothing for it.  Hand-on-crotch, I step out and say, ""Excuse me.""  I explain my predicament and they provide me with a towel and telephone reception.

The receptionist was an absolute doll. I tell her, ""This was a total one night stand.  I have no idea what his name was.  All I know is that he works for an airline and his hotel booking is for several weeks.""

This was enough to narrow it down to two rooms on that level (hoping I hadn't managed the lift while asleep).

We try the first option and - success - I see my pants in the corner.  I signal to the receptionist *we did it* and she gives me the thumbs up.

She leans over and whispers in my ear, ""His name's Dean"" before closing the door.

I peed, slipped back into bed and never mentioned a word of my fuck up to my host.

EDIT FOR EXTRA DETAIL: I relieved myself down the hotel garbage shoot. I lied when I said I did it after I was allowed entry into the hotel room because I was actually too embarrassed to admit it to reddit.

After ~~a few~~ many shots of tequila, I decided that I would try my hand at making some kind of tequila cocktail. I mixed tequila with some grapefruit Perrier and decided that to top it off, I was going to break open a habanero pepper I had laying around and drop it in because I like spicy food, and apparently tequila isn't already harsh enough to drink.

So I drop this pepper in my drink and immediately notice that something is wrong. Everyone around me is coughing and sneezing and I quickly realized that instead of creating a awesome spicy tequila cocktail like I planned, I have created a chemical weapon in my kitchen.

After a few seconds of me going OHSHITOHSHITOHSHIT, my drunken brain decided that the best way to dispose of this bubbling shitstorm is to drink it. So I bring the glass to my mouth and immediately inhale the concentrated habanero vapor causing me to cough and spew my drink all over the sink, further worsening the situation. By now pretty much everyone on the main floor of the house is coughing and wondering what the fuck is going on, so I ditch the drink down the drain and retreat upstairs to my room as fast as a plastered man in tights and fuzzy pink slippers can (I was dressed up as Mermaid Man).

Today I thought it would be a great idea to drink a pitcher of margarita in one sitting while I was at a restaurant that my friends and I frequent.  It's kind of a ""rite of passage"" because it has high alcohol content and it's frozen like a slushie so you have to deal with brain freeze.  I thought I was going to be a big dog today and take it down.  The good news is, mission accomplished.  The bad news is later on.

At this point is when my memory is starting to become shaky.  We get to the bar and my friend order us all double shots of tequila.  No big deal.  I order all of us another double shot of tequila.  No big deal.  I am only highly drunk at this point in time.  This is when I should stop.

I did not stop.  I enjoy black russians (vodka+kahlua) but the bar didn't have them regular so I told them how to make it and they charged me for 2 shots of both vodka and kahlua.  My drink was 18 dollars a piece and I didn't realize it.  I ordered another and started buying shots for the girl sitting next to me.  

At this point I am blacked out.  My friends filled me in here.

I go in the bathroom to throw up.

There is shit everywhere.  On the toilet seat.  In the bathtub.  On the bathtub.  Outside of the bathtub.  On the floor.

I cleaned it up.  I knew it was me.  No questions asked. 

I walked into the living room and find my wallet with a receipt sitting on top of it on the coffee table.  I'm thinking ""At least I didn't spend 150 dollars at the bar.""

I barely remember this part but I'm pretty sure I got up and went to try to throw up in the bathroom. I don't think I managed that though and just dry heaved more. 


Everyone else at the party seems completely fine. Maybe a bit high, but no where near the level I was.  I end up back on the couch and by this point I know I'm so fucked up that there's no way I'll get through the rest of the night and I just need to leave.

I awkwardly explain to the host that I am so fucked up after only on hit and only arriving to pre-game like an hour prior that I need to leave and my friend picks me up and brings me home soon after. Obviously I never make it to the actual party.

Okay, maybe I shouldn't have yelled that she was a stupid bitch, but it was my fault for continuously telling her that I'd put her in the back room to avoid customers, it turns out that she doesn't think when she's under pressure, so I'm currently teaching her how to lie to get a job.

In my overwhelming excitement, I forget to lock the bathroom door. Not that it mattered, no one was home . . .

I'm enjoying the jet setting and I'm about to orgasm when I hear, ""Laura, I forgot to ask if you wanna . . .  **OH DEAR!!**"" My Mom had double-backed to ask if I wanted to join her manicure session, but instead she walked in on me holding the shower head to my clit.

She screams and turns around awkwardly while I panic; instead of turning the shower off, I turn it to the hottest setting there is.

**""MY FUCKING VAGINA!!!""** echoes from the shower, down the hall, around the corner and into my mother's already damaged head.

So, here I am, holding a freezing cold wash cloth on my clit while dying from embarrassment waiting for my mother to get home from her manicure. 

TL/DR: Masturbating with shower head, Mom walks in, I turn the knob to hot instead of off and burn my vagina.

**UPDATE**: I didn't get a chance to talk to my Mom until this afternoon. I decided to be mature and ""confront"" her about what she saw. I basically started with ""I'm sorry you had to see that but hey, shit happens"". My Mom laughed and said ""don't worry about it, let's just forget it"". I am back at my Grad-school house, so hopefully with a little distance, my mother will not be consistently reminded of this ordeal via my presence. ",TIFU by masturbating in my parent's bathroom,1754
HalloweenFuckUp,17,23,1pr3cm,20,"**This is a REAL long story, so bear with me. Names have been changed. This all happened 2 nights ago on Halloween.**

Like many other college students around the country, I dressed up and went to this Halloween party that my college was throwing. It was fun and all seeing my friends in their costumes and stuff, but it was *super* boring there cause, you know, it was being thrown by the school. Me and four of my friends decide to ditch it and go to another party. One of the girls with us, Suzy, was obviously into me, making a point to sit next to me while we waited for the others, laughing at my dumb jokes, all that. I'm feeling pretty good about myself. So me and 12 other people (along with my 4 friends) piled into the bed of a pickup truck (the driver was also going to the party) and take to the roads.

That was **Fuck-Up #1**. 

I didn't know it at the time, but driver had already been drinking. So he was going at least 50 miles an hour down these roads, and several times the bed of the truck scraped against the road cause the 12 of us were weighing it down. At one point he took a turn way too fast, and the truck almost tipped over. Eventually we got to the party house and I'm thanking God Almighty for letting me get there alive. 

Here we are at the house (which I had never been to) and it's pretty packed. You had to be pushy just get through the front door, let alone the kitchen where the drinks were being served. So me and Suzy walked in after the rest of the group and grabbed a drink, and we're all just talking right now. Pretty soon I'm dancing with her and having a good time.

I'm gonna pause the story for a second. Suzy wasn't really a friend - more like an acquaintance. My other friends that I know well know Suzy, but I've only hung out with her twice before (with a bunch of other people). So because of this, I'm completely unaware of the fact that Suzy loves to get *absolutely wasted*.

Back to the story. Suzy and I are dancing and having a great time. She's got real close to me and stuff, and she reached behind to put her hands on my chest and waist. Then she wrapped her arms around my neck, and I just kissed her on the cheek. I knew I did something right cause she looks up at me and has this ear to ear grin on her face. So for the next 20 minutes or so we alternated between making out and dancing. She left for a bit at one point, and I just assume she's going to see other friends of hers. I stay where I am and talk with my other friends, too. Suzy came back, and we return to making out and dancing.

At this point I've only had one drink, since I don't really like alcohol that much, but whatever, I'll have one just to have one. Unbeknownst to me, Suzy was not speaking with friends when she left. She was getting more and more drunk.

Eventually we got a warning that the cops are about to show up, so me and my 3 other friends decided to head out and go back to the dorms. Suzy takes me by the hand and we got outta there. But the moment she crosses the threshold from inside the house to outside she falls forward, running into another girl and nearly falling over.

So now it hits me that for the last 40 minutes I've been making out with a severely drunk girl while I've been totally sober. That was **Fuck-Up #2**.

I stood there in shock for a second. How was Suzy *this* drunk? Her speech wasn't slurred when we were talking in the house, she wasn't tipping over when we were dancing, nothing. I was amazed at how sober she had seemed while inside the house. So I was freaking out just a little. To anyone else, it looks like I was taking advantage of her.

Before we started walking to the dorms, I did a sobriety check. I've only had my one drink, so I'm good. The other girl with us, Avanti, was pretty sober, too. The two other guys (let's call them Jake and Randy) were kind of on the threshold of drunk, but still sober enough to walk and form somewhat coherent sentences. Suzy wasn't able to do either of those things.

**Fuck-Up #3** was not thinking to call one of my other friends who wasn't at the party to come pick us up.

Since we didn't have a ride back to the dorms we had to walk there, which was a task much easier said than done. Randy and I were holding up Suzy by the arms, and Jake was just walking behind up being weird. And in the spirit of my terrible luck that night, we ended up taking the long way back, cause Randy couldn't quite remember each turn and I was too busy trying to keep this girl from falling into the road.

So we hoofed it. Several times Suzy decides to just lay down on the sidewalk and yell ""Carry me!"". People driving past eyeball us like crazy. One car actually pulled up to the curb and asked if we were okay and needed a ride. We politely declined because stranger danger, but I was seriously considering it at some points. Whenever we get to a streetlight or road sign I had to forcibly pull her away from the obstacle because she wanted to run into it. 

Now, just take a second and imagine how sketchy this all would look: three guys in ridiculous costumes walking around the streets of the city, holding a drunk girl who could barely stand up or talk. I'm surprised we weren't stopped by the two cop cars that drove past us during our trip. Did I mention we're all underage, too?

But that wasn't the bad part. Nope. The bad part is, during all the stumbling and drunken talk, Jake mentions something about Suzy's boyfriend. 

This was **Fuck-Up #4**, and it showed up in glorious fashion.

I was really, really pissed at Jake now. He had ample time to mention that little tidbit to me, before we got to the party and during the party. A couple other people we knew did as well, but they didn't say anything either. So I was pretty pissed at them, and then also at myself for not asking Suzy in the first place.

Suzy drunkenly protests, however, saying that ""No, no, he told me I could go fuck whoever I wanted. Fuck him. I can show you texts."" She handed me her phone to look at the text message conversation that supposedly cleared her of having an SO. Nothing in those message suggested that she had broken up with him.

So now I'm feeling pretty bad. After all, I just spent the last hour and a half dancing with this chick and making out with her, and it turns out she has a boyfriend. Just great. 

After nearly 20 minutes of walking, we were within sight of the dorms. Almost home free, but there's still a ways to go. I'm convinced that my left arm is going to be jacked the next day from holding this dead weight girl up. Suzy wasn't on the chubby side or anything, but she kept on falling down and dragging her feet. God apparently decided to cut me a break right then, because a car pulled up and in it are more of my friends we all know. They had been having a late night snack down at this food court area and saw us on the street.

They did a U turn and pulled up next to us on the curb. Suzy and I got in the rear passenger seats, while drunken Randy popped open the trunk and hops in, even though he could've fit just fine next to me. Jake also decided there's no more room and just smiles at us, saying that he'll walk the rest of the way himself. I wasn't worried about him at all, so we say whatever and haul ass out of there.

We drove up to the dorms and showed our IDs to the security guard (thankfully Suzy actually shut up for 5 seconds while we did this), and then pulled around to the rear entrances into the building so we could avoid the lobby area. I hopped out and helped Suzy get out of the car without bashing her head in on the asphalt or another vehicle, while my other two friends (let's call them Frankie and Tyler) walk around to the lobby. Randy and I help Suzy up to her dorm room.

So we made it. We finally get to this girl's room. She's been talking about her ungodly desire to pee for the last 30 minutes, so we guide her towards the bathroom, sit her down on the toilet, and stand outside while she does her stuff. Randy says that he's gotta go get his stuff from Frankie's car, and I was stupid enough to let him go and leave me alone with Suzy, too busy thinking about how crappy the night had been. That, of course, was **Fuck-Up #5**, but thankfully nothing came of it. 

I heard the toilet flush and I waited a few seconds before knocking on the bathroom door. Suddenly there was an incredibly noisy *crash*, followed by a bunch of *tinks* and *thumps*. I opened the door and Suzy's sitting in the bathtub with shampoo containers and shower shelves lying around her - she had stood up from the toilet and fallen over immediately. I helped her up and walked her to her bed, and all the while she's giggling like crazy. She invites me to the bed a few times (""Nothing sexual,” she slurs, “Just platonic"") but I refuse.

Eventually Randy comes back with Frankie, Tyler, and a couple others who agree to stay and make sure Suzy doesn't kill herself by accident. Glad to get a load off, I go to McDonald's with Frankie and Tyler to get some food and clear my head of this shitty, shitty night.

**SUPER TL;DR:** I went to a party, made out with a girl, found out she has a boyfriend, walked her drunk ass home, felt real shitty about it and eventually scored a Double Cheeseburger at Mickey D's.",TIFU in so many ways I can't fit them all in the title.,43

TruckerTimmah,6,7,1pq6r1,23,"Decided to take a quick nap after work today as I was exhausted.

I had the most convincing, vivid dream I have ever had. 

I was at a Walmart on Black Friday. I REALLY wanted this new Vortex Virtual Reality game console, and Walmart only sold them on Fridays. There were mobs of people in the store, fighting over things, trampling employees, someone had a horse in one of the isles and was strangling it with a rubberband.

Anyway, I get in line for the console, and while I am checking out a large crowd of 200 people line up behind me. I suddenly feel the overpowering urge to LET 'ER RIP and let out the loudest, longest fart. Flames shot out of my rectum and incinerated all 200 people behind me in line. I finished checking out and left the store, hundreds of people all staring at me with mouth agape.

I get in my car, thinking that I just killed 200 people I might want to get out of town. Decide to go to Mexico. About halfway there I am stopped by a cop, and at least 5 other cop cars instantly show up and surround me. 

A large cop gets out of the car on my left and says ""Do you know why you have been pulled over?"" I played dumb and replied ""No, I don't"" 

""Did you know you killed 200 people back there?"" 

I immediately started the engine of my 67HP N/A Diesel and ran from the police. Somehow I managed to lose a fleet of cops. 

I ended up at my job for some unfathomable reason, and decide since I am already here I am going to get some work done. I go and sit down at my desk and answer a few calls, then I go to the bathroom to take a dump. 

While I am sitting on the throne, *BANG BANG BANG BANG* ""OPEN UP ITS THE POLICE WE KNOW YOUR IN THERE - COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP""

When I finished I went with my family to go to a festival for a few hours. When I got back home I noticed there was light coming from my room, but I didn't remember leaving any lights on. That's when I realized I had left my candle burning, and it was now all melted. I blew out the candle and flicked water on it for good measure.

TGDE,9,6,1ppwg1,26,"So in the Turkish republic foreigners residing in the country for an extended period of time are required to get a residence permit.  Today was my appointment.  This occurs at the Fatih police station.

A lot of people have trouble finding finding the location within the complex where you turn in your papers.  In light of this, after I turn mine in I thought to myself, ""Wouldn't it be useful to create a guide so other people could use it.""  Why this guide should include some photos! 

So stupid me decides to act on this, at the time, brilliant idea and on my way out Im merrily taking photos of landmarks to use.  Since my appointment is late, (9PM) there is nobody around and I can take these photos unabated.  All is well until I get to the front and I take a photo of the building.  I get accosted by what I assume to be a non uniformed police officer and I tell him in Turkish that I don't speak enough to understand him.  He takes me to a uniformed officer sporting an MP5 submachine gun and tells him the situation in Turkish.  By now I realized I've made a mistake but I have no choice but to ride this rollercoaster until the end.

So since I realize my mistake and I already know what's coming next I hand the officer my device with the photos pulled up and I delete one making sure to show him the process.  He takes it and repeats the process for every photo while asking questions like, 

Where are you from?
Why are you taking photos?
Why are you in Turkey?
Where do you Study?
What do you study?

By this point I'm attracting a lot of attention from the other officers posted in front because there is literally nothing else happening other than cars driving by, it's really late like 9:45PM local time.  So every time another officer joins our new circle of friends I have to repeat my story.  By the end I'm encircled by 6 police officers armed with an assortment of automatic weapons including MP5 and M4 looking weapons that may have been HKs since they already had MP5s.  

The last officer that joined our circle of friendship came up on my left and cut me off mid sentence and yelled,""DONT PANIC, DONT PANIC MY FRIEND.""  Now, I dont feel like I was panicking, I could feel some adrenaline sure but even if I was panicking I feel like I was perfectly within my right to panic because I was encircled by police in a foreign country sporting automatic weapons after doing something very stupid.  

Right before this the original english speaking officer asked if I took videos, I hadnt but he had to check anyway.  He watches a few of them, and scrolls through some like he had before with the pictures, at some point he was just admiring my collection, anyway he selects one more to play and this one happened to be me shooting a handgun at an indoor firing range.  So that didn't look good.

Anyway, since the new guy joined I had to go through the gauntlet of questions again and this time at the end, kind of out of the blue, he asks if I know of [Kevin Mitnick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick).  Now, I did two internships at a defense contractor during high school after I performed well in a cyber security competition and at a time I trained to be a penetration tester.  So yeah, I know who Kevin Mitnick is we hit it off from there.  I had the fortune to take a cybersecurity centric tour of the Pentagon before and I happen to have a CIO.gov folder from that day that I used to carry all my residence permit shit.  It has a presidential seal on it and binary 1s and 0s aesthetically faded on the interior, they ooo'ed and aaahh'ed at it for a few moments and made polite conversation about hacking and firearms.  When I'm about to leave he says something about a photo and Facebook, I didn't ask to clarify because I really wanted to get out of that situation since my fight or flight response was still active.  We exchange goodbyes in Turkish after a few steps I say turn and say the equivalent of ""bye-bye"" in Turkish and wave.  They respond the same as a group with a smile and I ran to cross the street.

So I was in my basement waiting for my buddy to come over and operate the camera for my film I'm working on. As I wait I decide to drink straight vodka to kill the time. As I finish 4-5 shots worth, I text another friend, ""Vodka is disgusting.""

I have a history of suicidal thoughts and depression, and she hates when I drink, especially when I'm alone. My film focuses on suicide and depression, and I hold a gun to my head in it. She knows I succumb to suicidal thoughts, I've told her about them. When she gets the text, she tries calling me twice but I ignored them. Third call, I answer but all I say is ""no"" and hang up.

I put my phone on silent and resume filming, because I need to get this done. Two hours later, I check Twitter to see what's new, and to tell my few dozen followers of my finished project. I see that my friend tried contacting my instructor and was tweeting about me without using my name, asking for me to call her. I decide to text her before I go to bed.

Suddenly, all the feels. She tells me how she was scared for me, thinking I was going to do something stupid, maybe take my life. The project comes from my heart and is very reflective of my innermost thoughts. She goes on, telling me how she worries about me every day, and that I scare her with what I talk about (read: suicidal thoughts) every day, and that it eats at her inside.

Most of the night was lame, couples out together, people not in costume, not many people out in general because it's a thursday, etc, etc.

So, I end up getting good and drunk because I feel like a random hookup is not happening, and I eventually break off from my group of friends.  The bar I'm at is closing up so I walk over to another bar next to the one I'm at to roll the dice.  I smoke a cigarette and everyone is paired off with someone or in a group of dudes 5 deep.  I see a hot girl standing by herself.  I start talking to her and she sort of recognizes my costume.  She immediately jumps to me taking her home.  I agree and we hop in a cab back to my place. 

She says she's cold and starts rubbing my legs.  I just take this as her being assertive about what she wants and not leaving anything to the imagination.  She says some other stuff that I don't really hear, but I pay no mind because I assume she's giving instructions to the cab driver.

Eventually we get back to my place and she says we can do everything if I want, which seems weird to me, so I say we'll see, trying to play it cool.  At this point I'm properly drunk and was content with just going to bed with an attractive girl next to me. I escort her in, and as I bring her into my room she basically explains that she's a prostitute.  So much for me being charming or attractive or witty or whatever the fuck I was thinking I was.

It doesn't end there though.  I call a cab for her to get out of there, the first cab comes and calls, but I miss the call due to shitty reception in my apartment.  The whole time she's freezing while lying in my bed, in my not terribly cold apartment so I semi-cuddle with her, which she's cool with.  Eventually the second cab comes and I escort her out, pay for the cab and she leaves.  The whole time she was here I felt awful for wasting her time during prime bar time.  I felt like the biggest idiot, but she was super nice during the whole ordeal.

My wife and brother-in-law were prepping the house for the Halloween party we had planned, and I was tasked with making the sweet tea. Nothing to difficult, as I'm the designated sweet tea brewer most of the time. I set about making the tea, and my wife tells me to use the glass dispensers we had been gifted for our wedding. 

This is where I made a series of stupid mistakes.

The tea reached boiling point, so I took it off the stove and set it aside to steep for a few minutes. I left the kitchen to go to the bathroom, came back and forgot to pour ice in the dispenser. I also forgot that one of the two dispensers had a fine crack toward the bottom, near the nozzle. 

I poured the hot tea into the cracked dispenser, and heard a resounding CRACK! Thinking I had bounced the pot off the rim, I stopped to check things out. Deciding all was well, I filled the remainder of the dispenser with water and finally noticed a small puddle of tea forming around the bottom of the dispenser.

Realizing what had happened, I lifted the dispenser to move it into the sink and was soaked from the waist down in hot tea, flooding the counter, stove and floor in the process. The hairline crack near the nozzle had spread all the way around the bottom of the dispenser, so when I tried to move it, the bottom stayed put while the rest of the glass came free in my hands.

Yesterday I was told that I may have been too harsh on some of my grading, as most graders still give above a 50 if the program is non-functional but compiles (ie: half credit is just giving something that compiles), I had been handing out scores that were ... less than that for programs that did not function or did not follow the directions (or produce any output I could grade).

For some odd reason, my Prime orders get fucked up a lot. (I got a $60 mouse instead of a $10 textbook one time. Not complaining.) But never has it been of this caliber.

I went to the office to get my saber, because UPS said it arrived. Well, I go to get it and they tell me I can't have it because the box says ""Sword"" on it. I try to explain that a fencing saber isn't really a sword, but a dull, blunt thing that is only used with protective padding, not to mention we have a fencing class and team here. It's no worse than martial arts equipment.

They still insist it's a weapon, because the box says sword. So they go and get it and show me the box, which has a drawing of something like this on it: http://www.knife-depot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/long-sword2.jpg and it says it's some sort of sword. I'm panicking at this point because holy shit, Amazon just sent me an actual weapon. You know, something that isn't allowed and could get me kicked out.

So I spend the next 30 minutes explaining that no, I did *not* order a sword, but a fencing saber. The order slip with it listed some sort of sword, not the saber. By this point, I'm probably looking suspicious because I am panicking so much. I go back and look at my Amazon purchase history. It says the saber was delivered. Apparently, the company also sells decorative swords, so the thing I got but I never actually saw except for the picture on the box was a blunt thing you hang on a wall, but I'm not going to try to explain this...because I don't want it. After 30 minutes of talking to an Amazon representative, they e-mail me a label with the item that I actually got and told me just to return it as a misordered item. Okay. They want me to take it back to UPS myself, but the office won't give me the box, obviously. So then I have to work out a pick-up thing there, which cost me money. I'm losing money over this fuck up.

I'm quite sure the people at the desk think I am suspicious, but whatever. I'm glad I caught it early before they had some sort of person come and inspect the package or whatever. The guy at the office said they had set it aside because of the packaging.

I have a friend who recently broke his leg playing baseball (a rather valiant way to break a leg, if you ask him) and I help him get around when I'm with him. We were taking an SAT prep course, so I help him get situated and wait with him for other kids or a teacher to come. I can't remember why, but I walked away from the table at one point. 
As I walked back to the table, I see his backpack sitting on the table. ""Go take his backpack, he can't chase you!"" Good idea, right? Like I said earlier, I saw my opportunity, and I took it. I ran to the table where he was sitting, jumped on the table, and reached for it. As a glass half full guy, I would like to mention that I got the backpack. 
That being said, I knew I had to get out of his range. I started to slide off the table, and only one of my feet hit the ground. The other foot missed, cause my leg to bend in such a way that my knee dislocated. As I hit the ground after hearing the ""SNAP"" that dislocating your knee makes, I remember two things.
1. Seeing my friend laugh as I fell
2. Losing grip of the backpack. It fell on my face.

The past couple of nights have been cold enough for frost, and all the plants were wilting so I went outside to clear all of the dying plants out of the garden.

I didn't put gloves on, as the plants were not thorny, and they were dying, so there was no difficulty grabbing and pulling.

I got to [this](http://i.imgur.com/E2ew7D3.jpg) plant. I reached down to grab the base of the plant and my hands closed around a chunk of mud...

So I get asked to bartend this wedding with a friend. I think fuck it and say yeah me and my best bud will do it. My friend says, ""yeah I've bartended at a wedding before it's great you can get drunk with everyone and everyone loves it"". My friend is my best mate, and brings the super retard idiot out in me. The day before I had just finished my final huge exams for my degree, and wanted to blow off some steam.

So we rock up at this bartending gig, I've never done it before. Say hi to everyone, and the dad running the show is a bit of a dick to me and my friend. Apparently he's a pretty straight edge guy, but these older dudes love to smash scotch. Still quite religious and serious. So we get working and have a few sneaky beverages here and there. We're having loads of fun and the people invited are enjoying our antics and stuff. Talk heaps with all these people, a few being my parent's friends and stuff. Anyways, we start getting tipsy, but we're a good team and killing it as it gets real busy. The older guys are loving it, but we're getting pretty drunk. We're super fun and the party is clearly at the bar. The girl notices and is judging me hard as I ask her what drink she wants and she rudely replies ""Um, I don't even drink"". (You know it that super arrogant way)

Anyways we peak a bit too early and things start going downhill. It's noticeable how tipsy we are, and the dad tells me off. I'm like fuck that guy. So we throw down a few more drinks. By now we're trashed, but I can act classy and hold my shit together. My friend however cannot. He's got those real drunk eyes cranking and people are noticing how fucked we are. Start messing up drinks and stuff. Then my mate drops a whole unopened bottle of vodka without realising. I try clean it up and I drop a huge chunk of glass making it worse. Someone gets us food and I end up destroying my dad's shirt with it.

So in our hammered state we think it'll be genius to stash a bottle or 2 in the garden out back to nick at the end. Just to clarify I'm not ever such a scumbag, but in our drunken state this seemed pretty genious. Then we start cleaning up and stuff. I'm feeling pretty bad so I help out pretty well and hide my drunkness. The older guys organising are happy. However my friend is absolutely fucked at this point and gets caught stealing a bottle. I rescue him and somehow talk my way out of it. Eventually I get our dosh and my friend's dad picks us up. My friend even tells him to ""prime the car as we stole shit"". We get away and celebrate our victory.

The ultimate fuck up? Me sending a picture bragging of stealing shit to everyone on my snapchat. Including the girl who got me the job. FUCK

Rectumwarts00,7,11,1pi6hj,22,"some details:

this would be actually six-ish years ago while i was a sophomore in high school in new york city.
my brother, our friend, our cousin from oregon(female) and a female friend my age went to nyc to show then around since we were from ny except my cousin. we had a hotel room for two nights. no parents and was summer time.

let the story begin.

Day 1:
we spent the first day on canal street (china town) shopping and buying random things and ended up going towards times square. i bought these green new balance shoes since for about $45 dollars to replace my beat up black ones. at night, we went back to the hotel and drank together. i went to a lot of parties but never really drank liquor only cheap beer since i was only a sophomore in high school. so my brother poured us all shots and to show off, i downed my first shot as soon as it was poured thinking i wouldnt have to do any more. turns out, they wanted to do a ""cheers"" and i had to take another. my stomach was already heated. so i patiently waited to take the next shot. as soon as it went down, i grabbed a sandwich that was close by and scarfed it down. i took about two more shots and that was it (mega-lightweight i know, and still am). the night proceeded with us hitting the town drunk. when we got back to the hotel, i knew i would need to use the shit as i always do when having alcohol but it would be too obvious if i was in there too long so i decided to shower before bed as a coverup for the time. so i sit on the toilet after turning on the water.... but i was constipated. so i just showered and headed to bed after setting an alarm to get up earlier than everyone to use the bathroom.

Day 2:
woke up as planed and headed for the bathroom, but was still constipated. now, im not so worried about the stomachaches, so just get dressed and wear new shoes. everyone heads out to grab the car from the parking garage except my brother and my female friend. it was his chance for a hookup, which semi bothered me since it was my friend, but it wasnt a big deal. so while we were out my stomach started hurting again. while heading back to the hotel, i didnt care about them knowing i was going to take a long shit. walking towards the room, all the stuff was outside and right when we walk up the door shuts and my brother said they already returned the keys. no biggie, ill just use the bathrooms that arent in rooms. so while bringing things downstairs i keep an eye open for bathrooms; i see a couple. problem solved and ill hit them up after the stuff is downstairs.

Incident:
*fast forward* head back up after to go to those bathrooms. get on elevator and head to floor i saw a bathroom. asked the maids where it was and power walked in that direction now that it was prairie-dogging it (rat race reference). get to the bathroom, door. locked. wait, what? why was it locked? no time. turn back and find the maid. paraphrase: ""hey, i need to use the bathroom. my brother just returned the key cards. can you please unlock it?"" she says no. it was against policy. fuck. the desperate man i was, i thought to just shit in the stairwell and wipe with my boxers so i almost run there. when i arrive, my morals kick in and i know it was too desperate. so i go back out to beg the maid. the walking farts have kicked in 100% from 50% of steps and begin the sweating. can barely hold my butthole closed. then, mid-stride. shit shoots out of my butt probably as enough to fill a workout shaker bottle. now, boxers completely soaked in diarrhea, down my inner right thigh all the way onto my new green new balances and a nice circular pile on the floor. run up to the maid, hey, now its an emergency. she probably smelled the poop and opened it for me. i had the kind of shit where as soon ass (pun) you sit down the full load shoots out. now that it was over, everythings cool right? wrong. my whole outfit was shit stained and my clothes are downstairs (probably 4 flights down). call my brother in a panic and beg him to bring my bookbag up with my clothes and say its an emergency. being the asshole he is, says no and hangs up twice. furious, i call again and finally he reluctantly agrees. wait and hear a knock. open it up and it was my female cousin, who may or may not realize the situation, hands me my bag. i change after wiping myself down. as i head out of the bathroom, i see a huddled group of three housekeepers (2 maids and 1 male). slowly walk past them and make eye contact before realizing their standing right over my shit pile. i can see she was hiding her smile. as i walked away, i died inside. as low as she tried to whisper... i heard the gossip about me and the snickers. i will never forget their faces.

head outside with my bookbag full of my shit clothes and shoes that were sprayed with cologne. no one said a thing and nothing was out of ordinary. except for me. a little more quiet than usual. they thought maybe i was sick or something, but no; just ashamed of myself. 

tl;dr-- drank at night, next morning couldnt shit. left hotel, came back. they checked out. couldnt use bathroom. shit my pants in the hallway all over myself then in the bathroom and had the longest ~30 yard walk of shame past the custodians that saw me.

My boyfriend and I see each other once a week if we're lucky so when we do  we usually get down to some dirty business after getting food and wandering around, stuff like that. I'm an eighteen year old female and he is a nineteen year old male, both legal where we live, just saying. Needless to say, today was no different. 

Started off the date by going to a sushi buffet, then went shopping (got a wondrous deal on clothing thanks to a friend, completely unrelated), and ended up at his place. So we're casually watching some television, occasionally engaging in some makeout seshes here and there, then things started to get steamy. Also, forgot to mention, we ordered pizza beforehand. So of course, the pizza guy arrives while we're halfway through doing the deed, and boyfriend has to go downstairs to pay for the pizza, while he has a boner. Then, after gorging ourselves on more food, we recommence the sexy times -- only to have his grandpa walk in on us (he was mad about the dog peeing in the bathroom or something along those lines). Also, the boyfriend doesn't have a lock on his bedroom door so, yeah. Thinking quickly, the boyfriend reaches over and covers us both with the blanket, effectively concealing us from his grandpa's sight. 

You'd think that any normal person would realize what's going on, laugh, and leave the room, right? WRONG. His grandpa proceeds to walk into the room while we're both under the covers almost shitting ourselves, and he starts PATTING at us from above the covers. Full out grabbing at, what he probably sees as a giant blob underneath the covers. I'm pretty sure at one point he grabbed my head, can't really remember (in denial). Anyways, a lot of shouting ensued and the grandpa left.

Pretty sure I can't go back there ever again.

I brushed my teeth &amp; laid down beside my girlfriend. For once i was the little spoon, which i enjoyed quite well.
Anyway, halfway through the night, i woke up &amp; felt that something wasn't quite right, too tired to care, i slept in again though. After about 2 more of these small ""half-asleep-wakeups"" I wanted to scratch my asshole, which resulted in some cold goo being pressed closer to my butthole.

At this point i excused myself to my girlfriend and went to the bathroom, there i examined the pile of shit that had accumulated in my underwear. It wasn't that large, more like a breaking stretch actually. But more was to come, I took a piece of toilet paper and examined my butthole. There i found a piece of shit. I tried to pull it out from between my cheeks, but it was stuck hard in my crackbeard.

After some painfull pulling, i pulled the half-dried piece of shit out from between my buttcheeks with a fair bit of my crackbeard still attached, ouch. I cleaned myself the best i could and went back to my room where my girlfriend laughed her ass of when i told her. Ashamed as i was i went back to sleep and didn't think much of it until 4 days later, when i shit myself in my sleep, again..

The difference this time was though, that i immediately recognized that i shat myself, and went to the bathroom at once. Because i was so smart to do so, the shit hadn't dried, and i could clean it with toilet paper and a shower. (if requested, i have pics of my shitty underwear)

Genius me thought it would be a great idea to order grilled cheese.  You can probably guess where this is going.  After consuming this delicious product of death, I was off to the last block of the day, physics.  We had a unit test that class that I had completely forgotten about, however, given the material, I was fairly sure that I would ace it anyways.

I dismissed it as nothing but a fart waiting to be released.  20 minutes later, I realized my mistake.  I was about a quarter of the way through the test when I felt the beginnings of a violent shit coming on.  A test had never felt so long in my life.

I then exited the class, keeping my composure rather well if I say so myself, and sprinted to the boys room as soon as I was clear of the class.

So there I was, getting frustrated because my sticky feeling contacts were not budging. Thinking they were just really dry, I decided I would use my finger nail to get up under the edge of the lens. I moved my finger nails along my eye searching for the edge in a pinching motion. Finally I felt the edge and started trying to pull it up. Instantly a stinging pain shot through my eye. ""Wow, these things were on good."" As I got more frustrated and the pain kept increasing, I decided to just keep pulling - I couldn't bare to have these things in anymore.

so my college ultimate frisbee team has a tradition where we go to Montreal to play in a frisbee tournament, we got there friday night and it only took us about 5 minutes to start drinking (drinking age is 18) after a bit of pregame we all went out to a bar, me and four other guys split 2 pitchers, and we went upstairs to meet up with some other guys from the team where we killed another pitcher with some other people, by the end of that bar alone I had about 3 pints worth, and as a relative light weight that was enough to get me going, one of the 4 guys mentioned above had been to Montreal before and knew of this strip club called ""Cafe Cleopatra"" we decided to go. I was excited cause I was about to go to my first strip club

10 minute walk later we get there, we sit down order some more drinks, I ordered another bottle and drank that down and we sat and watched the girls on stage for a bit, I decided I wanted a lap dance, I told the guys, got up, walked over to a stripper and started talking to her a bit before she asked if I wanted any fun, I said yes, she led me to a booth and started dancing, I got really caught up in it cause she took her top off and let me rub her anywhere I wanted, I completely lost track of time and next thing I know my friend (who had been there before) came around to get me, he had to talk to the main bouncer to get him to talk to the mini bouncers guarding the lap dance area to let him get to me to pull me out (he later told me I was in there for a solid 20 minutes), if he hadn't, I probably would have sat there for another 20 minutes, they charge by the song and I ended up going through 6-7 songs racking up a 60 dollar bill plus tip (10 bucks per song apparently). I only planned on spending about 20 dollars there (not a very high class place obviously) The other problem was, I couldn't understand he english very well, she spoke english, just with a french accent. I didn't really understand the charging, I was enjoying the female on my lap too much in my drunken stupor

by the end of the night I had spent a little over a hundred dollars which was about 3/4 of what I had withdrawn that night (I was planning for the whole weekend, solely on food and beer) As a freshman in college, that was way too much for me

I got about half a dozen nicknames by my team which include: Lapdance, Bigtipper, Lady, and Stripper

CioCZ,19,11,1pfh0r,8,"So after reading up on everyone's mishaps, i was unfortunately reminded of a scenario that i went through.  
  
This happened maybe 2 years ago, when i decided that i would take my girlfriend out for a romantic meal to celebrate our 2nd year of being together. The venue for our romantic getaway was a restaurant called ""The Fish Hopper."" It's an upscale restaurant that was overlooking the ocean, where every table was set with silverware and a pre-folded cloth napkin. Anyways, meal goes by fantastically, and here comes the server with our bill. Every time i go to a restaurant, i never look at the bill and just hand my card over. it's my way of showing that i was prepared for the meal and/or the price is insignificant.  
So... here's where the nightmare begins. Rewind to a week before our date. It just so happened that my debit card expired without my knowledge, and i needed a replacement. The replacement came in approximately two days before the date occurred. Stupid me for not activating the card right then and there, but i had no purchases to make, nor did i ever leave the house at all.  
Back to the restaurant, and the server comes back telling me, ""sir, i'm sorry but your card was declined."" at this point, i was caught off guard and blurted ""WHAT!?"" My comment garnered the attention of the people that were near me. The eyes of all the middle aged ladies and gentlemen were looking at the young couple as the server was staring at me. I fumbled to my wallet and gave him another card, telling him to give it a try. I knew that the other card didn't have any money in it, but i decided it was worth a shot to overdraft it. It didn't work. It's been roughly 20 mins at this point since we finished eating and my gf was just looking at me. I talked to the manager and asked them if there was anything i could do. She was actually pretty rude, telling me that if i didn't have the money, i shouldnt have went to the restaurant. At this point, i asked for 10 mins, as i went outside the restaurant and tried making some calls. I called the debit card company for the card that should have had money in it.  
  
It turned out that the debit card that i was given wasnt activated yet, and could only be activated by using the pre-determined pin # that would be sent 3-5 days after receiving the debit card. At this point, i was screwed. It's been 40 mins, with my gf still waiting at the table, as i talked to the manager saying i wouldnt be able to pay. The manager then told me to try and activate my card through faxing my ID to the company and what not, i won't get too much into details cuz it's pretty annoying and i don't remember all the details anyways.  
  
Long story short, after an hour of my gf patiently sitting at the table and the manager being a headache, she decided ""we'll just bill your house."" With that, we were able to leave, despite the commotion i caused and the embarrassment i let my gf go through. I got the bill from the restaurant like two months later, i still didn't pay it due to how rude the manager was. For those that are wondering, my gf didn't give me any grief about this, but it's definitely scarred both of us, in that every time i pay for something, theres a slight hesitation... hoping that it doesn't happen again.  
  
TL/DR; gf sat at table for an hour because i couldn't pay for the meal at a fancy restaurant, hesitation every time i make a purchase, and i never payed the bill.",TIFU by going on a date without being able to pay,19
PanzerKitten,0,7,1pfdes,0,"This happened this weekend.  

I work for a library and on the weekends one of my jobs is to get various newspapers we recieve, stamp them, check them in, then display them.  The extra copies we get, get put back in the room where I originally get them so they can be recycled.

Well I accidentally lumped one of the papers that needed to be displayed with the ones being recycled.  My boss asked me about the paper and I knew what I had probably done. I have to walk through the public floor to get the room with papers.  As I'm walking towards the room I see this homeless guy at one of our tables with a shitload of our magazines spread out everywhere.  He also has his hand down his pants and his arm was pumping up and down.  I wasn't exactly sure if he was pleasuring himself (he could have had an itch) until I got the room and opened the door, which is behind him, and he jerks his hand out of his pants and looks back at me. Caught!  I just slipped into the room and grabbed the paper and took it to my boss.

I went to security and told them.  They went back to where he was but they said they didn't see him do anything.  They said he is just a twitchy guy and I was mistaken.  Bullshit, dude was jackin it.

I sit down and as I'm peeing I'm freaking out, trying to figure out what the rubber is, when I realize the toilet is full of blood. The piece of rubber turned out to be part of my ""labs"", which I had ripped a chunk out of. I guess what had happened is in class, part of the lab got stuck in the lace of my thong, as I walked I further got it stuck, and when I pulled down my thong, it ripped that part right off.

So this whole weekend I stayed over at his house without his parents noticing and mine not caring.

This was all great up until Saturday night when my mom called and asked when I planned on returning home. This started the debate of should I go home tonight and call it a quits or should I stay and watch my boyfriend play at his church Sunday morning with his parents getting home around the time he finishes. Both of us are selfish and kept me over one more night. This was all great nobody knew about it that shouldn't have known and then Sunday morning I wake up earlier than my SO. I decide to go on askreddit and there was a thread about what purchase under 20 $ would they recommend or something of that nature. 

I look at the post and then there was something about a tongue scraper and I kept reading and I am not the most avid teeth brusher but this thread made me feel gross. I have a toothbrush for when I do stay the night (in a guest room and his parents home) and I brushed my teeth. I put it back in the package and left it out due to some car conundrum and drama between SO and his brother. I completely forgot about my toothbrush and we then had to go for him to be on time for work.

lucidviolet,1,3,1pfcbv,5,"Today is my co-worker's birthday, so on the way to work I stopped at the grocery store to surprise him upon his arrival.

I made my way to the Bakery department where cakes and cookies were piled on the main table.  Cookies seemed the less-messy alternative, although my only choices were Oatmeal Raisin and candy-coated M&amp;M.  I began lifting up the canisters -- 3 piled on top of each other -- to find regular chocolate chip (other co-workers are picky).  I put one canister down and tapped the tier next to it...causing a cookie domino.

Everything went in slow motion as I tried interfering with Newton's Law, but it was too late. A bunch of cookies toppled to the ground just as a customer was rolling her cart down the aisle.  She very curtly announced, ""You should tell the bakery.""  As embarrassing as it was, I wasn't going to dash out of the store, lady!  I walked over to the counter and told the baker, ""A display of cookies fell on the ground. I am so sorry.""

His coworker, who was in earshot of the event, stomped over to the product that could not be sold.  I quickly grabbed the Oatmeal Raisins and booked it.

Rob_G,1,11,1pfb2t,11,"I went hiking with a few guys from work . It would have been a great day, but I couldn’t keep my toes warm, and so try as I did to just enjoy myself, the weather, the outdoors, being with my friends, I couldn’t shake the feeling that way down, at the lowest point of my physical being, there was this little area that not only refused to be warm, but it denied comfort to the rest of my body.

My torso was fine. The hat on my head kept everything on top nice and toasty. But my toes sent dramatic distress signals ringing throughout the entire system, “Help! We’re freezing! It’s so cold down here! You’ve got to do something about it! You’ve got to help us out! No time to focus on anything else but right down here! Cold! Cold! Cold!”

And finally I couldn’t take it, I had to stop for a second, I told the group, “Guys, I need a minute, my toes are freezing, I’ve got to warm them up,” and, naturally, everyone stopped, but they kind of looked around at each other, like seriously? This guy’s going to sit here and, what, start undressing because his toes are cold?

And I could tell what they were thinking, so I needed to find a way to get the attention off of me, I asked my friend Doug, “Doug, your feet aren’t freezing? I don’t know what I’m doing wrong here. My boots are waterproof, not that it’s raining, but still, it’s just that, I have two pairs of socks.”

My other friend Pete fielded the question, “Two pairs of socks? You’ve got them both on at the same time?” I nodded. “That’s your problem right there, your feet can’t breathe. We’re doing all of this walking, your feet start to overheat, they sweat, and that sweat starts to get cold. It’s a temperature drop spiraling out of control, and those waterproof boots probably aren’t helping, no ventilation, it’s like a greenhouse in there, but one that’s not at all strong enough to withstand the outside temperature.”

That was a lot that he just said, and I really badly wanted to counter with something, anything, because, first of all, I was asking Doug, and yeah, I did pick Doug kind of randomly, but Pete could have at least let Doug fumble around a little bit, a, “Yeah …  I don’t know …” before butting in like a know-it-all. If Doug didn’t have an immediate answer, at least I wouldn’t have looked like I’m the only one not knowing what he was doing. But now, Pete, calling me out on the double socks.

That was only the beginning, “And what do you have there, cotton socks? Wool?” Was this a trick question? “Cotton,” I answered, and I should have said something else, I should have thrown him a curveball, like synthetic, but I didn’t, and Pete would’ve probably been able to tell anyway, this guy apparently knows everything there is to know about socks, he was shaking his head, “No, nope, nope, you gotta have wool socks. The cotton, all it does is absorb the sweat. That’s not going to happen with wool.”

Then he kind of turned around to address the group, like he was giving a lecture, a sock symposium, “I’m telling you guys, all I have is one pair of good wool socks, and I’m fine, my toes are really warm.” And everyone else just nodded in agreement, meanwhile I was sitting on some log, undoing the knots in my boots. “Easy Rob,” Pete was still on a roll here, “I know your toes must be really cold but don’t take your boots off. It’s much colder outside, even though it doesn’t feel like it. And even if you do manage to warm up your feet with your hands, it’s going to be even worse when you have to put them back inside those damp cotton athletic socks you have there.”

Couldn’t he just drop it? Did he really have to throw in the word “athletic” socks? Hiking is athletic. You need a little bit of athleticism, right, to hike? “Actually,” Pete continued, “I think I have an extra pair of wool socks in my bag,” and that was all I needed, I took off my boots, yes, it was a lot colder out in the air, I couldn’t believe it. But I started massaging my bare feet, I don’t know if it felt good, because my feet were so cold, it was like they were transferring that chill to my hands. Were my hands going to be cold now?

“Ooh, sorry buddy, I must have left them at home. Well, let’s get going, we’ve got a lot more trail to cover.” And everybody started walking ahead, I had to put the wet socks back on, they had accumulated a slight layer of frost after having been laid out beside me. It was miserable. I don’t know why Pete couldn’t have sent out an email the night before, “Hey guys! Since I know everything there is to know about socks, I figured I’d pass along some friendly advice: get a good pair of wool socks!” would that have been too much? A text message? Something?",TIFU by wearing the wrong socks,22

This was on Saturday and my first fuck up **was seeing Carrie**. Anyway, about a month ago I asked if she'd like to go one of those Halloween-themed theme parks on my time off and she was cool with it. So after seeing Carrie we went down to Buena Park and began our misery.

On the drive there I got a call from an old friend that I just had to answer and put it on speaker(note: this ""friend"" is a *world-class* asshole); when I told him what we were doing he kinda went on his own little conversation with himself calling the wife a ""bitch"" and joked ""-Man, women are like condoms, they spend more time in your wallet than on your dick-"" all i could do was hang-up and promise I'll look for new friends, and although I knew it was fucked up I couldn't help but laugh at that last joke, that didn't help...and neither did the traffic.

Then we get there and we get to the hotel up the street and we got a couple hours before they re-opened the park or whatever it is they do at 7 pm, so we get to the room and I kick off my shoes and make for the bed when I stubbed my toe-*all of a sudden I remember the shower I took that morning and the swollen ingrown toenail*-jump back to reality and me out of breath for using every word in the book with her almost pissing herself from laughing and its not even 5.

After grabbing something to eat, we head off for Knotts. First we headed for the ""Slaughterhouse"" and after that I point towards ""MirrorrorriM"" while we're harassed by evil ghouls! Note: I try to have fun and enjoy myself. Anyway one of the ghouls walked by and he like to pick up those metal base line dividers and stomp them when he fucks up and smashes some chick's foot in front of us (I'm surprised  didn't see a TIFU post about that guy, I hope he didn't lose his job, after all nothing is scarier than a lawsuit! Hahaha, aww I hope I'm not the only one who laughed at that). 2 hours later we get in she bumps into a mirror (I'm cleverly hiding behind her from the creepy monsters! Smart right?) her glasses fall **CRUNCH**-""OH shi-"" After a horrible look I lead us out of Mirror house and away from that annoying witch on the speaker whose laughing was getting on everyone's nerves.

Next we go see a play called ""The Hanging"" that's pack with more references than that awful Family Guy game (rather entertaining show I'll add) where they hang somebody famous and I'm laughing throughout and at some point I look over and she's puzzled, guess who only got half of the pop culture references?

Its about 2 am and we head out; we're damp, our feet hurt, I dropped the stuffed animal I won for her in a puddle, those enzymes or fiber (er some shit) kick in I now have an upset stomach, I've no phone (good thing I'm due for an upgrade!), and all I can give her is a half-drenched toy with a smile reeking of defeat and an apology for her boredom when we get back to the hotel.

regretloss,302,211,1peya2,736,"Small backstory: I'm in my second year at university, majoring in Art. I had an assignment about six weeks ago that I managed to persuade a friend of mine to model for me. She agreed provided that I didn't draw her face. She came over to my house, stripped down and posed for me. It was a complicated piece that was going to have several poses from her arranged in a particular way. But she started to get tired after about an hour. On her suggestion, I took photographs of her in the required poses and loaded them on to her laptop so that I could draw from them and then delete them when I was done and that if I needed any additional detail she could pose again but at least it wouldn't be as tiring. The work would still be done in a day but she'd be more comfortable while I worked.

This was fine except that while she went out to the bathroom or to get something to eat etc. I copied the photos from her computer onto a USB drive. Partly so I would have them in case I needed to edit later and shamefully, because she is also quite attractive. She never noticed, the work was finished and she deleted the photos thinking that they were gone forever. I thanked her and left, and things went back to normal.

I didn't think it was safe to leave the memory stick in my house as I couldn't guarantee that one of my roommate's wouldn't find it and look at it so I kept it with me. The photos were buried pretty deeply on the drive so I could use it safely around the place. Until today.

I got a call while I was working on an essay in the library and rushed off. I thought I put everything away safely but a few hours later I realized that the drive was not in my bag at all and that I had no memory of removing it from the computer. I went back but there was no sign of it and no-one handed it in at the desk.

I'm freaking out right now. My friend will freak out if these photos are leaked. It will probably kill her. I've abused her trust and she's going to pay for it. I can't tell (I just can't have that conversation with her) but I hate the thought of these being passed around and her just being blind sided by it.

I didn't feel it mid wank but now, after all is said and done, my penis feels like someone rubbed molten rock over my glans. I've had several ice cold showers but it's still utterly excruciating. I'm considering getting a bucket of ice, next.

Merrimux,53,32,1pdn3o,83,"So I'm an idiot. There's this girl that lives across the hall from me that I guess I'm somewhat taken with. I try not to let on too much but I'm a moron and so when she invites me to partake in long, four hour activities riddled with social interaction I say: Fuck the essay I have due to tomorrow, I'll just take a gigantic swig of whiskey so I can deal with my social anxiety and enjoy the next little while.

By the time I'm done with the activity I'm ready to work again, but regrettably I'm still drunk (Because I'm a fucking moron) and I'm seriously lacking in time. So what do I do? Fill my body with more harmful liquids! I went out and bought a lot of Red Bull. In the past 12 hours I've consumed 7 red bulls and a 5 hour energy thing. I'm pretty sure the essay I've just written is completely incomprehensible but I can't tell because my mind is too fucked to recognize what does and does not make sense. Like how can I be so stupid? Want to know what I did yesterday morning instead of writing my essay? I'll show you:

I added random games to my steam library and found or created tiles for them so I could look at my games in grid view and admire how pretty they were. I must be a new breed of moron.

So now I'm sitting here in the dark with my heart beating fast enough that I can actually hear it. My essay is due in about six hours from now and I can't go to sleep to refresh my mind because I'm too hopped up on caffeine and I can't write for shit because I'm going to have the mental capacity and literacy skills of a chain smoking toddler until I get some rest. Hell I bet even the stuff I'm writing *right now* doesn't make sense.

I can't tell if the pains in my chest are stress related or if my heart is just getting ready to give out. Oh well, I guess I earned this. Maybe I'll do some jumping jacks and help the little sucker out. Would certainly solve *one* of my problems.

**Update:**

So I fell on my bed and prayed for about 20 minutes. I'm not the religious type but I basically said I'd do volunteer work if the G man delivered me through the day unscathed. I lay down to try and nap and I kept getting graphic sexual images in my head and I was totally convinced it was God testing me. I still have faith that he will help me because those were some seriously graphic images and my member remains unwanked. So anyway I just woke up with 3 hours until my essay is due. My kidney hurts, my tongue feels like a cheese grater and my mouth tastes uncannily like my own blood. Yes, my essay is pretty retarded. I appear to have started paragraphs and then gotten frustrated at myself before mashing enter until I didn't have to look at them anymore so I have lots of useless crap at my disposal... Also my word count is therefore a total lie.

Still not a good day, friends.

**Update2:**

Oh God my neighbor is texting me, talking about how she didn't want to be up all night worrying about me. She says she likes me but my lack of maturity regarding my work and liberal consumption of alcohol and energy drinks (further adding to my immaturity) is what kills her interest. Is that irony? I can't even tell anymore.

**Update3:**

Sitting in lecture right near the front. The energy drink shits are brewing vigorously. I'm not gonna make it until the end and I'm worried if I get up and leave my prof will make a comment and everyone will look at me and I'll shit myself in fear. I can't even pay attention to what he's saying. Why am I even here?

I'm going to do a final update for those still lingering. I just slept for 14 hours, right through all my classes. The girl professed her affections for me... No idea why.

I'm going to say I've learned my lesson but I don't believe for a second that this will be my last fuck up. Look forward to sharing my failures in the future.

throwaway629349,0,17,1pdlza,0,"This is a story about technology, inconsistent standards and assumptions. 

I've been separated from my wife for a couple of years. We live separately and pursue separate lives and romantic lives, but are still kind of friends because we have a child together.

We all have our faults and one of hers is that she can get drunk and make nuisance calls and for that reason I prefer her not to get to know my girlfriends. 

One day my phone ran out of battery and as I had to call her to discuss childcare I used the girlfriend's phone to do it, inputting the digits that prevent the phone from sending caller ID. I make it clear that i've lost my phone and she should email me to resolve childcare issues.

Anyway, as I discover when she returns the call to my girlfriend's phone, those digits only stop the caller ID on fixed line phones, not mobile phones. You have to use a setting in the phone's menu system to do that.

So I got some of those scent boosters that you shake into the laundry to use when I was going to be air-drying stuff. I used it really sparingly, and never in anything that would be frequently touching sensitive areas, and it totally resolved the issues.

Fastforward to yesterday. I had left some workout clothes in a ball, and they smelled pretty bad so when I did the laundry, I added scent boosters. However, this was a load of laundry that also had a lot of underwear in it. I did not think about this at the time.

The13thOutlander,5,8,1pcx8e,20,"Been lurking this sub about as long as I've been on Reddit, finally made an account and then decided to contribute. I never really thought I had a fuckup bad enough to warrant putting up, but I thought about it for a while and this one qualifies I think. This happened when I was a freshman in high school so about 8 years ago now. 

When I was a freshman I was in JROTC (Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps) and every Wednesday we had to wear our uniforms to school, we would have a dress inspection, the whole shebang. During the colder months we would wear our full Class A's with the jacket. Our inspections required a white undershirt and black socks specifically, and I only had a couple white t-shirts of the type that we needed. Sometimes I would just throw on a wrinkled one just because I didn't have a fresh clean one ready. You can probably start to see where this is going. 

Now, at the time, I had these two cats, and they were good cats but sometimes they could be real pricks. They would piss on piles of laundry (especially if it was fresh, sitting on top of the washer folded, even) for no reason most of the time, and especially when they were agitated about something. They were sneaky bastards too, for obvious reasons, so we never caught them in the act. My cat in particular was an expert at opening the doors in my house so he would get in my shit and fucking piss on it. 

So it's a Wednesday, I wake up and quickly take a shower, start putting on my uniform and getting ready for the day. I am looking around for a white t-shirt and the only one I see is a wrinkled ball of white sitting on my dirty laundry hamper where I had tossed it a week before. I grab it, throw it on, put on my dress shirt, my tie, my jacket and run out the door to catch the bus. Sitting on the bus I am already getting faint whiffs of piss odor, but I don't dwell on it. The connection hadn't been made yet. 

I had Phys Ed 4th period of the day, JROTC 5th. Throughout the day I had these inklings of something that stank, but my stupid brain doesn't associate it to me. Occasionally I can tell other people are aware of it and are seeking the source as well, but still I am oblivious. It isn't until Phys Ed that I realize my mistake. Half the day had already passed. 

The worst part, in my opinion, is that I didn't realize it until I had come back to the locker room from PE. I had changed entirely out of my uniform into a different shirt and shorts. It wasn't until I was putting my uniform back on, when I threw on the white shirt and tucked it into my pants as I pulled them up, that my friend in PE who was changing nearby looked up and said, ""Dude!!"" and started laughing... My other friend looked up and started laughing as well... The smell was suddenly so obvious to me, I couldn't believe I hadn't noticed it earlier. 

I looked down and my shirt was covered with dry cat piss all over the right shoulder and chest, underarm... It was horrible. I ripped it off and threw it to the floor as my friends died of laughter. No one else in the locker room seemed to notice what was happening so that was good, and I quickly retreated to the lost and found bin and found an oversized white shirt I could use that had the added advantage of not being covered in piss. 

I wonder how many people knew that it was me that stank of piss, or that it was in fact piss. I wondered if they could see it. Most likely. I managed to live that down and at least I didn't go to inspection with a piss-soaked shirt on, but that was probably my biggest fuckup ever. And I was just a freshman, I had to work hard to bury that and not have the fucking worst high school experience ever. Anyways that's my story, thanks for reading folks.

Death2DrunkSasquatch,6,9,1pcte3,0,"I was out with some friends last night, and we were all drinking really heavily, but I stopped early to sober up and drive home. We got back to the house, and everyone crashed there. My friend and I were sharing a bed due to lack of available space, and after the other people in that room fell asleep, things just kind of...happened.

It wasn't sex, but we made out heavily and grinded on each other until we both came. The problem is, he lives with his boyfriend of several years, and I knew that going into this. I feel awful, especially because, although I don't take it upon myself to monitor other people's behavior, I take a very clear stance about cheating in committed relationships.

I'm concerned that this is entirely my fault...I've known for a while that he was attracted to me, and I've been flirty, mostly because I've had a lot of bad luck romantically lately, and enjoy the attention. I didn't initiate what happened last night, but I definitely could have stopped it, and know that my leading him on hasn't helped the situation.

DanniiTheFannii,2,9,1pb5jx,0,"A few people from a post I submitted on this sub a while ago wanted to hear another story about the music department [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1p5vk6/tifu_by_doing_a_weewee_behind_the_school_piano/) is the first story about pissing behind a school piano. 

So, without further-ado, here's the story about the time I said my music teacher's husband has ED. 

As before, I'll include some background info:
- My music teacher had gotten married over the summer holidays, and this incident happened in about November. Around about the time of the piss incident. (Still in Year 10 in this story)
- The teachers at my school joke about a lot with the students. A teacher would call another student something offensive and we'd get on with it, it's natural at this school. 
- This particular teacher is very 'up herself', but will sometimes have her good day. **DAY**. Let's call her Miss Yellow.

It was a month before the *Christmas Carol Concert* was due to take place, and our school would always put on some stupid show. Being a strong atheist, I don't like doing this, but I do it because I love music and it seems stupid not to, plus my friends do it and it's a laugh. This year we're doing Mistletoe &amp; Wine. I have a friend, and let's call him Joe. Me and Joe have a weird sense of humour, and we'll often joke about things without realising how bad the joke is. We're definitely going to Hell. 

Joe, for reasons I'm still unclear of, took Music as a GCSE. He hates the lesson and doesn't play an instrument. For Mistletoe &amp; Wine he had the luxury of playing the shaker. Even Miss Yellow had given up hope, and he's still on the course somehow. Anyway, instead of playing the amazing instrument that is the egg shaker, he was fucking about with a drum stick and hitting it against the desks to piss off the teacher. He got a splinter, and Miss Yellow was happy about this and laughed. Joe said ""Miss, I can't get it out!!"" to which I replied ""You can't get it *up* either, can you Joe?""

We laughed. It wasn't the most offensive joke ever, it wasn't even offensive, but we laughed. 

""Dannii!"" from my music teacher was what broke the laughter. I, innocently, replied with ""but miss, how did you know we were talking about *that*?"" to make her seem like the 'bad' one. 

""THAT'S BECAUSE HER NEW HUSBAND HAS IT. HAHAHAHAHAHA!!"" exclaimed Joe. 

Nice one..

It was very funny, the 'group' I hang about (there's 4 of us) all laughed. The rest of the class was either laughing or was silent in shock at what he said. I silently, but loud enough, said ""yeah"". 

""Dannii!"" Miss Yellow shouted again. 

*Oh shit*. You could tell when she's not happy.. And she most **definitely** wasn't happy. 

""Both you boys go to see Miss Red* and tell her what you said!"" (Hey, that rhymed..) *Let's just call the other music teacher Miss Red. 

I continue playing guitar, and Joe goes to see Miss Red. All's fine until Miss Red comes through the door and asks to see me. 

*Double shit*

Now, me and Miss Red get on quite well, as she sees me as a very good guitarist and will often call me, and my other 'guitar friend' (of whom is in the 'group') A* students. But this time I knew I had fucked up. 

She took me out and there was Joe. He was standing there with an expression on his face that looked as though he was constipated, but he was obviously trying not to burst out into laughter. I had to repeat the entire story to Miss Red. She wasn't happy. She gave us a 'double red card'. This meant that we had an instant SLT (Senior Leadership Team - basically the principal and other people high up in the school) detention. We had to go to the drama teacher and tell him what we did and that we had received a double red. 

He laughed. A lot. He said ""well, you still have to stay for the detention, but you won't have to stay for the SLT detention. Just don't let it -laughs- happen again""

Miss Yellow was happy because she doesn't like us. Miss Red said that she only did it because it was the 'right' thing to do, but found it slightly funny nonetheless.

From the past few days, I could smell a faint but rancid smell near my door. I thought maybe Ive missed the water change on one of the containers. So I checked all the containers beneath a shelf just besides the door. All of them had their water changed according to the schedule, and all the fishes were healthy.

A few more days passed, and the smell became stronger gradually. Today the smell became unbearable, so I decided to change the water in all the containers regardless of the schedule.

Today was no exception. He sent me a text : ""heading out, I'll let you know when we get back in. You should put the red lace on.""

I had a better idea.. I'll put the red lace on, then video a strip tease. So, I did just that.

Why not take it further? 

I get out my while pure romance collection, and video me using each one (4) in short 3 minute videos then take a few still photos. All finished, I put them all in an album format text, then pushed send.

Post orgasm, I figured i'm sated enough until he gets home tonight. I cleaned, dried and put away my toys. Shower time!

My phone now on the charger being, i'm not expecting a text back, I take my time drying my hair, getting dressed and ready for the day before my kids wake up. the main reason I keep my phone on silent.

6:23am my phone rings. It's my dad. ""Good morning, I see""
Confused I say ""Good morning, what are you up to today?""
""Well, with the text I got this morning from you, i'm guessing cleaning out my phone and giving my son in law a pep talk""

My husband's name is next in my contacts to my father, I had sent 9 videos, 13 still photos, and a description of how my husband likes to fuck me, and how I want it when he gets home, to my father.

He thankfully didn't read the whole text, but he has an iPhone, so he saw a picture of me in my red lace, halter, babydoll lingerie holding 3 dildos, and a butt plug.

Anyway last saturday I was watching netflix on my ps3 and using my laptop while relaxing in my huge recliner chair. I was there for about 2 hours and my back and legs started to tense up, so I decided to stretch to get rid of that annoying feeling. Well my laptop was resting about the middle of my stomach and didn't think that it would cause a problem if I would arch my back to stretch it. Here's where I fuck up; after stretching my legs I arch my back high off the chair and immediately began to yawn, without thinking I take my hands off the laptop and put them over my head to complete the stretch.Turns out the grip on my laptop wasn't as good as I remembered, the fucker slid off of my stomach like a computer water slide into my exposed teeth and chipped about half of my right front tooth and 1/3 of the left one. As i'm sitting there putting the pieces together as to why I was now holding my teeth, I realized how stupid I was to not take literally 5 seconds to put the computer on the floor. Also I had my best friend in the same room which made everything worse because after he saw he was on the floor howling with laughter. Needless to say the evening was ruined.

He's our area manager. 

I'm scrolling, scrolling, nothing interesting. Talking about the travelling he's done for work recently, a few awkward ""Anyone want to hang out this weekend?"" statuses with no replies and one particular picture shared from a group.

Since the local ""certified"" apple service centers can't figure out what the hell is going on with my devices, I had to schedule an appointment with an apple genius at the nearest retail store, which is 3 hours away! 

Tonight, I traveled to the city since the appointment is early tomorrow morning. Once I got in town, I stopped to get something to eat, before going to the hotel, only to realize I do not have any money to pay.

First, I realized that my credit card was missing. It could've slipped out my pocket since it's been sliding recently due to my pants being loose from weightless. Since I tend to be absentminded and lose my belongings, I stopped carrying my debit card a long time ago. I do, however, carry extra cash in my bra. Just my fucking luck, when I reach for my extra money strategically placed under the bigger boob for extra security, I find nothing. Just then I remember that I had placed it on the nightstand when I masturbated--Yes, girls fap too--earlier and I must not have put it back. 

 A friend tried to get me a hotel room over the phone, but apparently they need me to have a credit card to put on file, and he can't leave to wire any money. I don't have any friends in this town, so basically I'm screwed, at least until morning when I'll be able to go to the bank. 

So, now I am downtown in an unfamiliar city without any money. If only I had put it back in my wallet like a responsible person or if I carried a purse like a normal girl wouldn't be an issue. Ugh!! 

So, I don't know what I am going to do about a place tonight, and I am so fucking tired. Thankfully, there was enough change in my backpack to buy a cookie, so at least I can linger in here until they close, but then what? It's already nearly 1am and I'm tired. 

Of all the times my losing stuff has fucked me this has got to be the worst consequences. Fuck me.

I went to see my buddy who lives about 20 minutes away from me so, as you do, I drove there.

About an hour passed before I had to leave his house, so I got into my car and started heading home.

About 5 minutes after I started driving I could hear a grinding noise coming from my engine. I thought maybe it was because I was low on fuel it was making that noise.

This was my first fuck up.

A few minutes later I find the road I need to go down is closed. I haven't been driving for long and there was no diversion so I ended up in bum fuck nowhere.

The noises from my engine started getting worse to the point that my car would cut out if the revs got too low.

Of course now I was panicking. Luckily, they reopened the road and I just managed to pull my car over to the side of the road closer to my house.

I rang my mum and dad to come and get me because there was no way I'd be able to get my car home.

We also had my dad's mechanic friend come out to diagnose the car. He said it was terminal. Fuck. I've only had the car for a month.

Anyway, long story short, I called the guy I bought it from who is a family friend and he had it towed and fixed. He said that the water cooling pipe had split so there was no water in it and the fuse for the main cooling fan had blown, which is apparently a large fuse that takes a lot to blow. So pretty much the engine overheated and killed itself.

If I had stopped the car earlier it would have cost about £20 to have fixed. Because I was a dumbass and kept on driving it had to have a new engine. It ended up costing me over £400.

Ok, so my back has been stiff recently. I work at a desk. After sitting with clients all morning, my back was really hurting, and I needed somewhere to stretch it out. I first tried to do it standing up in the bathroom, but those stretches didn't reach the right muscles, so I knew I needed to lie down to do it. Clients are always coming in and out of my office, so I knew I had to find a place that was out-of-view. I decided to do it underneath this big conference table because no matter where you walk, you can't see underneath it, unless you're bending down.

My break was an hour long, so as soon as it started, I got under the table and stretched. It was awesome; after a few minutes, my muscles finally relaxed, which felt amazing. I still had like 45 minutes left, and no one had bothered me, so I thought ""what the hell,"" and decided to close my eyes [edit] and sleep [/edit] for a bit. 

When my alarm vibrated in my pocket, signaling the end of the hour, I opened my eyes to see a bunch of legs sitting around the table--THERE WAS A CONFERENCE GOING ON!!

I had a client at the top of the hour, so I knew I had to leave, and in my head I'm like *nononononono how am I going to explain this*, but I couldn't wait for them to finish--it was clear that they were in the middle of it and weren't ending anytime soon.

Very slowly, I pushed one of the empty chairs out from the table. Everyone above stopped speaking--I could tell they were looking at the chair, seemingly moving of its own volition.

Walking for about 15 minutes, just beyond half way, my tummy got sore. I thought I had to piss. But no, a little further and I realized I was about to shit my pants. However, I'm far enough that I can't turn back and it'll be quicker to get to kal tire and drive home. But then it starts getting really bad. I'm freaking out because I'm about to liquid shit on the sidewalk in broad daylight. If I run, it's going to leak out, but if I walk I won't make it there in time.

When this second employee finally arrives, I'm sweating more than a chubby charles at Burger King. He starts telling me about what they did and what they rotated. Meanwhile all I hear is the gurgling of my tummy, infested with beer hops, wings, eggs, and a recent avocado sandwich. He presents the key while still talking. I yank it from his hand and pull out my credit card. Hint hint good sir. He tells me it's actually a free service today due to my past visits, and the fact that they didn't do much anyway. I thank him. I exit quickly toward my car but a sudden grumbling stops me in my tracks. It was going to be over within seconds. This was it. This was its final form and my last stand.

She says she will take her to the vet.

I get a text around 3:00pm.  She has arrived home.  The dog is dead.  When she got back, the dog was lying limp on the couch and she rushed her to the vet, but she died as she was pulling into the parking lot.

***A bit of background***

My school turned into an academy 4 years ago (shit loads of money has been pumped into it to make it a better school as the school was only having 20% of the students getting 5 A*-C grades. With all the money the school gets better facilities such as buildings, equipment and teachers). We moved into 'temporary buildings' while the old school was being knocked down and the new one was being built. The music department was in the dining hall (they were partitioned by some cheap shitty wall). This meant that the music department still had additional rooms for 'practice rooms'. 

Anywhore, here it goes:

I was in Year 10 (which was last year) and it was a Tuesday. My timetable for Tuesdays in Year 10 was:

* Double Science
* Break
* Double Music
* Math
* Lunch
* English

I got through Double Science and was really psyched for Music (as I am a keen musician and it was an excuse to play guitar for 100 minutes straight). I was in the top practice room with two people in my class. Let's call them Bob and Sarah. 'Bob' seems to think he can play guitar, and so that was why he was in the room with me. Sarah has a guitar, but she is terrible at it. So, I'm stuck in a room with these two knobs. Sarah, at the time, had a huge crush on me and was constantly hugging me and whatnot. 

I have a weak bladder. In fact, weak doesn't even begin to explain it. I have the urge to piss. I look at my phone and see that the time was 13:00 **SHIT!** It's now Period 5 (I should be in Math; the teachers completely forgot that we were in the practice room). Math is pretty shit because the teacher is shit, so I decide to stay in the practice room a bit longer and play guitar.

Still need to pee. I have now resorted to jumping about like a fairy.

I stop suddenly.

""GET THE FUCK OUT!"" 

Both Bob and Sarah leave the room immediately without objection. I run over to the piano as it's the only cover from the window and the door, so at least if I get caught I have a bit of time to 'recover'. I proceed and widdle behind the school piano.

*I have the **best** fucking piss I have ever had in my life*

However, the men reading this will be able to agree that when you're bursting for the toilet and pull out your willy, you sometimes get a bit too excited and a little pre-pee comes out. Well, that's what happened to me.. Besides it wasn't a little, it was a fair amount. I had basically just pissed all over my school uniform.

*Fuck*

I cover up the puddle with a pillow that was, for some reason that I am still unaware of, was in the practice room. I also open the window so that it doesn't smell, I also move the pillow out of the sunlight.

Bob and Sarah return into the room. Sarah returns to hugging me, as she did 24/7 back then. ""Umm.. Dannii.."" 

.. Great

TL;DR I really needed to piss so I did it behind the school piano. Some of it went onto the floor, but the majority went over my school uniform and I spent the rest of the day smelling like a dirty tramp.

The valuer was almost finished when he asked me how much I would buy it for. I told him I'd buy the property for the land alone and demolish the house. Because termites.

Spagster,269,2623,1p554s,2940,"I work a few miles away from where I live so I usually go home for lunch.  I've saved tons of money, I get some time to myself, and generally it's just an enjoyable hour.  I was in a pretty good mood today and when I'm in good mood I love to have jam sessions in my car.  Today was the Foo Fighters.  I'm cruising down the road, blasting some tunes, paying attention to where I'm going but not much else.  There is a somewhat dangerous turn that I have to make to go home.  It's a stop sign about 100 feet away from a pretty curvy turn through some thick tree/bush/overgrowth stuff.  Basically you look both ways and get to scootin' and hope for the best.  

I looked to my left, didn't see anyone, took that as my cue and made a right hand turn.  I'm having a great time with the radio cranked up, anticipating some delicious sandwich that I wanted to make, and that's when I realized what was going on.

I caught up to a car in front of me and started noticing that there were a bunch of cars in front of that one...all with little flags on them.  Oh, shit.  It's a funeral procession.  ""Well at least I'm a the back of it!  I'll slow down, give them some space out of respect and I'll be on my way.""

For about a minute or two everything seemed fine.  The funeral procession took a turn down a different road, and I continued on my way...then I noticed there were cars behind me.  A lot of cars behind me.

I don't know how it happened because I always thought that funeral processions drove pretty tight together.  I thought cops were always hanging out with these things, but I didn't see any.  I'm not sure if it was the curvy road, a stop light, or what...but the damn thing got split in half...and I was in the middle!  AND I AM LEADING IT NOW!

I have a flag on my car.  It's an Ohio State antenna flag (Go Bucks!) and I love it, but today it fucked me over. [Looks kind of like this one](http://images.footballfanatics.com/FFImage/thumb.aspx?i=/productImages/_186000/FF_186124_xl.jpg&amp;w=180).  It was close enough in color to the maroon/red/some-color-that-I'm-sure-has-a-name that the others had on their flags I suppose, and maybe people got confused, because that whole line of cars was following me.

I turned into my neighborhood, and so did they.

I turned onto my street, and so did my following.  I was leading these people off track and there was nothing I could do about it.  I was the shepherd and they were my sheep.  Poor sheep.

I'll be honest guys, I took the cowards way out.  I really did.  I opened my garage door when I was a house away, pulled into my garage, and closed the door.  The line of cars was basically stopped in front of my house.  They eventually drove off, aimlessly wandering, looking for the rest of their herd.

I ate my sandwich is silence.  It was a pretty fucking delicious sandwich - sourdough, turkey, avocado, cheddar cheese, hot sauce and some Doritos for that extra crunch - but I'm sure it would have been even better had I not ruined that damn procession.

I had not been aware of this watercut, noone had told me, there were no warnings or signs about it. and most imporantly enough... the valve above the sink had nothing on it about it not being touched which it should have.

Part of the system is a sub-system to help student recruiters to call students by pulling up the name and number of a student to call who has not yet been called. At some point, this shifted into a system for student recruiters to use to make acceptance calls.

Here's the fuck up - I never added a checker to see if the student being called had been accepted.

So tonight the system went live (without anyone else looking at it I suppose) and student workers began calling students and congratulating them on their acceptance.. until:

Today, no more than 20 minutes ago in fact, I was merrily sitting at my desk browsing Reddit and doing some reconciling for September. Suddenly - and violently - I felt the urge to shit. Now this isn't really anything new to me because I have Colitis; this means that when I get the urge to poop, I'd better find a toilet *fast*. I'm fine one minute, and the next I'm prairie doggin'. That's my life with this illness.



However, this particular instance, it hit so quickly I could feel my butthole puckering rapidly to try to keep it inside of me. ""Well fuck,"" I thought, as I scurried to the usually-empty break room bathroom. The bathroom three flights of stairs below me. Luckily it was empty as I had hoped. Just as I thought I was home free, I pulled down my pants and a smell emanated. There was a blob of diarrhea in my panties. Fuuuuuck!



Whatever, I'll just wipe that shit out while I'm doing my thing on the toilet. A massive dumpy diarrhea comes out, which requires several wipes. Too much toilet paper; now the fucking toilet is clogged, on top of my shitty underwear problem. Great. 



I make my stealthy exit back upstairs and, try as I might to get all the poop out of my undies, I can still smell it as I'm walking. I don't want to be smelly for the last two hours of work. 



Then I saw a ray of light through all of this - I am headed out right after work so I had a complete change of clothes in my car! I had forgotten about this savior! I ran out, got my bag, went in the bathroom right next to my office to change, plastic bagged the dirty ones, and brought all the evidence of changing back out to my car.



On the way back up to my office, I heard two co-workers discussing how bad the bathroom downstairs smelled, and that it must have been Jeff that clogged it. Poor Jeff.



So folks, today is the day I shit my pants. I never thought it would happen to me. Especially after all the laughs you guys have given me about pooping in yours.

My brother (who is very christian and is waiting till he gets married to have sex) turned 26 so my parents put a little shindig together. Not far from town we got this awesome place with a sweet layout, enough beds for 10 and it had a pool. 

Anyway, the night of the birthday bash a bunch of his friends are there, my parents as well as myself and my girlfriend. The party goes late and my girlfriend and I retire for a bit of alone time. The next morning she reminds me theres a condom under the bed and I should take care of that. So I shove it in the pocket of my shorts and move on to breakfast. A little later, I'm enticed to go swimming as a serious game of pool baseball is breaking out. Pretty much everyone is in or around the pool. I jump in to bat  and two seconds later I see the blue condom wrapper float to the top. It takes a second to register what it is but with ninja reflexes I scoop it up before anyone gets a good eye on it. My brother who saw something coloured loudly asks ""What's that blue thing?"" conveniently drawing everyones attention on me. With the wrapper secure I quickly fumble around seeing if the actual condom is there. My heart stops, my pocket is empty. Looking around it the water it hasn't surfaced yet, so I scoop my hands hoping to catch it before the bitch surfaces. My sweeping hands push the water around drifting the condom further away and it surfaces well out of my reach, perfectly on display.

I've just recently learned that I had my high-beam switch perpetually forward, which means that every time, every instance I used my headlights, my high-beams would also turn on. So basically, morning and night. Every bloody time I would go out during those hours. 

So for about...I would estimate, 2-months solid, I've been driving like a fuck-up. I'm sorry everyone I blinded. Also, I actually didn't know that you're not supposed to leave your high-beams on, in the occasion someone passes you. So I *literally* blinded everyone I passed.

GoldXP,13,9,1oym5m,18,"I graduated High School when I was 18. When I left I got along very well with two teachers. You know those teachers that you feel like you could trust and confide things in? That's what they where to me. Let's called them Mr Blue and Mrs Red. When I graduated I stayed as a math tutor. For my 18th birthday I swept Mrs Reds classroom and helped move stuff around. She thanked me, gave me a birthday card, and reminded that she was their for me whenever I needed anything (Mr Blue would tell me the same thing). Around the time I left as a tutor was also Mrs Reds birthday. I gave her mittens and birthday card. The next day she wrote me an email telling me how she loved the mittens, the card I gave her made her cry, and she wanted to buy me dinner. I returned the next day, she received me with a warm hug, when I told her that she didn't need to buy me dinner, she insisted that we must have dinner to catch up. I also called her by her first name. At her request and insistence.

We never did go out for dinner.

Fast forward about a year later comes Mrs Reds birthday again, so I buy a stuffed Elephant. I went to the school, the office lady told me that now I needed to make an appointment before I visit teachers. I said ""That's fine, I understand"". I asked the office lady if I could leave it with her and come back another time. I asked Mr Blue if I could stop by next week for one last visit before I went on about my life. He agreed. 

I returned the following week, and that's when shit hit the fan and my world turned upside down.

I arrived on campus, and before I got to say a word the office lady called the Principal. She called saying ""Uhhh...John Doe is here"". Immediately the principle says she wants to talk to me outside. We went outside when she informed me that I had made Mrs Red very uncomfortable with my gift, she lectured on how inappropriate it was for a student to give teachers gifts, and the death blow being that I was no longer allowed on campus. That would explain the dirty looks people gave me when I walked in.

I felt very disgusted and insulted by what she was telling me. Even if I was allowed back on campus, I don't wanna go back. My name is mud, everyone thinks I'm some kind of sexual deviant, a criminal that needs to be locked away. I swallowed my emotions, apologized and went on my way.

I got in touch with Mr Blue the next day and he informed me what was going on. Since the time I last saw Mrs Red, she dealt with two or three students who professed their love for her. The students stalked her on Facebook, one of them threatened to cut / harm himself, etc.

He also told me how he knew what I meant, I didn't know the situation nor did I mean to scare anyone. And regardless of what happened, he would still be their for just like he said he would be. Those words made me feel happy.

I'm going to talk to Mr Blue soon. Hopefully he'll tell me some positive news. 

Right now I'm feeling a mix of emotions. I'm sad Mrs Red is going through that, I'm angry by the ridiculous allegations the Principle told me, and I'm happy that at least one teachers doesn't think I'm a werido. I'm willing to admit I made a mistake. I don't think I should be treated like a criminal because of a simple misunderstanding.

That really was my last day on campus. It just didn't go as I would of hoped.",TIFU By giving a teacher a gift,27

Anyways, I did my homework and ate dinner before my shower tonight. That's the first fuckup. As it turns out, if you're the last one there the shower is almost guaranteed to be cold. And there's no space heating upstairs either, which makes it even colder.

No big deal, I'll just bite the bullet and shower anyway. But shit, this person is combing her hair in the mirror right in front of me, so I don't want to get naked behind the see-through shower curtain and flash her. So I close the door to the shower and de-robe in there, throwing it over the door so it lands outside. That was fuckup #2. The bathrobe became soaking wet on the floor.

But it doesn't end there. The hook where you put your container with shampoo, soap, etc is very flimsy. So after I got myself some shampoo, when I put it back the hook broke and the container fell, scattering my stuff everywhere. I needed to pick the stuff up, but I didn't want to put on my soaking wet bathrobe (the only garment available) So here comes fuckup #3!

SawNakedRussian,161,228,1oy46o,582,"So some of you may have read my TIFU earlier about walking into the bathroom while the very same boyfriend's dad, named Stanislav or Stan, was in the bathtub.

Oops, I fucked up again. Poor, poor Stan.

My boyfriend Josh and I went to Russia for his aunt's wedding. Until the wedding we are staying at his father's dacha, which is basically like a house I guess. Also, I keep a bottle of lube in my suitcase. That's just the kind of person I am. Please contain your boners.

Anyway, I was searching through my suitcase for a nice shirt to wear and pulled out the tub of lube in the process. As I'm cleaning, Josh opens the door and by reflex I cover the lube with a shirt. He doesn't comment, grabs his wallet and goes away.

I flop onto the bed, facing away from the door and play games on my phone with my headphones in (holy crap there's internet in Russia guise) and leave my lube-hiding t-shirt laying innocently on my bed. About half an hour of this and there's a knock on my door.

It is Stan, come to tell me lunch is ready. However I can't hear or see him. So he throws a bean-bag at me. He has learned to keep one on hand because occasionally I'll zone out. The bean-bag hits me on the head, so I turn around and take out the headphones, and throw the beanbag back. He catches my measly throw with vodka-fueled ease and tells me food is ready.

Not one to be defeated, I pick up my shirt and throw it at him. But alas, it is the one with the lube in it! I should have realized by the weight of the little tub, but I didn't. So I hit poor, poor Stan square in the chest with the lube-hiding shirt.

BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE.

Somehow the tub opened, getting lube all over Stan's shirt. The look on his face was one of violated horror as the offending tub tumbles innocently on top of my shirt on the floor at his feet.

Poor, poor Stan mutters what sounds to me as 'Zah chem' with a ch sound in (Don't know Russian) as I scramble over to pick up the tub and shirt. He turns around and leaves.

I've been thinking about trying panties and how they would feel for a few weeks now. I impulsively grabbed them and tried them on. 

They were nice, my butt looked sexy but my balls sticked from a side. When I took them out I smelled... dick. There was a wet spot on the panties. I had jerked off twice earlier, and I had dick cheese. It left a wet spot with strong dick smell. 

I kind of freaked out. I tried cleaning it with toilet paper and a little water, then drying it out with more toilet paper. It was dry and clean before, I didn't want to leave a wet spot or get it wet altogether. 

As the shower ran, I thought, I'm a heavy smoker and I can still smell it. My sis never smoked and has a keen sense of smell. I tried spraying it with just a little air freshener, but I could still smell a little when I pressed it against my nose. Watching it against the light, I could still kind of see a shiny spot. 

I prayed to a god I stopped believing in years ago that she wouldn't notice. I actually did the cross sign against my chest. She broke her cellphone yesterday and she's pissed off about it.

_Jungfrau,5,15,1oxwr7,62,"If the T in this acronym stands for 'ten years ago' then I guess you could say TIFU. Yes this is an old story, one I've been telling for many years and one I've wanted to tell on reddit for a long time (and have never been able to find the right AskReddit thread), but it sure is a corker. It's a long one too, so be warned.

It's Britain 2003. I'm 28, I've been in a proper job for 3 years now, budget airlines are just starting to take off, and my mate Brian is getting married soon.

Now I was not always responsible. Me and my mates, like many others, were part of the huge UK rave scene in the 1990s. In my late teens and early twenties I went to more raves and did more drugs than I can remember.  There were five of us in 'the crew', all guys I went to school and grew up with: me, Brian, Paul, Richard and Wayne. I look back on those years with great fondness (although I guess nobody chooses to remember the hangovers) but as the raves and the drugs and the drinking fizzled out and as we got long-term girlfriends, and mortgages and jobs, we naturally went our separate ways. None of us moved too far from the town we grew up in mind, we kept in touch, but you know the way things are.

Fast forward to 2003 and I get a phonecall from Brian, the one who's getting married. He's thinking of having a stag-do and he's thinking of getting the crew together and doing it like old times. The destination: Berlin - techno capital of the world circa-2003 and one of the few places raving was still alive. We all say yes and start planning.

As a group we think it'll be a hilarious idea to get personalised t-shirts with something crude and embarrassing written on them. It's quite a popular tradition nowadays, not so much back then, I guess you could call us pioneers. Of course, given that we were going to Germany, we couldn't have them written in English, so using my sketchy knowledge of the german language and a dictionary I get to work translating.

We picked each others designs of course, and after deciding to avoid Nazi references, pretty much anything else went. My t-shirt simply said 'JUNGFRAU' which translates to 'virgin' - growing up I was by a long way the last to lose my virginity and so was stuck with the nickname up until the ripe age of 19. I can't remember what Brian had on his t-shirt but it's not important. Because there's only one t-shirt I will never forget, and that was Paul's.

There was one rather hilarious incident growing up where Paul contracted pubic lice, or as they're more commonly known 'crabs'. Even at this point he's still a bit of a ladies man and undoubtedly had plans to get some on the holiday, so on his t-shirt we wanted to write ""Warning, I have crabs"". I look up the word 'crab' in my german dictionary (Krebs), translate the sentence, and send off the design:

'**ACHTUNG, ICH HABE KREBS**'

One 5am Easyjet flight later and we arrive in Berlin ready to party. It's worth mentioning that we were joined by five other guys, friends and family of Brian and his wife-to-be. They all had t-shirts too. Most of the t-shirts had jokes about cocks in poorly translated German. We weren't very creative. Or smart. It wasn't even that funny, but we stuck with it for the first day.

After checking in to the hotel and after consuming copious amounts of German beer we're ready to hit one of the big techno clubs. A this point we've noticed that people have been giving us odd looks all day, but Paul in particular has been getting some very strange looks.

As we're queuing to get into a club, a man in the queue starts getting quite angry at Paul. We initially brush it off as general drunken behaviour, but the guy keeps hounding on at him. Paul doesn't speak any German so he had no idea what this man is saying and starts laughing.  Now furious the man starts to shout in English: ""You think cancer is funny!? You think it's a joke!? You think it's a laughing matter!?"". The guy then grabs Paul's shirt, and Paul being both confused and drunk, punches the guy square in the face. This escalated to a full blown fight, resulting in the police being called, and Paul being arrested.

And as I'm sitting in the police station thoroughly confused about the events that had occurred, suddenly it hit me. 'Achtung, ich habe Krebs' does not mean 'Warning, I have crabs'. 'Krebs' more commonly translates to 'cancer'. For the past 24 or so hours, Paul has been wandering around a city, accompanied by nine guys in lewd novelty t-shirts, wearing a t-shirt saying:
 
'**WARNING, I HAVE CANCER**'. 

And that's how I ruined my friend's stag weekend.

(Disclaimer: I didn't actually ruin the whole weekend, Paul didn't get in any real trouble, and we had a great second night reliving the old times. The shirt was confiscated for being grossly offensive. Thank god we didn't go for any Nazi puns.)","TIFU by mistranslating a german word, making light of a horrible disease and ruining my friend's stag weekend",77

So this didn't happen today, it happened on Saturday. Alright just as some reference, I don't like giving out my age but I will say I am younger then 25 and older then 15, okay. I have not been to a wedding since I was six years old. Alright, time to begin.

---

So, Friday night I decide to eat Moes for dinner. For those who don't know, Moes is like a Subway but for Mexican food in the fact that you tell the people what you want on your taco/'nachos'/etc. I don't eat any type of Mexican more then once or twice a month, home made or otherwise. This is important.

On the same day my [hopefully to-be] girlfriend, let's call her Ashley, also asked me out to dinner on Saturday. Whoo hoo! My first date! *What perfection*, I thought!

Skip ahead to Saturday morning I get a call from my sister, let's call her Em(ily):

""I know this is very last minute and all, but can you be a bridesmaid for my wedding?""

*Oh? Cool!*

""Sure thing, sis!"" I replied. She told me all the info and such, all worked out. But wait...

*Damn fuck-ass! I won't be able to go out with Ashley! Aww, fuck~!*

I hated myself, but I called up Ashley and postponed our outing (we both knew it was actually a date). She was okay and all is good, right? Yep, all's good! Being my second wedding *ever*, I was nervous as hell; but for a few reasons.

Time skip to mid-day, it's wedding time. Yay... not!! 

* Nervous as hell - check!
* Uncomfortable as shit - check!
* Aches and cramps all through my body, check!

*Lovely... I'll be hugging the shitter all night!*

Now you may ask, why uncomfortable? If you were reading this well enough (no offense), you would see two key parts: ""girlfriend"" and ""bridesmaid"". lol wut? Well yeah, [I'm lesbian](http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/1oebgt/i_am_a_lesbian_and_i_missed_that_coming_out_day/); Em and the other bridesmaids were hot as hell. Oh yeah, I guess I *didn't* say that I haven't come out to anyone yet, only reddit, Ashley, and my beta-reader on fanfiction.net.

Alright, I literally barely made it through. Now onto reception or whatever the hell it's called (as I said, it was my second wedding ever, so I'm rusty on all the terms and all), had a dance floor and metric shit-tones of food, and music that was too fucking loud (I swear my hearing is just a bit worse now; music choices were fucking pathetic too).

*Alright, haven't had to rush to the shitter yet, but should be on warning...*

Even if I had to leap my way to le` shitter, I wouldn't have been able to because *everyone* was asking me questions non-stop! There were ~160 people there, yeah. I was barely keeping my sanity with all the hot chicks around. 

Again, I'm a lesbian who hasn't come out yet, and I don't wanna look like a half-assed bisexual slut here. If I have a meltdown then I'll have to rush my ass out and run as far away as possible; I don't wanna anger Em on her day.

(Okay, here comes the fun part to write.)

Dinner time, okay. I gorged myself on Mexican ~24 hours prior and haven't ate since. Well, I will look like an assclap if I don't eat, guess I'll force it down. **NEVER DO THIS, PERIOD!!!** At this point, I had stuffed down a decent six or seven ounces of various food (I believe some steak, potatoes, peppers, and such), and was starting to get the 'gotta-shit-soon-cramps'.

*Oh fuck fuck fuck! Son of a slutbag! I can not be that asshat of a freeloader who rushes to the toilet in the middle of a wedding! Gotta wait a bit!* Oh damn damn damn, the cramps were really bad at this point. That combined with my nervousness and being very uncomfortable made me look... not that well. I put on my best facade but Em saw right through it, as expected.

I kept denying everything and said I was just fine. The last time I was almost screaming, which I hated having to do. I have never felt the need to shit so bad in my entire life (I can not recall ever shitting myself). I wouldn't be able to hold on much longer, physically as well as mentally so I begun looking for a way out. 

*No way. I'm not gonna shit myself in front of 160 people! Nein! Nein! Nein!* 

(""Nein"" is German for ""no""; I have to remind myself not to speak some words in German, even though English is my first language and I know almost no German whatsoever.) The best word is ""decay"", that's what was happening to my ass as well as my brain.

I could feel that I wasn't gonna be able to wait any longer. Meltdown imminent, red alert! Execute order six sixtysix: bolt for shitter. I quickly got up and started walking to the shitter, I didn't run because I didn't wanna look like a whore. 

Nope! My body one-upped me and decided it couldn't wait any longer. Oh shit, literally. It wasn't the liquid shits, but it was the shits none the less; the gates of hell had opened up with full force. My dress was not transparent in the slightest, so I was actually wearing a pair of short shorts under it, and I was fucking happy I did, if I didn't have those on I would have shit all over the floor, and my legs too. Once I was in a stall, I actually slammed the door shut and locked that bitch up, and let me fate come to me. If I had stayed out 20 seconds longer, I would have had a big fucking meltdown; I barely averted it.

(When I have a meltdown, what normally happens is I curl up into a ball in the middle of the floor and scream and cry a lot. Sometimes I even slap and punch myself during the 'big' ones.)

*Oh. God. I just took a massive dump in my shorts and almost had a meltdown... fuck, how can I recover this? Fuck~!*

I had just made a fool of myself in front of 160 people. I felt ashamed to the point where I even pissed myself as 'punishment'. I just stood in that bathroom stall for quite some time as I tried, and failed, to calm myself and figure out how to recover. Ditching my shorts was a no go, I had nowhere to put them and my phone was in one of the pockets too. Just running out was the worst option, I'd be hated for life. Just walking out and explaining was a ""fuck no!"", so that left only one option: call Ashley and hope she can help me abandon ship. Our call went something like this:

""Hey Ash...""

""Hey Saige! What's up?""

""You have to get me out of here!""

""Huh? Where are you, what's going on?""

I just sighed and remained silent with my mouth hanging open.

""Talk to me Saige, I can't help you otherwise.""

""Forget it, you can't help me!""

""Sai-""

*Click.* In hindsight it was a foolish move. But the silence wouldn't last. Soon Em and her new husband, let's call him Alex, burst in.

""Saige, what's going on? What's wrong?""

""I'm fine, Em! Really!""

""No shit! If you were fine you wouldn't have rushed out like that.""

""I'm fin-""

""Bull! Shit! Unlock that, talk to me here!""

""I..."" I unlocked the door sadly, and if anything went wrong I'd just rush out like a desperate bitch who was just dumped. She walked in and confronted me, with Alex keeping guard.

""Hey, what's wrong?""

There was no way out, may as well own up to my crime.

""I almost had a big meltdown... and...""

""And what?""

""I shit myself...""

""Oh? Why so?""

""I ate Mexican last night and stuffed myself tonight. Just slap me now and kick me out.""

""Now why would I do that? Here, I know you have your phone on you, I'll call Ash and get you out. I'd rather you leave then go insane here.""

""No!""

""Why?""

""Because she'll hate seeing me... we were gonna go out tonight and I had to postpone so I could come here.""

""Going out? I don't quite understand.""

""Well..."" I gave a heavy sigh, ""I'm a lesbian and it was more less our first date of sorts."" I couldn't believe I said it. Ash was pretty open about being gay, but I had never told anyone I knew in person aside from her.

""Oh, I'm sorry Saige! You were the only person I knew to call. Well, let's call Ash and get you out of here. We can discuss you being gay later, but I am fine with it just so you're aware.""

""Well... ok, thanks.""

She took my phone and called Ashley, as much as I didn't want her to.

""Saige?""

""This is Em. Can you come pick Saige up? She's not doing to great.""

""Sure.""

Em told Ash where we were at and what had happened.

""Ok. I'll be there as soon as I can.""

""Thanks Ash.""

Soon enough Ash showed up looking fucking beautiful. She picked me up and drove the all but two minute drive to her place. Before we left, I gave a nice speech to all 160 people about me leaving and disgracing myself.

When we got to her place, as soon as the door was shut I more less embraced her and teared up and once again pissed myself in shame.

""I'm sorry! I'm sorry!""

""Shhh~! Shhh~! It's okay, it's okay.""

I embraced her for quite some time as I 'recovered' from my mini-meltdown, per se.

""Do you wanna get cleaned up?""

""I just want you! I want you...""

""Alright.""

I was relieved that she was okay with it. The fact that she even picked me up the the first place really made me like her more; I think it's safe to say I was crushing on her pretty hard.

*Maybe this isn't that bad of a fuck up after all, shitting myself is worth it if I get to be with her.*

""Ashley, I know we haven't gone out much, but I really like you.""

""Saige, I really like you a lot too.""

""Can we be girlfriends?""

""I wouldn't want anything less.""

So it wasn't that bad after all. Shitting myself at my sister's wedding and pissing myself, twice, in shame is well worth it! A few makeouts and coming out to the rest of my close family later, I am now living with my GF. There's not many TIFUs with happy endings like this (or at least mention it) so I thought I'd add in the full event. :) Hope you enjoyed!

TL;DR: Gave up first date to go to sister's wedding. After I shit myself in front of 160 people and pissing myself twice out of shame, I got the girl after all! Being a lesbian is awesome!

Rob_G,30,60,1oxcci,250,"I saw this clip on /r/gifs or /r/WTF a while ago of a guy approaching a whole swarm of bees attached to a tree. He slowly puts his hand through the mass of squirming insects and removes it a few seconds later, totally unharmed. The next time, he goes back in, he pulls off a huge chunk of bees, almost like the whole cluster was a liquid, like he was running his hands through a loosely cohesive whole.

Scrolling down through the comments, I hoped to find some sort of an explanation. And I found it. Someone wrote about how when you find bees attached to a tree or some other object, it means that they’re swarming, that they don’t have a queen to protect, and that they’re incredible docile. It all made sense as far as I could tell, I mean, I’m no beekeeper, but this was proof, right?

So when my wife called me outside a few months later, she was screaming, “Rob! Come outside, come quick!” I went out back and she was standing twenty feet away from the garage. “Look Rob, there’s some sort of a beehive.” And it was just like I saw on the video, there were tons of them, all clustered in the top left corner.
I said to my wife, “You want to see something cool?” and I was just going do it, like I’d run my hands through and my wife would be all scared but after a while she’d see that I wasn’t being hurt. How would she react? She’d probably start asking a bunch of half-questions, like, “But … how? This … what?” and I’d just laugh, making up some nonsense answer like, “It’s all about confidence. These bees are more afraid of you than you are of them. You need to project strong vibes, and they’ll understand that. They don’t speak English, but body language a universal means of communication.”

So I calmly walked toward the hive. “Rob? What are you doing, Rob?” to which I replied, “Hey, I’ve got it. Don’t worry.” And that whole confidence, posture, body language thing, it totally worked on my wife. She saw me chill out, she started chilling out herself. “All right, just be careful. What are you going to do?”

“Watch,” and, you know, even though I was fairly certain that this was going to go just as it did on the Internet, there was still a palpable sense of fear. I mean, even if you’re positive that something doesn’t pose a real threat, a swarm of bees is still pretty scary. I’m not even used to dealing with like one bee, but this? This was hundreds of bees. I got close and the buzzing, which I could hear from back at the house, it grew louder, deafening, I could feel it like a cloud of vibration surrounding the periphery of my being.

I raised my hand toward the swarm and I realized that I was fighting my bodily instincts. It was same feeling I had when I went to this adventure park over the summer. One of the attractions was called the Mega Jump, basically, you climb up to a really high platform, they attach you to this rope and pulley thing, and you jump off, confident that whatever it is they’ve tied you to will slow your descent before you touch ground. Again, even though I knew it was this controlled thing, I still experienced a very physical reaction, a terror really, as soon as I stepped up to the edge.

But this was all in my head, I told myself, and I knew that I couldn’t stand there hesitating for too long. I’d psych myself out, or worse, my wife might get the impression that I didn’t know what I was doing, she might get hysterical again and I’d back out if only to keep her from freaking out. I swallowed the lump down my throat and I reached into the mass.

And the stinging was immediate. I recoiled my hand instantly, it was covered in bees, they were all stinging me. The outer layer of the swarm broke off and started circling my body, my face. I wanted to swat them away, I instinctively started flailing around, hitting myself in the head, which, with my one hand still covered in bees, it was just spreading them to my head, my scalp, the ones that had already stung me and died, it was like they were glued on, and I crushed some of them against my skull.

My wife came over with a bucket of water and doused me, but it did little good. In a brief lapse in between bouts of panic and terror, I regained control of my faculties and ran toward the hose, sprayed as many of them as I could away from my body, and followed my wife who had escaped inside the house.

There were like ten or twelve bees that had made it inside, and right outside, it was just this cloud, a whole nest of angry pissed off bees looking for some revenge. My hand was bleeding, everything was starting to swell, my wife was swatting at the few intruders were still circling our heads trying to exact revenge. I looked at my ballooning hand, she looked at me, she said, “What the fuck Rob? What the fuck?”",TIFU by trying to stick my hand into a swarm of angry bees,310

So it was a beatiful day, I was sitting at home, playing GTA V when my mum came home, and gave me some cream. She said it was for my face and should help my face be nice and smooth. I kinda took that as an insult, seeing as I thought my face was pretty smooth.

So later on that day, I looked at the cream and thought: ""Yeah, why the hell not?"" I regret thinking that very much. So I put a lot of it on my face, and I mean A LOT. Then I wiped my hands and kept going with my day.

Then soon after I started to scratch all over my body. ""Huh, weird"" I thought, but didn't pay any attention to it.

And now, a day later, I wish I had paid attention to it. Turns out, I was allergic to some of the stuff in the cream. Now I have a million spots on me (it's called eczema in English I think) and am on my way to the doctors to have it checked out.

I've been having some personal problems lately, and I'm still getting over a cold, as well as having heartburn, so I wasn't able to get barely any sleep for this Thursday. I'm a computer science student, and Thursdays I only have Computer Science and Philosophy. I went to computer science (we're learning Java), which gets out at 12:00. Since I had around 5 1/2 hours to kill until Philosophy (I didn't realize it was a midterm, I thought it was next week and didn't check my Syllabus like a fucking idiot), I figured I'd sleep until then. NOPE... I slept right through it. I figured oh well, no big deal, we have *nothing important*, right?

Today, I was working at my job as System Administrator at a friend's company (right now I'm the most skilled person there in that regard, which is funny cause the other developers are computer science majors as well), and while I was waiting for some files to download I decided to quickly hop online and check if anything was coming up on my Syllabuses.

bearplanes,8,9,1ovqkv,10,"So this happened last night, ended earlier.

I was in an unfamiliar city with a club to visit some gardens and such. The profs let us free in the downtown area, and we had to be back at the bus by 10:00 (from 8:00). As a group of out of town students, finding a place to eat was difficult. After we walked around and smoked a joint, we ended up going to a Himalayan restaurant. Everything had unfamiliar names, and I just chose a veggie dish with ""nine veggies"" to be safe. 

Disclaimer: I had a milk/soy allergy thing as a kid that would fuck up my intestines, but I grew out of the milk allergy.

So our plates come after like an hour (important), and I start eating this dish with coconut sauce, and its wonderful. After some poking to see the mystery veggies, I notice a little cube in the sauce. After some inspection, it is definitely tofu. I say fuck it, and try it. 

Tofu is weird. Why do people like it?

I start to feel a little weird at the end of the meal, and couldn't finish. Already feeling uncomfortable, since I always finish meals, and on top of that I'm stoned, we head out after paying bills. Walking around downtown, I could feel the all too familiar signs of lame ass allergies. 

Since our meal took so long, I missed the ride back with the profs. The feeling in my throat, the cold sweats, and wooziness told me that water was necessary. However, I'm not 21, and like hell I'm losing my fake in a city that isn't even the one I live in. I try to play it cool, since I don't really know most of the group, and puking in front of acquaintances is pretty awkward. I end up walking out of the store to get some air, and end up puking in a trashcan. 

So, I feel a little better, and I'm trying to psych myself up to not fuck up. Just kidding says my body, and I have to alert the group as they are walking away that I am a conscious slime machine at this point. They were kind of concerned, but I told them I was better. 

Ha. I start dry heaving the second I smell anything, and have to chill in the bushes for a while so I wouldn't puke on anything important. So I have to catch a taxi, and luckily the nicest guy was driving and no one else was on board. I tell him whats up with the address and why I'll be dry heaving and puking out the window and he's real cool about it. I successfully vomited out a couple times, and then one caught me by surprise and it ended up streaked along the outside of the van. The bill was 21 and I gave him the rest of my money because I'm pretty sure he noticed and didn't mention it. 

So I stumble up to my room and take the grossest, bloodiest shit ever. I was desperate for water, but dammit if there are no cups in the hotel bathroom (the fuck). Shoveling water into my hand, I then collapse into the bed. My roomie comes in, and as soon as I wake up, the urge to shit comes again. Cue this about three more times before I finally fall asleep.

I awoke at three am to find a fart that wasn't really just a fart. I am so happy my mom raised me well, and to always bring clean underwear, because I would have just been miserable. 

After I plop back into bed, that pre-cramp feel appears in my left foot. I stretch the muscle to keep the cramp away. This, however, cramps the shin muscle(?) that I have to flex to ward off the foot cramp. Instinctively, I release it, which then causes the foot the cramp. My writhing then caused my knee to cramp. I see where the little plastic cups are and hobble back to the sink to hydrate myself. Commence sleep.

Today was a lot of walking around gardens with no bathrooms, while still trying to act like a normal person whose stomach is not fighting a winning battle against their anus. I didn't get to shit until the very end at the Biltmore Estate, so at least it was classy-ish. 

Finally made it home, and am never eating tofu again.

I notice a drip-drip-drip in the bathtub but I figure it's just the normal water dripping from the tap. I flush and pull back the curtain to turn off the water and stop the dripping-A WILD NAKED RUSSIAN APPEARS!

Stan is sitting in the bathtub which is half-full of water, looking up at me with an annoyed expression on his face, shampoo suds in his hair. I wish I could say the majority of him was submerged, but it wasn't, and the water was pretty clear anyway.

ShotzInTheDark,20,13,1ookzh,50,"It's been a rough couple of weeks, Reddit. I fucked up majorly last week and the beginning of this one with a lie I told before we were even engaged - one from right when we began dating. I perpetuated this lie for years. Then, I got caught, and came out with all the details of the lie, how it had evolved to include other intricacies and more lies - all to keep that first lie alive. It was a whopper. I still can't believe I'm capable of the level of scum-bagginess my lies represent. 

Then comes today. 

She took her ring off days ago, maybe last week. Said she didn't know who I was right now, and needed to have her head clear to think - looking down at the ring I designed from the band to the stones (and the matching wedding band, also designed by me) clouded her thoughts. She's perfectly within her right to do so; I fucked up - big. She's still with me, so I have that going for me, which is nice. 

I've carried them with me; never letting them leave my side. Hoping to soon earn back a small spit of trust; enough so that she's willing to work through my lies as husband and wife. 

Today I went back to work (furloughed Fed). I left her a cute note in the kitchen since she was still asleep when I left. I laid the wedding band on top of the note; stating ""with this ring, I thee wed. I'm carrying the other one with me still, yearning to earn back the right to put it on your finger. Love you."" 

Then I placed the engagement ring in my suit pocket, and off to work. 

I fondled it in my pocket a bit on the drive in, and over a cup of coffee. Reminding myself how lucky of an asshole I am to have this gal, and how badly I fucked up her trust in me. I have no right to have her trust me, but I want nothing more. 

Then, my day picked up. Things got hectic as the mighty wheels of government ""progress"" spun back up. ~2ish PM, I reach into my pocket to feel the ring - no ring. Fuck. I retraced all of my steps, every office I went to, every hallway I walked. Talk to everyone I could at every place I'd been - The coffee shop I walked to this morning, the sandwich joint where I got lunch, every single receptionist desk in every building between those two destinations and my office. Nothing. Fuck. 

Then, time to come home. Fuck. 

Have to tell her. Fuck. She has to hear it NOW. Fuck. She has to hear it from me, right now. Fuck. 

I told her. Fuck. She's been super supportive - working with me now to E-mail any and all pawn shops in the area .. Tomorrow I beat feet again; burning some personal time to hunt this thing down. 

If you come across a ring the the D.C, Metro area, Diamond IGI # is laserscribed on the stone itself, can be seen under microscope), you'd make my goddamn currently fucked up day if you contacted me.

edmismylife,15,10,1onve4,55,"I guess I'll start off by giving some context here.  I'm a Sophomore Electrical Engineering student in a relatively rigorous program.  Being that it's the middle of the fall, midterms have been popping up.  On Wednesday I had a Physics midterm which I studied religiously for and nailed.  It was a huge sigh of relief because it's the hardest class for me.  I have pretty severe ADHD, so it's really hard to stay focused and study for exams.  I felt proud and happy that I was able to pull it off, and rode that wave of studiousness that Wednesday night to join a study group run by my Circuits professor to knock out my homework quickly and accurately (which I did, which once again made me feel good).

Enter Differential Equations and Linear Algebra, stage left.  You see, every week we have a minor quiz on Thursdays just to check up on how we are doing with the material/make sure we are doing the homework.  Whenever this quiz is administered, my Diff Eq professor gives a short lecture first and then gives us the quiz.  So today, I'm running a bit late (no biggie, right?) and figure I'm just gonna slide in the back, catch the lecture, and bang out the quiz.  **WRONG**.

When I walk in I see everyone is working on a quiz.  Okay, no panic, I'll just move quickly as I was only ten minutes late.  That's when I get handed the quiz and I happen to notice the title was not ""Quiz &lt;Insert Quiz Number Here&gt;"", but rather EXAM.  That's right, it was the midterm exam and I had fucking forgotten entirely.  And, to make things even better, since there was no more seat space I had to sit up at the table the professor normally stands by while giving the lecture.  Which meant I had the entire class watching me (at least somewhat) AND I had the professor standing behind me looking over my shoulder.

I gave it my best shot, but I had to leave 80% of the problems blank because I didn't even know where to begin.  I'm totally fucked, Reddit.  I sheepishly handed in the Exam to him early (because what else was I gonna do, pretend to think?) and asked him when he would be in his office tomorrow (time to beg for my grade).  I'm hoping and praying that he'll be merciful and at least let me take the other version of the exam (there are two to prevent peeking/cheating) for diminished credit.  I'm going to try and explain the situation to him, and he seems friendly enough, but if this doesn't work my GPA is gonna be dragged down so hard by this class.  I already wasn't doing great (I think I was in the 78 range), and if I don't get credit this midterm is going to pull it down so far.

aaaaarg,8,2,1omt5w,10,"**TLDR: Crashed a friend's car, foot the bill. Insure your cars people**


It happened yesterday, actually.


I borrowed a friend's car for the day. The owner then went to class. On the way, I picked up two others. There's two options to get from where I am to my destination: the highway or the back roads. The highway is faster, so naturally I went for it.


The traffic on that day was a somewhat dense. I maintained a safe distance to the car in front of me, kept left when possible, check my mirrors before switching lanes, used indicators, the whole lot. A few minutes in, the traffic began to pile. I saw the other lane is a bit empty, so I checked my mirrors and indicated. Keep in mind that the car in front of me before I switched lane was something like 3-4 cars' ahead.


Then my friend said ""watch out."" I looked forward. The fuck? The car has stopped already? Shit. Better man the brakes at full blast. I panicked (which I don't usually do when I'm driving). 2 cars' length was something like 20 or so meters. At 60km/h, a Nissan March *should* be able to stop dead. But not that day. In my panic, I didn't manage to shift down a few gears. Engine brake could help a bit. But no.


And the inevitable happened. Bumper to bumper collision. Engine bonnet twisted. Bumper hanging. The front end was a mess.


Long story short, the owner's brother showed up, inspected the damage, and told me to see his dad. So I went.


At the dad's place, all hell broke loose for me and the owner friend. He demanded that I fix both cars. No ifs and buts. He told me he wanted to speak with my parents. I called them.


My dad called me this morning. He said that he will foot the bill, providing my two mates would foot part of it as well. Still, a bit of light in the hour of darkness.

I was pretty tired, but I could deal with it. I was going to just take a nap for a few hours, It was 6:30 in the morning, and I didn't have school until 11:30 AM. 

I crawl into bed, and, knowing myself, I wake up every few hours to readjust. I would set my watch to beep, but I felt that, for sure, I would have woken up. On days like this, my parents call me to make sure I don't sleep through it, anyway. I close my eyes and fall sleep very quickly.

I wake up, and after moving around a bit and unswaddling myself from the blankets, I suddenly notice that it is dark. ""Oh fuck, what time is it?"" I fumble with the button on my watch that activates the backlight. I finally press it.

Chief prefers that we tuck the brim of the cover into the back of our waistband.

I had just shown up for work. There was a little abdominal grumbling, but nothing, I thought, that couldn't wait. We gathered in ranks, then our superiors started to give out information.

Reddit, I hate cooking. The fact that we need to eat to survive is something I view as an inconvenience. If science could develop some sort of tablet that provided us with all our needed nutrients and calories I would be a happy camper. As such, easy recipes are a must. 

Enter the crock pot.

It took me six years of living on my own (parents never used one growing up) to discover the possibilities, but once I did, I was hooked. Just pile some meat and veggies into that sumbitch, go to sleep, and have meals for days. Fuck. Yes.

What I'm assuming happened (I don't exactly remember) is this:

It's Monday morning. I'm running late for work. I shovel some crock pot-y goodness into a tupperware container for lunch and dump the rest into another for the days to come. I put the lid back on my pot and go.

My week is busy. I work full time and do quite a bit of volunteering on the side. Maybe I came home Monday night and said, ""I'll clean you tomorrow, crock pot."" 

But tomorrow never came. The crock pot disappeared into the corner of my counter, obscured by newly purchased bottles of wine. I tired of my diet of slow cooked meals and regressed to my old habits of baking things in my toaster oven and putting avocado on them. The pot was forgotten. 

Fast forward to today (what I'm approximating to be six weeks or so later). I'm leaving for work, running late, as usual. The crock pot catches the corner of my eye. A knot forms in my stomach as the reality of the situation hits me. I peer into its depths and gasp at the landscape before me.

The walls are covered by a soft coating of blue mold, cascading down into a congealed mass of brain tissue-esque fungi. A brown, syrupy sheen reflects off the crock pot floor. Overcome by anger, regret, and horror, I leave for work, vowing to slay the beast when I come home.

It haunted me, TIFU. I couldn't get the image out of my mind. For nine hours of work and one hour of spin class I considered my plan of attack.  

As I pulled up to my apartment, I was ready. As fate would have it, I work in a tuberculosis clinic. Like many infectious disease professionals, I carry an N95 mask in my bag. (N95 masks are designed to filter out 95% of small particles in the air.) I strapped it on and stuck a tea bag in there for good measure (it helps with the smell). My cat looked on in horror as I donned my rubber gloves. 

I removed the lid and let the crock pot fill with hot water. The congealed mass of mold floated to the top and slipped out. As I leaned over my sink to poke it down the drain the smell hit me. I took a step back and let the tea bag do its job. Once the aroma of green ginger tea had cancelled out the month old vomit like stench of god knows what, I returned to my task. 

The pot now sits in my sink, soaking in a bath of dish soap and water. My kitchen is coated in a fine mist of Febreze, and my cat does not understand why we are not playing laser pointer. So, I'll end my story here, and hope to christ that I don't let anything in my kitchen get that fucking disgusting ever again.

Well there is a bad problem with people letting their cats roam about and they will climb into his jeep and piss all over the seats. My boss sets a trap up every night with cat food and we trap a cat every few days and call the animal shelter to come pick it up. Well today I was going to be driving to near the animal shelter on my route around town checking stuff out, so I just said I'd take the cat with me. It was actually a pretty cute little Siamese kitten, probably around 10 weeks old. I loaded it up in the bed of the pickup and drove off. It was coldish outside, about 50 degrees and the cat was meowing and shivering so I felt bad for it. I made him a pallet in the passenger floor board and took him out of the cage and let him sit there.

After about 2 minutes of driving the kitten got up and found that the truck had a tiny opening allowing the cat to crawl into the dash. I pull over and start trying to look for it, it was no where to be found, the entry curved and there was no telling where it had crawled to. So I start to kind of panic thinking ""Oh shit the kitten is going to get lost or caught up in the dash and die, and my boss is going to be pissed that the work truck reeks of dead animal."" I kept on going around town doing what I needed to do, occasionally I'd hear a meow coming from the dash. Eventually I saw a paw stick out of a crack near the glove box about 3 inches where the kitten had gone it. I looked under it and saw him, but he was perched on top of all kinds of wires so I couldn't get him down.

I finally made it to the shelter and asked if they could give me a can of cat food to bait him out. I got in and set it in the floor board and continued on. After 5 minutes the kitten had came out of the dash and is in the floorboard, but he is uninterested in the food. I pulled over the truck on the side of the highway to grab the kitten.

I could have gone after him and caught him, but the field was muddy and at the time I thought the dumbass cat made his own bed.

Somehow I managed to knock the kettle over and causing it to spill all over my leg that is now burned pretty hard. Rushed upstairs to the shower so I could let some cold water stream over it, turned on the wrong tap and got a nice potion of steaming hot water over my already burned leg. So at this point I wouldn't mind if you would come to kill me.

So today I finishing up loading her truck and I walk into the office as she's walking out and I playfully grab her hat and started to walk away. I was about to turn around to give her hat back and she had grabbed me by the good and held my head down like a hockey player would. I give her back her hat and requested to one of my bosses to have me leave(which I was already doing). Anyways I apologize and she just shrugs it off. Half hour later I get a call from my main boss asking what happened and I told him. Then he asked me if I had made derogatory remarks to her, I said yes but in play. Then he asked if I had made any sexual remarks to her and I also said yes but in play. I also mentioned to him that she had asked me personally to stop with the derogatory and sexual comments because I had gone to far and she was starting to get offended.

Remalaptar,18,7,1okhkw,45,"2 weeks ago I proposed to my girlfriend (for the sake of this TIFU, her name will be Sam) on vacation.  She said yes.  She’s only human.

When we got back from said vacation, there was a distinct lack of messages of congratulations from her friends.  I thought that was odd but put it down to them wanting to congratulate her in person.  Several days came and went and still nothing.  

There were plans made for her to meet up with her girlfriends one Tuesday evening, but that was cancelled due to a suspicious amount of contradictory excuses.  In the end, Sam decided to go round the house of her best friend (lets call her Kay) one night after work to say hello and catch up.  She went round, came back an hour or so later annoyed/upset as at no point whilst she was there did Kay even mention the engagement.  She put this down to a combination of silly female jealousy and a slight fallout she had with one of her friends on her birthday night out (where the friend, with a history of eating problems, apparently intentionally overate and thus complained of stomach cramps with the intent to go home).  Her decision was to let sleeping dogs lie and wait it out.  They have spats like this all the time, and usually after a few days or even weeks everyone forgets the issue and are friends again.

Unfortunately, I didn't see it that way. 

This was meant to be the happiest news of her life so far, and not a single one of her close friends had so much as bothered to send a text message.  I lost it, picked up my phone and wrote a message to the two friends in my phonebook:  Kay and another who for a reason which is beyond me is looked upon as some great icon within the group, despite having the emotional mindset of a 5 year old.  Let’s call her Jane.

I saw red and I began to type.  “Call yourself ‘friends’?”  I said, “This is meant to be the happiest news and you can’t even be bothered to send a text” I continued, gathering more and more vicious, toxic steam.  I accused Kay of being manipulated by Jane because for whatever reason she had decided that Sam had to be punished.  In my text to Jane, I sarcastically congratulated her, saying, “Well done, you’ve got what you wanted: [fiancé] is devastated”.  I could continue, but I can’t fully remember what else I said.  Rest assured, it was pure bile.

I sent the texts, somehow convincing myself that upon reading them, Kay and Jane would suddenly realise they are acting like children and get in touch with Sam and everything will be fixed.

Nope.

Not five minutes later there was a bang at the door.  It was Kay.  Shaking, crying and furious with anger at what I said to her.  It was now that I was starting to realise that my message probably wasn’t the most sensible of actions, especially as she said nobody had done anything because they were planning a surprise party that Sunday (something which I am still convinced was a lie).  After a lot of shouting, Kay went home and Sam spoke to Jane on the phone.  Believe it or not, she wasn’t best pleased with the message she received either.  It was during that conversation that something came up that I didn’t expect: everything negative that I said would only have been a result of stuff that Sam had told me.  So now not only was I public enemy #1 for saying that, but Sam was equally as hated as they think she has been badmouthing them in private (I didn’t want to comment on the blatant hypocrisy as they all do it).

So yeah.  It’s been 9 days since I sent the messages.  Sam hasn’t had any contact with any of her close circle of friends since that night, and the general consensus is that isn’t going to be changing any time soon.  

TL:DR Sent aggressive and hateful text message to fiance’s friends, very likely ruining her friendship with all of them.

I normally use a demo account to test my software, and during this testing, I purchase / sell hundreds of stocks a minute. The software is 99.99% finished, the client has already paid me. He asked for some last minute adjustments, and I was working on them.

In the middle of this, I was having an issue, so I decided to try it with the 2nd trading program which was installed on my testing computer. Not knowing / remembering that this 2nd program was set up with my client's live account rather than a demo, because a couple weeks ago the client had logged onto this computer to do something, and then had left his main account logged in.

So I fired up the program and began my testing, and executed god knows how many trades in a few minutes. Suddenly, I got a call where I got told to immediately stop whatever I was doing. So I looked, and noticed that it was logged into the live account rather than demo..

And its kind of a two parter.

Ok so yesterday me and a friend are hanging out at the cafeteria at my college before class. This particular class is boring as fuck. This past weekend I went to a party and had leftover alcohol. You can see where this is going. 

I go over to a vending machine and get a coke and drink half of it while I walk to my car (the stuff is in the trunk) and pour myself a very, very strong (75% rum, 25% coke) mixed drink and proceed to drink it really fast right before and during class. I finish it around 15 minutes into class (had started right as class began) and it hit me hard. I wasn't completely annihilated but was very noticeably drunk.

So I cranked out a specific resume tailored to this particular job posting and actually remembered to attach it to the email. Really polished that sucker and embellished the bullet points that the employer was looking for, I mean really *nailed* the resume.

Then promptly send it not from my 'normal' email but from my novelty email, that I use to sign up for shit like Pizza Hut emails promotions and video games: essentially it's *chokeonmygiantchodefucker@hotmail.com*. That's not it exactly but you get the gist.

lliinnddsseeyy,4,12,1oge36,37,"It was lunch time. I wanted a sandwich. My family rarely has lunch meat in the house (because they hate me, I guess? I don't know what kind of people don't have copious amounts of varying types of lunch meat), but today when I opened the fridge I saw an opened package of ham with *one* slice left. So I'm thinking ""Damn! This is my lucky day! I don't have to eat just measly bread and cheese!"" 

Then I realize that this meat is a little bit more dark and dry than the sliced ham I have eaten in the past. I weigh the options in my head- either it's bad, and I run the chance of getting sick, or it's totally fine and it's probably just the light and man who the fuck cares because I get to have a sandwich with MEAT on it! 

It was a tough choice, as you can tell. 

So I slap my sammy together, wrassle up some chips on the side, get myself a cup of apple juice, and proceed to masticate. 

Fast forward to dinner time: I'm feeling way more tired than normal, and I can barely keep my eyes open. For some reason the pasta that I normally love is just not interesting my stomach today, who seems to have had enough food to last a lifetime, based on how loudly it is complaining. I excuse myself and go to bed, slightly worried about my lunchtime choice. 

12:24 AM: I wake up in a cold sweat. I have to make a quarter of a split-second decision- Am I going to throw up out my window (three feet away), or try to make it to the bathroom (at least 25 feet away)? I choose window, but I choose just slightly too late, and as I frantically struggle to open it, the first wave of dinner is unleashed on my floor, windowsill, window, and curtains. I want to yell ""Fuck!"" but I know that if I open my mouth, words will not be the only thing to come out. I get the window open, and I have to walk through my own vomit to get out to the balcony, where a damn *torrential rain* of vomit is let loose onto the patio below. I mean at least five or six waves, it felt like I was losing four times the volume of my stomach, which was impressive considering how little I had eaten for dinner. 

Finally it was over, and then I got to go back inside and spend the next half hour cleaning up my own noodle barf. To top it all off, I completely forgot to drink water afterwards, so I woke up feeling like I was dying all over again.

I was heading to the ""Zombie Walk""  with my friends, which is a gathering of people dressed like zombies with games, food, etc. While on campus I saw a guy with wispy white hair, sunken in eyes, wearing all black. He was walking slowly and crookedly, with his head drifting to the side, both arms bent, shuffling along. Best zombie walk I have ever seen! 

I enthusiastically yelled ""YEAAAAAHHH!!!!!"" loudly, cheering him for his dedication for being in character as a zombie the whole day. 

Instantly, my friends and about 10 other strangers stared at me  as if I was convicted for drowning puppies. 

Confused, I said, ""What? He's a ZOMBIE!"" very happily and smiling. I was thoroughly convinced he was acting as a zombie, and was on his way to the festivities!

 As we walked, I saw him closer and realized he was an elderly man, with some sort of handicap making it hard for him to walk. Realizing this, I felt absolutely awful and hung my head down in shame, as my frienda slowly inched themselves away from me. Spent the rest of the walk realizing how I am definitely going to hell.

Raiden_Gekkou,26,32,1of8vq,16,"Back in the second grade, instead of paying a lot of money for me to go to a professional sitter service, my parents found a woman nearby who would watch me for a lot less. There were some other kids there, but since I went there from evening until after dark, it was mostly just me, the sitter's daughter Amiri, and her little brother. After bedtime, I would sleep on an inflatable mattress on the floor until my mom came to get me.

One night, the Amiri asked me if I wanted to know a secret, and me, being the age that I was, couldn't resist. She told me that sometimes she can see her parents doing stuff naked in their bedroom because they usually wouldn't close their door all the way, and that she wanted to try it with me because it sounded like they were having fun. I had no idea what sex was at this age, but as a kid I thought that if grownups were having fun doing naked stuff, maybe I would too. So I agreed, and she told me to take my clothes off. I was a little unsure about it, but she undressed first and told me it would be fun. We couldn't turn the lights on because her mom would know that we were up when we were supposed to be sleeping, so after we were both naked, lots of awkward fondling went on because we didn't get night vision goggles for Christmas.

After a bit of this, Amiri laid on her back and told me to put my thingy in hers. It was still dark, I had no idea how a vagina looked or functioned, and I had never played with my dong before, so it really didn't work out. Just a lot of me trying to stick my wiener somewhere and not having much fun, although being naked in someone else's house was a plus. Seeing as how this was going nowhere, she got into the doggystyle position and told me that her parents did it like this too, so maybe it would work. And work it did. I didn't know what this feeling was back then, but we liked it. I remember how sometimes her little brother would wake up and ask if he could do it with her, and she'd always tell him that he wasn't old enough yet so his thing wouldn't fit. I didn't think that was weird then, but it makes me wonder about them now.

I'm not sure how long this went on for, but one night I guess we were talking too loud. We hear her mom walking up the hallway so we duck under the covers. This wasn't really a good idea, since I slept on the inflatable mattress that we'd have sex on, and Amiri had her own bed, but little kids don't always think shit through. Her mom comes in and knows that we're awake, so she pulls the covers back to find us both naked together. She didn't seem as mad about us being naked under the covers as she did about us being up late making noise, since we still had school in the morning. A little after she went back to her room and we put our clothes back on, my mom came to pick me up, and I could Amiri's mom tell my mom about us being naked under the covers together. I had the biggest pit in my stomach. Like the pit of despair that Kristen Stewart must've been in for her to never smile in that awful vampire movie. Not only did I get caught not following the rules, but I got caught doing naked adult stuff. I thought my mom was going to tear my ass to pieces with the belt. So I get my stuff and walk past her with my head down to the car and hop in. Luckily I was too young for ""the talk"", so on the way home, my mom just told me to stop misbehaving and obey the babysitter, and she never mentioned it again. I felt like I dodged a bullet, and by bullet I mean ""belt whooping my ass.""

Long story short I ended up going over there and we had sex. Next morning she thanked me and told me that it had been a long time since she had had sex to which I ask the STUPID question that I think might have been the worst thing that I could have said ""This isn't going to make things awkward between us, is it?"" and got the response ""no"" nothing more nothing less.

I vaguely felt the need to pee, but I figured it could wait until I got more important stuff done first. I laid out my usual set up, a stack of paper towels placed on my desk in front of my keyboard. I have done this set-up many times before, and never once had a spill. Now, normally I fap with the intention of finishing quickly. Today, however, I decided to try a slower style, with the intention of drawing out the finish for a few additional and magnificent seconds of orgasm. Worst mistake ever. I found a fitting video, and, when I approached the end, began to slow down and relax. This already felt pretty good, so I relaxed even more, only to have urine suddenly start shooting out of my erect dick.

StormyDavis,3,6,1oedqf,17,"This past weekend was my college's fall break, a long-weekend where a lot of students go home. I returned to my hometown to visit my family and see some of my friends who still live there. My buddy Dan's parents were leaving Saturday night and wouldn't be back until Sunday, so naturally we decided to get incredibly drunk at his open house. We bought two 24 cases of Yuengling, and a 30 rack of PBR to share between 10 people. My friend James also brought the remnants of a bottle of Kraken rum he had acquired through a trade for Mischief Brew tickets (ironically he traded the tickets for the rum because he found out it was a 21+ show). Needless to say, we got all kinds of fucked up and I blacked out.

After drinking 11 beers and sharing a joint or two, my brother (sober) picks me up at around 1:30 and takes me back home. I was pretty beat from the hell I had just put my liver through, so I quickly ditched my jeans for some athletic shorts (commando, obviously) and went right to bed. It was much like any other night of drunken debauchery, except something strange happened: I dreamt. When I get this intoxicated I usually just pass out and the next thing I know it's morning, so this was really out of the ordinary. The dream was surprisingly realistic, albeit quite fuzzy, and from what I remember it involved me going up to my desk and taking a piss into a plastic container where I store various odds and ends. It was peculiar, but I didn't really think about it much when I woke up and carried on my day normally.

It was only when I was packing my things to go back to school and started gathering things from my desk several hours later that I realized this was no dream. My mind was racing as I saw my buttons, several origami sculptures, and guitar picks swimming in a shallow, stagnant sea of my own urine. I quickly began rinsing whatever could be saved from the bin and cleaning it vigorously. However, several origami sculptures were drenched in piss and could not be saved. Now, one could say that this was just a simple drunkard move, that my inebriated logic valued my need to piss into some sort of receptacle over the value of the objects in the plastic container. However, my room is connected to a bathroom, and I was a mere 3 feet from a perfectly fine toilet that did not contain things I sort of cared about.

I have spent the entire day desperately trying to figure out a motive for my drunk actions. Why did I destroy my own possessions when there was a functioning toilet so close by? The only conclusion I have come to is that my drunk-self is a malicious, piss-happy bastard who hates origami. Today I am bearing his cross with the massive hangover he has given me.

His mother and I have paid for his food, clothes, car, and most importantly SCHOOL even after he turned 18. He has never taken an ounce of responsibility for his own well-being, and wastes most of his time drinking and playing in his shitty cover band. Well, last night he informed me that he was going to be dropping out of school. Several weeks too late to be refunded for any of the semester. Needless to say, my wife and I were furious. Throughout all of the things I've put up with from my son, his willingness to obtain an education has always been the saving grace that has kept me from throwing him out on his ass. But I held composure, and he remains in our care. So today, my son decided that he was going to hang out with some of his friends and celebrate his newfound freedom from what responsibility he had. Now, our dog is a Great Dane, and is rather fond of his room. While she has certainly given us less trouble than our useless son, she does from time to time have accidents in the house. I had off from work today, and so while my son was out and my wife was at work I took it upon myself to take a shit in his (unmade) bed. I also made a point to piss on a pile of his clothes, just for good measure. After the deed was done, I relaxed and watched TV while I waited for my son to come home. By the time he found his way back to the house, my wife was already home. When he walked into his room, the results were at first predictable. A slew of expletives alerted me that he had found the surprises I left for him. It was very hard not to laugh, but I managed to keep control of myself. When I got to his room, my wife was already there, with a concerned look on her face. It was then that I noticed the feces I had left on my son's bed was thoroughly streaked with blood. In addition, a modest amount of blood stained the sheets around it. Not being a man who looks at my own shit, I had failed to see that I had been laying blood covered brown eggs on my son's bed. So now the dog has a vet appointment, and my wife is very worried. She absolutely loves that dog.

AaronSarm,80,185,1ocy31,215,"Yesterday we went to a swingers party at a friend's house.  The whole afternoon was filled with naked swimming and soaking in the hot tub.  Lots of drinking as well.  So, as it got darker and we got drunker, things turned more sexual.  My gf and I were sitting in the hot tub with three other couples, one of whom were our good friends (John and Jane) that we've never ""played"" with, but have hung out with at several parties.  Jane and I dance together at parties and I've played with her boobs and we've kissed some, but that's it.  My girl friend got up to go pee and John and Jane were making out across from me.  Jane's leg was sort of laying across mine, so I was stroking it while she and John were messing around.  She gave John and blowjob and then turned to me.  Needless to say, my girlfriend walked up on us and flipped out.  Now we can never hang out with John and Jane again, which is sad, because I really enjoyed them.  My girlfriend blames her for everything, even though I explained that Jane asked me if my girl friend would be okay with it, and my alcohol-dulled, sexually aroused man logic figured it wasn't that big of a deal.


EDIT: Okay so I'm just going to answer some of the questions here instead of replying to each comment. I'm also going to give my gf a name: Jill.  We've been together for four years and have been swinging during that whole time just about.  It was a new experience for both of us.  We are unofficially engaged (i.e. no ring).  We have done everything there is to do as swingers, fully swapping in different rooms on numerous occasions, though we both agree it is more fun to do it together in the same room.  Our one stated rule, up until now, was that we always swing together, which means that we don't go to parties single and we don't sneak off while at the party with other people.  In my mind, because it was in front of John and in the tub in the common area, it would be okay.  Also there was a similar but reversed incident at another party that made me feel like it was okay to continue without her.  At another party there was a whole group of us that made plans for one of the bedrooms, but I had to go pee.  By the time I got to the bedroom everyone was in full swing including her, and I just joined right in.  It was no big deal.

As someone mentioned, sometimes one member of a swinging couple will not like certain people and set them off  limits for their SO, and that's fine.  Jill said that she felt betrayed by Jane because John and Jane had always presented themselves as mainly/only looking for bisexual women for Jane to play with.  Jill is straight, so that's why we had never done anything with them other than flirt and dance.  In dancing and playing around with Jane, I had concluded that Jane also wanted men (she certainly acted like she wanted me), but that John may have been reticent about full swap.  I had shared those thoughts with Jill before because of the way Jane had acted towards me.  I guess Jill did not believe me.

The real ball gnawer here is that after everything went down last night, Jill told me she had planned to make out with Jane in the hot tub that night and possibly some of the other women until I fucked it up.  I would totally give the incomplete blow job back for that. ",TIFU by agreeing to a blowjob while my gf went to pee.,400

She warned us that this sink could get to be 120 degrees farenheight, which set my twisted mind rolling.

So I've been recovering from food poisoning for the past couple of days and I'm an avid rock climber so I haven't really been able climb recently because of this...

Yesterday, I thought what the hell I'll try it out.  I've been slowly getting my appetite back so I had breakfast and lunch so I thought I was all good.  WRONG.  I decided I should have a burrito with beans and extra hot sauce later that day, probably about an hour before rock climbing.

I'm feeling good, I'm feeling great.  I can't wait to climb.  I head into the place, scan my card, lock up my bike on the bike rack, put my clothes in the locker, put on my climbing shoes, put my gear on, get a random partner to climb with because I went by myself... and now I am ready to go.

My partner was a pretty cute chick as well.  Very positive girl and very excited to climb.  We rock paper scissored to see who wanted to climb first.  I won.

I'm getting ready to go and I take my first step on the wall.  ....But... something doesn't feel right.  I'm about 7 feet off the ground at this point and instead of going to the bathroom just incase I need to poop, I stayed climbing.  Now probably about 15 feet off the ground, make the 20, make that 30, 35, 40, now about 45 feet in the air I make it to the top.

As I rang the bell at the top I had a sudden urge to fart.  I said fuck it, and I did. 

I sharted.  I can feel shit running down my leg. I'm 45 feet in the air shit in my shorts.  I feel another strong feeling coming from my stomach and there's no way I can hold it.  I shit my pants.  I shit my fucking pants. 

BUT WHY IS POOP RUNNING DOWN MY SHORTS... POOP SHOULD NOT EXIT MY SHORTS 45 FEET IN THE AIR.

This is the part where I could not believe what happened.  I will never forget this.  This actually happened.

The poop landed on her fucking face.  I have never heard such a horrible scream in my entire life.  I look down and she screaming like crazy, with poop on her face, and her holding me up by the rope. She doesn't know what to do because I'm in the air and she also has shit on her face.  

She starts puking because of the smell, meanwhile this is happening theres like 60+ people in the building, people are laughing, taking videos, and freaking out because of the smell. She's fucking screaming at me and calling me names.

I kept yelling at her that I need to get down If I don't want shit to keep dripping from mid air.  She finally let me down.  And my god, up close and personal with this gorgeous blonde, but now with shit on her face and puke on the ground.  She ran straight to the showers...

EVERYONE IS FUCKING STARING AT ME AT THIS POINT.  I have no idea what to do.

My first reaction? Run the fuck out of there and never come back.  And I did do just that.

Right when I left the place, I realized, fuck, my wallet, my keys, my bike, my phone, and all my shit is in my locker.  I said fuck it I'll get it tomorrow.  I walked home with shit in my pants and my roommate buzzed me in.  

So in about 30 minutes I'm going back over there to get all my stuff.  I have super long hair so I plan on shaving it before I go so I don't get recognized.  This was the worst day of my entire life.

The van gets off free but I ram my car into her bumper. My front of the car is totalled and I can't start the engine. It was rush hour. I called the cops. My car gets towed. The cop was nice but gives me a ticket because I was following too close. It's fine, it was just $110. My car is totalled, not worth fixing. It was probably worth around 3 grand anyway. Tow truck driver was nice. He told me in a thick Russian accent to fight the ticket so that I can avoid the points.

I missed the first few of hours of work. I get into work at 10am. I got a rental that was paid by insurance and went into work anyway. My boss was nice and gave me time to step away to call my insurance. My colleagues help me suggest new cars to get.

That isn't going to get me a decent enough car, not for all the mileage I put in my car. And this vacation is costing me 5 grand, I haven't paid back my friend for half of it yet.

Worst part is that my dad is the primary on the insurance. He has to be whom the claim goes to even though I paid for the car and pay monthly for insurance. So I had to come clean to him. I told him it wasn't my fault to keep him from nagging me to death, after all I was leaving tomorrow. I'll face the music when I come back.

I am surprisingly okay despite the accident. I was looking to get a new car anyway, might as well get one sooner than later. I guess I have to finance the rest.

boardgamejoe,38,6,1o36cn,53,"The event happened last Thursday but the aftermath happened this morning.

I work at a factory, and we have various machines and a couple of them are run by these old Windows XP computers. On Wednesday of last week, one of these testing machines was not working, and after 5 hours of downtime, they finally realized that this memory card that records data was full and needed to be changed out. This is the second time this has happened, and no one seems to ever remember to check the memory card.

So I am pretty computer savvy, I am not a programmer, but I build and maintain my own systems and I am fairly confident in any windows environment.

So I am working at my station, and I was looking at the plain black wallpaper on that computer and it occurred to me that I could open up MS Paint, make a black PNG, add in some text that said ""Is the memory card full?"" at the bottom of the screen in white letters and MAYBE it would save us some trouble next time.

So I did it, and I even showed it to our group leader thinking that they would see that it was a helpful idea.

Boy, was I ever wrong. A few minutes later the supervisor for the maintenance department is screaming at me to never EVER touch the computers ever again! and then another supervisor (Who does NOT like me to begin with, and is known for trying to get people fired) walks up and he takes a picture of the screen with his iPhone and I ask ""What's that for?"" and he says ""An example.""

So he walks off, and I go to him again and ask ""Is that done with? I said I understood my mistake, have already been chewed out for it. Do you plan on taking this further?"" and he goes, ""We'll see.""

Ominous

Well I am piss scared, I really need my job.

So I hang out a few minutes after work and I want to talk to a bigger boss who seems a fair and decent sort and before I get to talk with him, the supervisor who took the picture talked to him about it first.
So I wait until he is finished and walking away and I approach him and ask if he has a minute and he says he already heard about it, and just told me to stay off the computers and don't do it again but not to worry about it.

I was relived, feeling that the danger had passed. The next day, I was at the computer near the group leader because I had some missing hours on a check and I see the group leader's email open and I see an email that says ATTN:BoardGameJoe 

and I ask, ""Hey.. what is that about?"" and she says ""Why are you reading my emails??"" and I said ""I wasn't reading your emails, I just noticed my own name as it is easy to spot your own name.""

So she says ""Oh it's just this thing I had to fill out for HR"" and that's all she said.

Fuck, is this not over?
Is this a formality? or am I going to go all the way down for changing a fucking wallpaper?

Fast forward to today, I arrive at work and a few minutes later, i get told that I have to talk to the head of HR in the morning.

It was the most painful 7 hour wait that I have ever experienced. I was just sick with dread, could not eat or drink anything. Felt like throwing my guts up all night long. Spent the whole night trying to figure out what I was going to do to take care of my family.

What makes matters worse is that the company seems to be firing higher seniority people over trivial things and replacing them with temps or people with no seniority. People who are on the starting pay with no vacation days. My job is not highly specialized. I am just a miscellaneous line worker.

So the meeting came, they chewed me out pretty good, I was written up but somehow was allowed to keep my job.

So no big deal, we all hang out all the time and get to be pretty good friends where we go out and play basketball, volleyball, and just chill really. So last week, Molly comes up to me with her phone and asked me to put in my snapchat name. I think no big deal, all of us snapchat each other all the time, won't hurt anything. Well we start snapchatting and after about a day, she sent a random snapchat and all it said was text me. Well I decided I wasn't going to be the one to blame, so I have her my number and told her to text me first. So she did. Well that was last Thursday, and we texted on and off almost all weekend. So Sunday morning, she texted me and said that she needed to tell me something. So I ask what it is and she bullshits around it for a minute and finally just tells me that she likes me. I was in shock. But I did what any other guy would do and told her that she was cute (because both Molly and Sally are very attractive). So Monday afternoon, I was hanging out at Greg and Alex's apartment and I decided that it was the perfect day for a nap. Well I decide to go in Alex's room since Greg was napping in his own bed and Alex is at work. I lay down and fall asleep, and low and behold, about an hour later Molly walks in the door. Well I asked her if Greg knew she was there and she said no. So I told her we needed to talk about the whole situation about how it's fucked up on my part for me to do that to someone who is my good friend knowing that Greg likes Molly.

If I listen closely I can hear the gentle hum of the freeway a couple of blocks down. It's nice here. So nice, I decided to leave my window open the whole way for the night. It's been open since morning. But no big deal. I've done it before. But this time I didn't consider that the fact that it's warm.

It was about 11pm when I got into bed. I was browsing Reddit and doing a little programming on my ipad when I started to notice a couple of little black bugs lattracted to the light of my device. More than normal. I thought it was odd, but I dismissed it as nothing. A while later, I heard a sound to the right of me. It only took me a split second to realise what that sound was and about 2 seconds to fill me with dread.

Me and him worked together to try and kill Mr. Moth but he flew into the closet in amongst all of my clothes. Well shit. Now that thing is going to lay eggs in there. I gave up and just closed my closet so he could no longer provoke me. I decided it wasn't worth the effort anyway considering how much crap is in there. 

But just as I was heading to bed, I saw two of those little black bugs on the wall again. Then it hit me. I turned around to see hundreds of those microscopic black fucks having a party around my light. Which is no biggie. But, oh yeah. I REALLY hate bugs. I hurried to get some fly spray (thankfully I didn't stub my toe on the way, right?). And stood in my doorway trying to a) Hitler the crap out of all the bugs, and b) Trying not to  suffocate in the mist of the deadly fly spray for about half an hour. Oh yeah, and this was the fly spray that you have to shake to use... which is noisy. Which pisses your light sleeping parents off really badly. Dammit.

So now I'm sitting here on my ipad with my room smelling like chemicals (kinda like burning rubber for some reason), rubber bands and small dead bugs all over my roof and floor, some very pissed off parents and an extreme case of paranoia for any noise anywhere. I can't even sleep.

RoadZombie,5,3,1o1zwo,6,"My story starts out like this: *Back story* My mother who is an amazing person all around has struggled with depression all of her life, she had a terrible childhood, her mother never paid attention to her, she never found out who her real dad was because her mother slept around a lot and so their is a multitude of people that could potentially be her father. The one person that does decide to attempt to be a father in her life, her mom shuns and does not let around her as a kid.  Her mother then marries my now deceased step-grandfather, which I learned a couple years ago is a huge pile of shit who molested my mother as a kid.  Now my mother is one of 3 kids, one sister and a boy twin.  Neither of them were molested only her.  Her sister was also a complete bitch to my mom up until her early 20s, her brother on the other hand was her best-friend.  

Now lets fast forward 18 years, where I am now...18! My mom has been repressing this for the last 30 some odd years, however recently an incident at her work tipped her over the edge (incident was not her fault, shitty goddamn Human Resources) which has sent her down into a downward spiral for the past 4-5 months, along with the fact that she is now working another job where she works 65 hours a week and never gets to see me or my father.  

Now my Father is another story, we don't need much of a back story here, but between he has been really understanding of what has been happening with my mom, and is again a very good person.  However for the past 2 months of this downward spiral, my mother has not been coming home everynight after work.  Which worries the fuck out of my dad and myself.  My mom has been crying herself to sleep in her car, and sleeping in it some nights because she thinks she is a terrible piece of shit, which she isn't, no where near it.  Because of this my Father has manic depression, when he talks to my mom he is as happy as all get out but as soon as he hangs up he plunges into a depression because he doesn't know if my mom will be home that night.

Now this is where I am tied in, I am in the middle of all this, I can't sleep cause all i do is worry about my mom , or my father going off the deep end and its depressing me to a point where I don't sleep anymore, I can't sleep my mind races, I don't have the motivation to get out of bed cause all I do is worry anymore.  Now the real fuck up here is this all coincides with my first ever semester of college, and being the severely depressed person I am currently cause, in my mind, my home life is literally falling around me and I can't do a damn thing to stop it, I haven't been to college in weeks and I'm pretty sure I have fucked my first semester of college up to a point of no return and its no ones fault but mine, I should have gotten my ass up no matter what, but its just been so hard to fucking do anything.

This job takes a lot of memorization and organization, something which I often pride myself on. I had just gotten the hang of doing all the paperwork and driving the big fuel trucks and learning the different fuel points on the variety of aircraft when my 'incident' happened

Today we had three [KingAirs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_Super_King_Air) that were lined up next to each other on the ramp. Two were private charter aircraft and the one was a new medivac with no medical marking on it yet. I was by myself for this but had done these almost every day I worked here, ""no problem"" I thought

I started with the one on the right (my left) and filled it with full main tanks and 65L in the Aux tanks, done. The medivac always takes full main tanks so I moved down the line and filled up the tanks up to just over 400L. As I went to write down the reg. I noticed I had accidentally filled up the private charter plane. It had been fueled by my manager in the morning and I had inadvertently DOUBLED the fuel load of it.

spirit_llama,5,7,1ny6g3,36,"I, 22f, am studying abroad in Argentina this semester. As I am well aware, the country is currently in a state of economic distress and, as the unemployment rate is extremely high, many of the inhabitants have resorted to petty crime, such as pickpocketing, in an attempt to make ends meet. There's the background.

A few days ago (today I didn't fuck up.. but I sure did on Saturday morning) I was leaving a guy's apartment after he had already left to go to work. I get myself all ready to go and see half of the joint we had smoke from the night before sitting in the ashtray on the table. I have nothing else really to do the rest of the day so I decide to take a few puffs. Feeling nice and buzzed, I put my iPhone headphones in my hears, turned on my music and went along my way. After realizing the commute home would have been a 1.5 hour long walk I decide to wait at the 124 bus stop. There were trucks parked in the spaces in front of the stop so it was difficult to see the bus and to consequently hail it down. The woman in front kept walking into the street to see if the bus was coming, so I figured I'd leave that to her in order to eventually get on the bus. This was my first mistake, being completely still giving my assailants time to scope me out. A few minutes later a man comes up to me and mentions I have a stain on my back and that I should clean it. I feel around my coat and find nothing, so I continue in my trance from the playlist and the sunny day and the weed and the waiting. Then another woman comes up and AGAIN mentions that there's something on my back. At this point I start to feel around my shoulders and when I pull my hand back I see that there is a huge glob of saliva on my skin. There are several trails of spit on my clothes. Fucking gross. I also didn't know that throwing liquids/trash/SPITTING on people is a means of distraction for pickpocketers. Awesome.. yay ignorance. While trying to clean myself up I become hazily aware of this woman and her two children standing uncomfortably close to me. I was on a busy street and I didn't think much of it, though my personal space was most definitely invaded. I didn't even notice my music stop playing. All of a sudden she's gone and a street vendor is yelling at me, bringing me down to earth telling me that I had just been robbed. Then it all clicks.

Of COURSE that's what just happened!

My initial reaction was.. uh.. wait... what.. OH WHAT THE FUCK!!! and i just kept thinking to myself: ""why the fuck didn't this vendor intervene while he saw everything happening!?!?"" I mean maybe the people were armed, there's many reasons. So he tells me that she got onto a bus that was (wow just my luck!) stopped at the red light a few yards away. As i confusedly approach, I realize that there are three buses, all completely stuffed. There's no way that I am finding her ever again. Had my iPhone jacked right out from under my nose. Felt like a total idiot, also violated from the saliva shower. Only solace is that the screen was completely fucked. Oh well..

TL;DR Got spat on and robbed while stoned and studying abroad in a foreign country without even realizing until it was over.

burnt_taco,135,135,1ny109,551,"The house was empty, I was horny and it seemed like the perfect time to break out my favorite powerful (but loud) vibrator for some much needed self lovin'. So I opened my toybox, took out my beloved vibe, plugged him in and moaned in bliss as he hummed away on my aching nether regions.

My body began to tense, I groaned as I felt my orgasm build and then suddenly... ""POP!!!""

A puff of smoke rose from between my legs as I unceremoniously threw the dead beast to the floor and scrambled to yank his still hot cord from the wall as it bit my tender flesh mercilessly and left a drop of molten plastic firmly latched to my flesh. As the cord flew across the room the smoke detector mockingly screamed at me, when suddenly I smelled the smoldering carpet beside my bed.

Momentarily forgetting about my charred lady bits, I jumped from the bed and dumped a glass of water on my floor and the carcass of the vengeful plastic monstrosity that I once cherished so deeply. And no sooner did the water hit the floor than my mom charged in to ""save"" me after hearing the smoke alarm and my aggressive verbal attack against the vile, flame throwing vibrator. She looked at me with an odd mix of horror, concern, and bemusement as I stood naked over a large vibrator sitting in the middle of a puddle on the floor and my once pink taco now covered in black soot.

It didn't help that I'm working with a really hot girl and I'm probably ovulating because I'm horny as fuck. Regular stress + sexual frustration = having a bad time.

I managed to get a break in during the afternoon and went out to my car to smoke (it was raining and I had no other protection). Thought to myself ""Hey know what would be such a good idea? Why don't you rub one off real quick before you go back into work! That'll calm you down and maybe make you not want to jump that girl's bones so much!"" Fucking fantastic idea!

Normally she has a bowel movement in the morning, and lets me know right away. (They stink) To be safe, I don't usually put her in the bouncer until she's done it, but whoops I forgot. Unfortunately for both of us today she decided that the bouncer was so much fun it didn't matter. It **really** didn't help that her diaper had shifted sideways a bit, so most of the poop missed. It was on her onesie, on the bouncer's seat, on the side of her leg- a pretty typical blowout, right?

Many of you may have heard of a little thing called Snapchat. Significantly fewer of you may have heard of a cosmetic item called a charcoal mask. To be brief, Snapchat is a social picture taking smartphone application that allows captioned photos to be shared with friends for a set number of seconds. Charcoal masks are creamyish face masks that contain charcoal, and are therefore black in color, intended to clean pores.

After a few drinks, a friend convinced me to apply the charcoal mask to my face. Of course, upon looking at myself in the mirror, I immediately regretted my actions and felt somewhat emasculated. I do not know what overcame me, but I decided to share my poor decision with an abundance of friends via Snapchat.

SpiffShientz,12,6,1nv2tp,2,"I'm a playwright. I write plays. The head of the Theatre Company I'm a part of has been kind enough to agree on producing one of my scripts, ""Drinking with Doctors"". It's about alcoholism, and it's a rather sober piece (ha). She's offering to let me produce it as well, in that I can choose the director. I'd like to avoid directing it myself, because I hate being a control freak. It's one of my biggest worries. Plus, directing is an insanely stressful job - you're in charge of set layout, actor direction, and due to the small size of our company, taking a role yourself.

So we're at a big meeting, and I ask for everyone's attention for a minute.

""Pardon me, everyone - I've recently completed a script, and I'm looking for anyone interested in directing. Anyone in?""

Immediately, a couple of hands shoot up, and I freeze. It strikes me then that choosing a director is basically puppet directing. I was being a control freak again. Oh, God. Oh, God, panic attack incoming. So I let out a couple of awkward noises - ""Ehhhh...""  Heuuuuu....."" ""Nyehayhoo...."", you know, the regulars - and I finally blurt out ""Okay, everyone decide amongst yourselves, have a nice day!""

My buddy Ray, being among the loudest of the loud, steps atop a chair, and his voice trumpets across the stage - ""*I'LL DO IT!*""

Okay, Ray is a cool guy. He's funny, he's energetic, and he's a pretty great dancer. But I've never seen him direct before. ""Whatever,"" I foolishly thought, ""He's been in theatre for years now, I'm sure he's got a handle on this."", and I continued on my merry way. 

Now, in his past, Ray was the kind of guy who would frequent /r/ImGoingToHellForThis. You know the kind, the one who believes ""AIDS"" is a suitable 3rd step for a knock-knock joke. He's kind of grown out of it, but a lot of that over-the-top, ""edgy"" humor is still there. The script I wrote is largely dramatic, and this discrepancy hit me about a minute after I walked out of there. Crisis time. I started hyperventilating about the kind of nonsensical, parodic freakshow my literary baby would become. Then, inspiration! I'd get someone to co-direct with him.

So I turn back in, claiming I'd forgotten my wallet(Joke's on them, I can't afford a wallet), and I stop by my friend Ina. Ina is, simply put, a bad-ass. She's strict, no-nonsense, and her involvement in many sports are a guarantee she could hand most anyone in the company their ass on a platter. As a result of this, she commands the respect of pretty much everyone. 

""Hey, Ina,"" I say, ""Are you interested in co-directing with Ray?""

""Sure, why not.""

Ecstatic, I hand her a master copy of the script and joyfully skip back to my house. 

Saturday rolls around (yesterday, to be precise). We've got a read-through of my script scheduled. Unfortunately, Ina can't make it because of the aforementioned sports stuff; and even then, as she reveals to us, she only wants to *assistant*-direct, not co-direct. So Ray's still in charge.

""Okay,"" I thought, ""This won't be that bad. My script's pretty depressing. It could use some comedy.""

Every doubt I had about Ray was validated when he told one of the actors to read his lines ""blacker"". Every subsequent direction he gave was also along the lines of turning my script into an Adam Sandler comedic farce, and that is so worrying to me, because it's not designed to be straight comedy. Not to mention, he's cast himself as the romantic lead. I don't mean to be rude, and he's definitely not a bad-looking guy, but he's 5'6"" and not in the best shape, and a guy named Blair would be much better suited. Blair's lithe and chiseled, as opposed to Ray's short and normal.

Thing is, if I talk to the head of the company to get him removed, I enter that control-freak territory. I'd look like the kind of writer who packs up their ball and goes home if they don't get exactly what they want. Plus, I really don't want to hurt Ray's feelings. He's a really cool guy, I just don't like the way he's taking my script.

Itsrane,26,10,1nsfke,45,"I was not doing well this past week. Not well at all. No amount of straining produced more than the smallest, puniest little bit of hard poop, while the pressure of the rest taunted me. I tried eating greens. Lots of greens. Water. Nothing worked. 

So I decided to tackle this medicinally. I got a box of laxative pills.

I usually pride myself in knowing what to do with medication. Maybe hubris was my downfall? I don't know. Pride goeth before the fall, and so on. 

I looked the directions over carefully. It said to take a pill, and to expect a movement (so to speak) 6 to 8 hours afterwards. If that doesn't work, the box told me, take another 1 to 3 pills, without going over 3 pills a day. *Hah!* I thought. *One pill? And it might not do it's job? I'll just take 2 now. I've been poopless for a week!*

This was yesterday. I took the pills and went to bed.

This morning, I was awakened by a loud rumbling from my gut. I felt hot, and a thin sheen of sweat covered my body. *Ah, it's the laxatives!* I ran to the bathroom. 

Everything was expelled. I bet my colon is shiny now.

But here's where my fuck up comes into play.

The cramping doesn't go away. It continues. I instinctively strain, but there's nothing more to strain out.

And so I sit here, typing this out, while my stomach tries to eject itself through my ass.

**Post-sit edit:** I either did not learn my lesson, or I'm tempting fate. But I can't say no to the first cup of coffee of the day. I hope I don't need to edit this with more fuckery (though I think you guys hope that I do).",TIFU by overestimating my digestive system,55

So to the fuck up. I recently got out of a long relationship and have been avoiding going out and getting drunk, but today my Course mate convinced me to go to his house party, coincidentally my best friend asks if I'm up to much that night, so I invite him along, he's a friend from home so I told him he could crash at mine on my sofa. So at this party I start getting along with this girl and she seems cool and it's obvious where it's leading. In my intoxicated state I thought it would be a good step towards getting over my ex. In doing so I may have slightly neglected my best friend who only knew me at the party, that's the first part of the fuck up. 

Fast forward to the end of the night and I've slept with the girl, now as I'm sobering up I'm realising several things, 1-I was and am still not anywhere near ready to sleep with anyone after the break up, and 2- I can't sleep in my single bed with her in it. Just can't. So here I am sitting on my bedroom floor at 6:45am considering how pissed my best friend is going to be for not hanging out with him much after he made the effort to come see me. Oh and how am I going to let this nice girl down without coming across as an arrogant dick who just wanted sex?

Realizing the murder scene likely waiting beneath my pale thighs, I opted for a courtesy flush. For my dog Toby's sake. This is where things go wrong. 

As I flush, I realize that it sounds a bit different. As I'm trying break down exactly what could cause that, the back of my neck breaks out in what I assume to be a cold sweat. Realizing I'm not that out of shape, I decided that there must be an alternative answer. It seems that the tiny hose that controls the water flow for my tank had broken loose. This change in engineering had let loose a torrent of water out of the side. 

Knowing this isn't a sustainable development in my bathroom logistics, I spring into action. 

Unfortunately for my story, springing into action is less dramatic than expected and consists solely of removing the tank's lid.

ifuckedupbad_12,207,197,1nq6h0,469,"So yesterday I turned up a few minuets late to college, I try looking for my class but can't find them, I go to a class where the lecturer asks me to wait whilst they try and get ahold of my lecturer. Whilst waiting, the person I've been waiting for comes into the classroom and I end up leaving the classroom with him.
He tells me that the people who have turned up have mostly gone home because they couldn't find the class that we were meant to be in and that he was phoning around and trying to get people to come back in. We have a polite conversation and he tells me that I don't have a class until 11am and it'll hopefully be in the room that's timetabled for us. By this point it's twenty past nine in the morning and I have an hour and 40 minuets to kill, so I decide to go to somewhere familiar and end up doing that for awhile. When my friends go on their break I join them, I've completely lost track of time by this point and by the time I've noticed this, it's already half past 11 and I go hunting for my class, I go to the room that's been timetabled, or atleast I thought was timetabled, and no-one was in there, so I've ended up in the library fucking around on the internet, my friend, lets call him Sam, has joined me by this point and I tell him the situation, he agrees to go to the library and we're both just fucking around, I'm on Tumblr and he's on YouTube and stuff. 
I should of really known better than to go on Tumblr but there really isn't much else to do and as my dashboard has some 'explicit' content, I try my best to scroll past it as quick as I can without causing a problem, however as I'm doing this a message pops up on my screen saying that 'screenshots are being taken of my 'inappropriate' use of the computers and are being sent to my lecturer', I obviously closed Tumblr straight away because I didn't know my computer usage was being monitored and the next thing I know my computer has been logged off and my account has been logged off, I didn't really think much of it, to be honest, was abit worried but I was just thinking that I'll get a smack on the wrist, type of thing. 

Fast-forward to today, my parents have been called and the college are calling a meeting about my 'inappropriate' behaviour and I know it's not going to end very well at all. 


TL;DR - Couldn't find my college class so I went to the college library where I was browsing Tumblr, instead of trying to find to my class, screenshots of 'explicit' content which I was trying to scroll past on Tumblr was screenshotted by admins who work in the library and sent to my college lecturer, they phoned my parents and have called a meeting for Tuesday afternoon and I'm probably going to be kicked out of college because I'm on a trial period anyway.

Set up. Today I received a text, out of the blue, from a longtime friend. She (19) and I (19 m) have known each other since about first grade. The text asked me that, were someone to offer me a blow job, if I'd accept. Thinking one of her friends took her phone and is simply messing with me, I answer coyly. ""Is that a proposition?"" ""Yes,"" she replied, ""I'm offering to give you head.""

I feign concern, ask if her BF isn't doing it for her anymore, etc (remember, I'm thinking that this is one of her friends) and to make a long story a bit shorter, I found out that it actually is her and that her BF not only dumped her, but cheated on her. Apparently, I was her goto revenge fun. I'm not complaining.

She says my embarrassment is cute and reminds me that it would be impossible for that to happen when it comes down to it. This was just a rehearsal and the final act needs some work. 

She says that she ought to sleep. I agree.

Now for the past 2 weeks I've began to sort of fall for her, she's always on my mind and I always cheer up when I see her. She's smart funny and really hot (great ass, nice rack, cute face, and pretty hair) For the last week or so we've been skipping or going late to some after school activities so we can hang out (track for me cross country for her if anyone cared) and we've been talking about spending more time together outside of school, now Sky has been obviously sending me messages like casual flirting, wanting me to wait for her so we can walk to class together or wanting me to walk to her locker with her after class almost got me in trouble a day I had detention, I was roaming the halls with her and we were talking about TV she liked, I didn't realize I was 10 minutes late and found it hard to make myself break away from her and meander down to the room in which it was held that day.

On with the tale now! 

So today as usual we text, snap chat, &amp; etc through the whole study hall, I pack up all my shit and walk over to her (she sits across the room the seats are assigned by last name) and we casually chat all the way to our class, class goes by teacher's talking about stuff we're not really paying attention while talking to each other and people right around us (she mentions ole Frederick once) Class ends and I tell her I'm skipping track to go home and sleep, so we say bye and go our separate ways. so I go home and pass out on the couch, wake up to a Facebook message notification from an old friend I hadn't talked to in a long time (he moved to another city) and we caught up over several messages, we got to talking about each others girl situation's I told him about Sky and hit send about halfway through what I was saying the ""blank is typing"" thing came up and didn't go away for a few minutes so I put my Droid down and shut my eyes, the phone vibrates and I read his message, so I unlock the phone and touch the messenger icon (fuckup imminent) and without really looking I proceed to type 

""Dude she's awesome and I really like her, just idk how to tell her, &amp; even If I did she seems into the German guy anyways sigh....""

 That's it verbatim copied from the message. And hit send, hearing no response tone I go back to sleep, fast forward to 730 pm I awake to see I have three texts. I had not sent the message to my freind through Facebook messenger I had texted my last texted person through regular texting, guess who got it? Sky. The three texts came about 20 min after mine they were 

""Who?"" (Referring to who do I like)

""Oh."" (About a minute later)

""I gecha"" (about the same time as ""oh"")

 I texted her : ""Oh... I meant to msg that to a FB friend I was talking to...""

That was closing in on two hours ago and I don't have a response.. I don't know, maybe I missed something maybe she doesn't like me, or... I just I don't know I'm really down now, I really liked her and I was exited to start being together more and such...

Legion299,8,6,1nmtkt,9,"**WARNING**: extreme stupidity, autism, bipolar and dumbassry.

Before you say I am a completely retarded dumbass, I am very well aware of this and I wish I could go back in time and maul myself to death.

It was a bit special Wednesday because I couldn't access my computer 2 days prior to that and here I am, excited and ready to use the shit out of my computer when suddenly it BSODs. When I try to start it, it gave some beep codes which wasn't listed in the official beep code list. I was like ""God dammit"" and decided to be SuperRepairman!

Keep in mind, I have NO FUCKING clue about computers other than basics. I know what the mobo does, what the CPU does etc. But nothing advanced and nothing that should excuse me into opening the heatsink.

While internally, I was aware it's a memory problem and the most logical step was to wait until tommorow and call my merchant and ask for a replacement (warranty).

But NOPE, I was full on retarded mode and decided in a Hulk-voice ""i WANT PLAY NOW!!!!!!!!!111"".
I then carefully placed the computer's sides upwards so I could get a good look. What seemed like a cautious way of handling the computer was followed by me going rambo on the heatsink fan, I couldn't figure out how to unlock the metal bars (AM3 slot) and I proceed to use brute force on that shit.

Then, what happens next was that my heatsink wouldn't come off. It was around 3 years since I had to take off my heatsink so I was like ""Hmm, I don't remember if it's supposed to do this or ***not***""

I then proceed to brute force the heatsink. GUESS WHAT HAPPENS! THE **GODDAMN** ***CPU*** **CHIP** CAME OFF WITH IT! 

I didn't notice this at first, I was like ""Oh, this is totally normal, moving on!"". I then look at the mobo's CPU socket and I found no CPU. I was so fucking retarded atthat moment I had the nerves to think 

""Wait what?... There's on CPU in here... uhhh what the hell could this mean?.... WAIT! Does this mean that I had been using the computer with no CPU this whole time?!""

But fortunately I was not that retarded, I shook it off and found out the CPU chip was in fact **GLUED** to the heatsink. This was obviously probably because I had poor thermalpaste placement, so I proceed to BRUTE FORCE the CPU off which resulted in the edge being bended. You should of seen when I seperated the CPU and the heatsink. 

I used a pen's other end and started to use it like a crowbar between the CPU and the heatsink (it had a small gap) and then **FUCKIN' BAM** the CPU chip came off and proceeded to land on the ground with a clear *CHINK* noise while it hit the ground. Imagine a small tiny jewel being polished by a blacksmith when he's trying to make a Greatsword goddammit. 

I then pick it up, and luckily no visible damage was done except the edge bended because I had used a pen-crowbar to seperate it from the heatsink. I put it in the socket, and then I put the heatsink over, then I proceed to lock in the metal bars on the heatsink.... but guess what? I didn't properly **put the CPU in the socket**, but I didn't realize that. So here is me trying to brute force the **FUCK** out of the metal bars while my CPU chip's pins was getting bended.

It took around 5 minutes until I gave up and took a look at the CPU chip itself. Also, before I did this, if you know the metal lock for the CPU socket, when I took out the CPU heatsink the CPU chip was also attached to it. BIG RED FLAG right here, BUT I was so oblivious and retarded I thought it was normal until a bit later. The socket lock was also not unlocked, which was a very big red flag.

I then noticed the CPU pins bent, so I grabbed a pen and started to go on craftsmen and readjust it. Instead of using a long object to properly adjust them I use a fucking pen. After that's done, I put it in and proceed to properly lock the heatsink. 

After all that is done, I turn it back on. Surprisingly, it still worked but it still had the same problem. So in conclusion, I basically probably permanently damaged my CPU, mobo, case when in the end it was all a memory problem.

My shift was about to end when I messed up hard. After I cleaned a table, I went to get napkins and utensils to set onto the table. The thing is, I pulled the tray out with too much force and completely underestimated the weight of the utensils. The tray slipped out of my hands; forks, knives and spoons just poured like rain onto the floor. The sound of  all the metal hitting the floor was deafening and caused a huge ruckus. 
 
My face flushing red, there was nothing I could do but pick up all the utensils on the floor, which amounted to about 3/4 ths of the supply, and send them to the back for the dishwasher to clean them.

mustangwolf1997,1,10,1nmoab,0,"Well, as the titls says, we were going to a park second period to smoke up. 

Let's call my one friend William, and the other John. There's also this girl I like who was supposed to come with us, but never met us down outside the school. Let's call her Jane.

One the walk there, William was already fucked, we start talking about random shit.

The conversation goes on and on, and we're sounding like we're all high. 

We get to the park and decide to cut through the swingset area. 

The sand had been freshly placed, so it was soft.

William said it's like we were walking on the moon, and John walked onto the grass because the ground was so soft it was hurting his leg. I followed John, because it was hurting mine, too. ( John was stabbed in the leg a couple years ago, and I was hit by a car back in May.)

When I step off, don't ask why I said it because I have. Absolutly NO IDEA... I made a comment along the lines of ""I want to piss in the sand.""

I hear a familiar voice say ""oh that's disgusting!""

Fuck... Jane is here, and she heard me!

We left in silence and went to the bench on the other side of the park just to find out something horrible.

John left his weed at home.

We wound up going back the next day, except instead of William, a different friend came. And she bought weed for the sesh.

We wound up having our sesh with Jane and her friend, and laughed our asses off about the day before.

qwerb,43,18,1nmf4w,42,"Don't worry, that crisis has already been averted. She had a Plan B pill.

My real blunder is as such:

So, I met this girl on OkCupid, and it turns out that she and I go to the same local community college. This is amazing because I live in a very small and remote desert community in Southern California, so pickings are pretty slim when it comes to dating. Anywho, we exchange messages on the website for a couple of days and then eventually move on to texting before ultimately deciding to meet up one day on campus. This girl is amazing for a few reasons. The first being that she is actually close to my own age (I am 30, she is 29) because the vast majority of the girls at this school are like 18-21. We immediately hit off, as far as interests go, when we were still messaging each other on the website. We like the same music and movies, we have similar school and career goals, we both have weird families, and a whole lot of other weird ass shit. So yeah, you get the picture.

Fast forward to last night:

I get a call from her around midnight. We had both been drinking beers for the better part of the evening, so we each had a pretty decent buzz going. She wants to know if she can come over for a bit to hang out since she was driving through my town anyways, and it was on the way of a long drive home. In my drunken haze I said yes, of course. She get's here like 20 minutes later and we spent the next few hours just hanging out in my room and talking about all sorts of things. Around four in the morning we are both starting to pass out and she asks if she can spend the night, so I say yes, and as soon as we are comfortable on my bed, sharing my one pillow, sexy times commence. I should note here that it has been several years since I have been in a relationship, and a year and a half since I've last had sex, so I was incredibly eager to do this and also not fuck it up in the process. 

We start moving pretty fast, sort of like two bunny rabbits on crystal meth. We make out, that turns into heavy petting, which turns into clothes coming off, and then we're fucking. This is all within like 15 minutes. Now, since it had been so long for me, I was trying my damned hardest not to finish too fast, for her sake of course. Nope. Wrong. I can feel it starting to build up after about 3 minutes of thrusting. I'm thinking to myself, ""I can do this. I can make this last god dammit."" I manage to hold out for another couple of minutes, but then there is nothing I can do and I just unload inside. It was a tough decision to decide whether or not to pull out because I was still hard and I wanted to make sure she got hers too, so I just kept going until she sounded like she peaked. The worst part is that I didn't tell her that I finished inside until the morning when we were cuddling right before she had to leave to go to class. She didn't say anything at the time, other than that it was cool because she has a pill she can take, and we're all good. So I think we are all good. Wrong.

As I'm on the bus to school later in the morning, I get about 5 text messages in a row from her saying that me finishing inside AND THEN not telling her till the morning was really upsetting. It was pure luck, apparently, that she had the pill, and if she hadn't we both would have been fucked, even though she is cool with getting an abortion. She also tells me that years ago she miscarried a child that she really wanted at the time, so there's that little extra bit to make feel even shittier than I already do.

So, long story longer, I basically fucked up the potential for an awesome relationship with a cool girl in just a few days because I was a selfish idiot and didn't pull out. I also think I just set a new record for the fastest relationship fuck up.

shmustache,21,13,1njseq,50,"So this wasn't a huge fuck up, but it was pretty embarrassing in the moment. Some background: I'm a senior in high school, taking an AP English class. I'm pretty sure the teacher likes my friends and I, although we find her to be rather... Unlikable, we'll say. Anyways, this class focuses on mostly British literature for most of the year, so we were going over some basic British history. The teacher, knowing I am in enrolled in European History and at least sort of know my stuff, asks me to describe the whole Thomas a Becket/ King Henry situation. So, as I begin talking, I very casually say, ""Yeah, Thomas a Becket and the King were butt-buddies and they-"" and my teacher yells ""WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?!?"" Her face is bright red, and I'm confused as hell. I just meant that the two were really close friends and spent all there time together. I say the same thing when I make fun of two freinds who hang out a lot. It was meant to be innocent. She makes me apologize for making a ""completely inappropriate comment"" and tells me I'm lucky to not be sent to the office and shit. Of course, I didn't see the big deal, so I wasn't *that* apologetic. I mean, we're all seniors in the class, practically adults, saying the word ""butt"" shouldn't really be a problem. In fact, I was pretty annoyed at being chided for what seemed to ME to be nothing. Later, my teacher comes over asks me what I was thinking. ""Do you even know what that means?"" 

""Yeah, its just, you know, when two guys are friends and spend all their time together. You know butt buddies..."" And then I saw her facial expression. 

""Ooooh, *But Buddies*."" Apparently butt buddies is a literal term for gay lovers. Who knew? Everybody in that class but me I guess.

I don't know about anyone else, but occasionally, I get huge... er.. zits inbetween my legs, not at my crotch, but on my inner thighs. Sometimes these things get massive, like to the point that I'm worried I'll have Staph.

I love using Western Digital because their stuff is awesome. So I went to Canada Computers to purchase a 1 TB Passport Drive and an external BD drive, since I own a lot of Blu-Ray movies.

I get home and I want to start moving my files from another 1 TB Passport Drive I have to the new one I just bought. Since both of them are Identical both of them, when plugged in have the same name when appearing on the screen ""My Passport.""

tehtreats,20,11,1ngpzx,12,"**Backstory:**


About a year ago, my best friend got me a small cast iron pan as a gift. It's my first and only and I've made sure to season and treat it with the tastiest greases and flavors. Living in a studio apartment by myself at the time, I didn't need to worry about it having any soapy encounters. I took care to wipe excessive gross out of it and would occasionally place it in the oven while baking dinner. Otherwise it proudly sat on the shelf or stove top.


I recently moved into a place with three other people, all good friends that I've known for years - Sweet D, Chicago, and Frank. There's also a dog and a cat that are about the same size and even they know better than to wash a pan of this nature. **I fucked up** by not addressing this matter immediately.


**How I set us all up for failure:**


A few nights ago, Frank and I were getting a little frisky in the kitchen (by which frisky mean sprinkling brown sugar on top of bacon-wrapped chunks of chicken breast with any leftover bacon strewn about the cookie pan) and I took things to the next level by sticking my cast iron on another rack in the oven. We got into some things that r/trees would appreciate and more or less watched bacon bake and talked about how delicious this was going to be, our upcoming schedules, school, life, etc. 17 minutes goes by and the loose bacon is more than ready to be in my mouth. Another 13 minutes goes by and those little chunks of yum are pleading to be in my belly. Plate up, chow down, leftovers to the fridge, time for a bedtime bowl and thoughtless browsing. The cast iron is still in the now cooled oven and the furthest thing from my mind.


**How I impressively kept my cool:**


I got home around 9:30 last night after a 12 hour day of work and related functions. Anxious to put my feet up and indulge in some libations, I noted the cleanliness of the joint and made sure to thank Sweet D and Chicago and open them each a fresh beer. We got to chatting about the previous day and I showed off our new dish brush when Sweet D said it.. something about that dirty pan in the sink destroying the old brush.  My heart dropped like a plummet. I realized what had happened without even seeing it.


I slowly turned towards the sink and confirmed that which I feared most and already knew to be true. My pan, face down in the dish rack, like some kind of crime scene. No trace of grease or spice, not a hint of age or use. It looked newer than when it was purchased, even the factory season had been washed off. I shook at the knees as I picked it up from that stainless steel basin from hell and stared at its smooth matted black coat. The glisten was gone, the flavor forlorn. 


As I clutched my sullied skillet, I could only manage eek out the request that they *never, ever* wash this pan again. I explained that I knew they didn't know any better and that they were simply trying to help. I hadn't made it clear and left the pan in a frequently used appliance. They stared at me like deer in headlights, they could see my blood boiling beneath the crooked smile and hurt in my eyes. The last year of cooking flashed before me, even concoctions that the pan never saw. 


They knew what they had done, but they didn't understand why it was wrong. The road to hell is paved with good intentions and I finally understood. I painstakingly described the history of cast iron and the mechanics of seasoning. I explained my own personal efforts of seasoning that they had just washed down the drain, without thought. My voice trembled as I spoke, but I remained calm as I fired up the oven and regreased the pan. 


350 degrees, we're off to a good start. 500 degrees, that pan is roasting. 


Sweet D starts in on the peace offerings.. flowers, blunts, whatever it will take. I told her the best thing she could do to make up for it is cook some bacon and just wipe the excess grease out of the pan. I clarified what can and cannot be cooked in a cast iron. I begged that they never wash it and stick it in the oven if they don't want to see it.

Naturally before I went over to her house, I started pleasuring myself because I had thirty minutes before it was time to leave. I cleaned up and headed on my way. We sat down and began the movie and about 10 minutes in the movie, her family dog, ""Trevor"" came into the room. Trevor was really happy to see me. Trevor began smelling around the living room. I thought he was smelling the cookies her mother made, nope. Needless to say, Trevor found what he was looking for. Trevor began smelling my crouch. My girlfriend and her Dad began to notice. Before I figured out what he was doing, he began to lick my pants. Trevor was really getting on with it, before my girlfriend pulled him away. The rest of Happy Gilmore went fine.

juuuuice,6,10,1ngk2n,33,"I started sleep walking this past summer and I'm not really sure why.  I have some pretty funny stories from roommates, however this incident takes the cake.  I woke up this morning without any blankets on and the sheet torn off my bed.  I thought that was odd, but I felt this crusty substance on my face.  I was confused and went to rub it off when I saw my hands and they were covered in dried blood.  Panicking, I went to hop off my bunk (I'm on the top).  I noticed my left, big toe was in a lot of pain and bruised, and I struggled walking.  Anyway, I get to the mirror in the bathroom and there is blood all over my face and a giant gash in between both of my eyebrows.  I start cleaning it up and it began to bleed again.  Luckily I was able to stop it, however, I did some investigating to see if I could piece together what exactly happened.  There was already a lot of dried blood in the sink, so I'm assuming I stumbled over to the mirror in my sleep walking state to try to clean it.  The weirdest part was the blood that was around the door frame leading outside of my apartment and a small pool of it on the ground.  But, there wasn't any blood on the doorknob.  There was also very little blood on my sheets and pillows.  I asked my roommates, but they did not see anything.  The worst part is now I'm walking around campus and literally everyone is asking me what happened.  Half the people I talk to think I'm possessed.  Anyway, that's what happened.

Thinc_Ng_Kap,18,47,1nfoyn,133,"To be more accurate, this happened about a month ago, but it feels like it happened just yesterday.

I was drunk. I was stupidly drunk actually. I was going to the washroom and I somehow managed to slip right at the doorway. I fell so quickly (or at least it seemed very quickly) that I didnt get my hands out in time to catch my fall. Down I went right onto the tiles, and soon enough there was blood just *pouring* from my lip. Im now kneeling on the washroom floor, looking down at a huge pool of blood,  waiting for the stream of blood to stop flowing from my lip. Eventually I get fed up with the waiting and begin to just swallow my blood (dont ask why I didnt bother going to the toilet to let the blood go in there- Im trying to figure that one out for myself.) Anyway, by now I've drunk a ton of blood that it makes me puke- twice. Again, on the floor, not in the toilet. This whole ordeal was tiring, and with the addition of being very drunk I decide to just lay down in the bathroom for a second or two, right beside the pool of blood and the vomit. 

I dont really know how long I slept for, but I do remember waking up and staring at puke right in front of my face and mutter ""fuck, I did it again."" I then find my friends couch and fall asleep a second time. Soon after, I am awoken to my friend yelling""**HOLY SHIT, THERES BLOOD EVERYWHERE IN THE BATHROOM!!**"", I calmly tell him not to worry about it and that I'll clean it up in the morning. 

Fast forward to the morning, Im awoken by a group of my friends leaning over the couch and starring at my face. ""Shit, that wasnt a dream"" I say to myself while feeling my lip, which is now 3 times its normal size."" 

They're all telling me I need to go get stitches or at least get it looked at. I refuse, telling them this happened once before (exact same situation) and that it'll heal on its own. I clean up my bodily expellings, we go to the store and then head to the beach for the rest of the weekend. Life goes on. 

The scab falls off about a week later after the incident, and find I have a very nasty looking scar on my lip. As if the whole ordeal wasnt enough, the scar makes it look like I have herpes, which my friends constantly laugh at me for. Lovely.

StreetsofGalway,9,5,1nf1pa,20,"My brother makes guacamole every once in a while. Generally, it's very well regarded, though our mom doesn't like how spicy it is. Personally I love spicy food and it doesn't bother me at all. In fact, I usually seek it out; I put sriracha on everything I eat. But this guacamole... this was different. This was of the devil. I would commend my brother for making something so spicy, but I don't think he was trying to; some evil conferred and willed it so. 

I walked into the kitchen and noticed two unfinished bowls of guacamole our parents had started. I should have heeded this warning when I had the chance. I took a fairly large amount, since there was a lot left. Again, many warnings which I didn't take. I sat down with my bowl and some chips, and plunged into the abyss unarmed. The first bite didn't feel like food. My mouth felt like Dresden. I put in another chip. I thought that, surely, that the first one was a mistake. My mouth made an error; nothing felt like that. Then I ate another chip. Then another. I kept telling myself my mouth was a liar. My mouth is not a liar. He's a nice guy. I decided to get a glass of water. The relief was short and weak, but there was some, and I soldiered on. I continued eating chips. My mouth continued to cry out in anguish. I decided to get a glass of milk. This seemed to help much more than the water, and allowed me to finish the bowl. This was a mistake. I should not have finished the bowl. 

But anyway. I finished the bowl, and then finished the milk. My mouth continued to burn. The longer nothing was in my mouth, the more excruciating the pain got. I then decided to brush my teeth and expunge my mouth of all impurities. This did little but react with the milk to cause a large amount of phlegm. This becomes important later. 

I then decided to try mouthwash. Surely some of you are smarter than me and realize what a terrible mistake this was. Seriously, if you ever eat some demonic guacamole, do NOT use mouthwash. Why would you do that you dummy geez what is wrong with you omg. But anyway. I made this stupid mistake, which was stupid, and my mouth suffered. The fire raged. It raged with incredible intensity, and it raged forever. I decided to just wash my mouth out best I could. This is where the phlegm gets important. I started coughing it up at an abnormal rate. Then I threw up and, no joke, some fucking guacamole came out with it. 

But then I felt fine.",TIFU by eating guacamole,25

It was 3 AM, just got off using my computer and looking at Pornography,
I get in bed, and then turn off the lamp on my nightstand, then i start Fapping away after a few minutes... This is where the shit hit the fan, little boys and Girls, as i was whacking off, i thought i'd do some... Sounding with my usual Mechanical friend that i have. so i shoved it in, slowly, but deeper each time, and i had done this before, infact, alot. so my Golden Shower hose was fairly wide enough to fit it in, so i kept going, then, suddenly, i shove it in all the way by accident.... I then spend 25 mins trying to pull it out... but [IT WAS NO USE!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMUvFw0VlY4). the thing was stuck in there.

So my next thought is, wait for my father to wake up, and tell him what happened 5 AM rolls around, and then my dad wakes up, so i immediately tell him what happens, he then hurriedly gets dressed and takes me to the hospital, 10 mins later, we're inside the hospital, i get led into a room with my dad, it looks similar to an Operating room, but.. smaller. I lay down on this Patient bed and wait, doctor arrives, shit happens, then he gets the urologist, who bears a Striking resemblance to The Governor from The Walking Dead. TV version. Anyways, he does some Stuff, looks at my Peen to insure how deep this Mechanical Fiend is inside my Shlong, etc. 

He then leaves again, humming some weird Funk-like tune, and then him, The doctor, and the Male Nurse arrive with the WMDs. He then pulls it out, almost violently with 2 pairs of Surgical Tweezers while the doctor applies a Numbing gel onto my Man noodle, it took probably 5 mins... but it felt like an hour. BUt then finally, he gets the thing out, then the Urologist immediately says ""Hah, wanna keep it?"" and the doctor then says ""Remember, things don't go in there, they only come out of there."" and then they laugh it off, and all i can think is ""Thank FUCK for plan A."" because the doc said there was 2 plans. Plans A and B.
Plan A was pulling the thing out with no Surgery. Plan B was Surgery.

throwaway123969568,30,25,1neslk,77,"TL;DR: There's a time and a place for sexy-times.  A school is never the place, no matter the time. 

Context: I, along with my girlfriend, were both some of the most trusted and well-respected students in our high school.  We tutor every day, we ace all our classes, and the like. 

Last Thursday was one of those miraculous days where both of us were in heat.  The entire day we had to fight the urge to just, you know, do it. 

Flash-forward to the end of Thursday. We're both tutoring for our English class and all the class is doing is reading so we both decide to leave for a bit and stroll around.  

As we're strolling around the campus we notice that one of the classrooms has been left unlocked... Holy shit. This is a 17 year old's wet dream. I go in and check if anyone is in.  Nobody is.  Both of us then sneak in and hot sexy-times occur.  

Not 5 minutes in we hear the door rattle. 

Shit.

It's a neighboring teacher coming in to find some staples. He asks what we were doing here and we just play it off as if we're looking for a specific book for our tutoring class.  The teacher doesn't bat an eye and continues to look for some staples while my gf and I split as soon as we could (with the phony book in hand), counting our blessings.

Now we're in the hallway, still very much in heat, with a book that isn't ours. In our infinite wisdom we decide to ask another neighboring teacher for her keys under the pretense of returning a book we forgot about.  The nice teacher hands us the keys. 

We then proceed back into the room, return the book, and look at each other with lustful eyes.  Hardcore sexytimes proceed.  

Flash-forward another 10 minutes and there I am, my hands down my gf's pants, hers in mine, as our janitor walks in.  

We hastily stop, and leave.  Not saying a word to the janitor who has this face of disgust and disappointment.

That concludes Thursday.  

Flash-forward one more time to Friday morning. My gf and I are hanging out in the morning, waiting for our classes to start when we get asked by our dean to meet him in his office.  We assume he's going to ask us to help him file paperwork or something.  The thought that we our janitor had ratted us out didn't even cross our minds. 

All of Friday was one big fustercluck of meetings with our dean, our college counselor, and our principal.  Culminating at the end of the day with our parent-meetings.

The short of it is, that all of them were not angry at us.  Just disappointed and ashamed.  In my gf's parent meeting she divulged what we had done... everything we had done. 

I was threatened with suspension, with expulsion, even arrest (luckily she was honest and made it clear that the act was consensual and mutual).

The only repercussions are that I am now strictly prohibited from making any form of contact (physical or otherwise) with my girlfriend while on campus, for the rest of the year.  Both of us are barred from any senior activities, and the worst of it is, I have to face all of my teachers (who undoubtedly have been told the entire thing by now) tomorrow.

Keepsitreal_c93,16,4,1nepcb,38,"I'll be the first to admit, I've never been in a fight. Ever. I don't like confrontation. Which is probably why I got bullied a lot in high school, I never want to escalate things. But last night I got fed up. 

It was 1 am and myself and a friend of mine were riding the bus home from a concert (iron &amp; wine, such a great concert). When a group of clearly underage drunks came on the bus. They began to do what any normal group of idiots on a bus would do, which is not know if the bus they are getting on is the right one and not have enough money for it anyways. The driver lets them on as my friend and  I glance down to see what the hell was taking so long.

That's when the private pyle looking thug of the group came over to my friend and started yelling about ""why ya starin' at me bro"" and ""you wan to go"". Me and my friend stare back silently enraged as he begins to go onto the natural progression of any drunk confrontation, spout homophobia (I'm not gay and I wouldn't care if someone sincerely asked me if I was, it just grinds my gears that people resort to it in the form of an insult). He continues on his train of thought about beating and dick sucking, when he says ""when you get off, I'm going to come after you"", at which point I say ""I'll just be getting off on your mom later.""

Remember when I said that I hadn't gotten in a fight before? Well, if I had gotten in a fight before I would probably know that it is difficult to defend yourself when you're sitting down and the other person is standing in front of you with their arms already up.

[deleted],7,5,1nei4v,20,"Went on a hiking trip today with several people from work, including one of my best friends.  It's all fun driving up the mountain, but then we start actually hiking and it became clear that the ""trail"" was actually about a 45 degree, mile long climb.  That's a problem.

You see, I'm fat.  Originally weighed about 400, currently down to about 350, but still fat.  And after less than 10 minutes it's pretty clear that this hill might just give me a coronary.  So we paused for a minute, and I made some joke about being too fat for hiking and told them to go on.  They offered to let me set the pace, but I was already incredibly embarrassed and didn't want to make things worse by going up the mountain at a crawl holding all of them back (and I'm not sure I could have even made it to the top in any reasonable time).  One of them offered to stay with me, but again I told them to go on.

So, off they went, and I climbed a bit more until I found a decent overlook, and sat down there.  And I sat there for an hour, waiting for them to come back.  An hour, stewing in the embarrassment of being too fat to keep up.  An hour, revisiting the self loathing towards my fat self that I've felt for a long time.  For the first 30 minutes or so I was very depressed, then I started getting angry.  Mainly at myself, but hey, anger has a way of flowing out.

Eventually they came back and asked me how things were, and I responded with a snide comment about staring the mountains being the best day of my life.  Walked back down in silence, got in the car to drive home, and then the ""fun"" really began.  The road up to the parking spot was a long, curvy, dirt road, and I was flying down it at breakneck speed, trying to take some of my anger out on the car.  Nobody said anything, but maybe that's because I somehow managed to avoid killing us all.

After we got back on the normal highways my driving somewhat went back to normal, but I still sat there staring at the road and not saying a word, ignoring the few comments that were made in my direction.  30 minutes later though, by the time we were getting back to civilization, I started feeling guilty about acting like a dick.

We went to the grocery store to because we were going to get supplies for dinner.  I had a minute with my friend, and asked her something to the effect of how much of an asshole I had been acting like.  She of course replied that I had been one, and I tried to say something about how I'd spent an hour hating myself, and... nothing.  She didn't say a word.  Well damn.  I'm not sure was I was really expecting, but I was hoping for some kind of expression of concern or sympathy or whatever.

Well, that silence gave me a one way ticket to the black pit.  I took them all back to the house of the guy hosting, told my friend to find another ride home (she was supposed to come with me), and left.  I got home and stewed for a few minutes before sending my friend an angry text about how she'd ignored me.  Well, she said that she'd replied that I shouldn't feel that way about myself and I had never answered.  I honestly never heard her say anything, but she does speak softly sometimes so I could have easily missed it.  I sent more angry replies, she sent some angry replies, and though I did finally realize how stupid I was being and sent a sort of apologetic message, she hasn't replied in over an hour now.

A few months ago my girlfriend of over a year ago attempted to kill herself by taking every pill (over 100) she had. After she OD'd, she sent out a mass goodbye text and called me. I called an ambulance and she ended up in the hospital for two weeks. I visited her everyday and at first it was really horrid because she couldn't talk and she spent 90% of the time crying, trying to say something, or sleeping. It sucked. Anyways the whole suicide thing taught me that life is short and ends unexpectedly, and this, of course, inspired me to do dumbass stuff just because. After her two weeks in the hospital she was sent to a mental hospital for two more weeks. I personally think that she should have been there for longer but there really wasn't anything I could do about that situation. She came back and on her birthday I borrowed my parents car in the middle of the night and visited her. I don't have my drivers license. That was my first time driving on a road. I had to drive twenty minutes to get to her house. She was sleeping outside in a tent because the cabin her family was renting was horribly tiny. I entered the tent and woke her up. We talked, kissed, cuddled, and had sex. It was the first time both of us had had sex. It was okay. After that I drove back to my house and went to sleep. Then the next night I did it again, and I did it the night after that. On the last night of my adventure I got arrested. I didn't tell her I got arrested. I got pulled over for not stopping entirely before turning on a steady red. It was horrible. I was put in the back of a police car and my parents were called. thankfully I wasn't put in jail but I had to court in a month ish. Flash forward a month ish and I just got out of court. Me and my girlfriend broke up because she wanted an open relationship and I didn't. She was about to move to another state for the winter so I met up with her right after I got out of court. We talk and stuff. Then she tells me she missed her period. Her period was missed. By eight days. We talk about it and stuff. She's getting a pregnancy test today. I hate myself. I never used to be like this. I might of just ruined her and mine's life. I hate myself for everything. I'm the worst child my parents know. I'm 16 and I might be having a child. I'm really afraid that people in her other state are going to call her a whore and a slut. I wish this never happened. I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm crying now. Bye.

FredTheDerp,7,12,1ne3e0,4,"It's a beautiful day outside so I decided maybe it would be a good day to go into the woods and chill by the creek. I grab my machete and backpack and decide to go through the woods on my property. Due to the thick foliage of my woods I use my machete in order to clear a path, since the path isn't exactly set in such a way that I can travel back easily. I have to climb over stuff in order to get back to the creek. 

So while i'm hacking away at branches and various plants to clear a path, I must have stepped on some sort of insect nest. I felt something sting the back of my neck and it left a sharp pain, something stung my arm as well. It took me a few seconds to realize I had been stung by something. I backed away and screamed ""SHIT!"" and then took off running. I had a quick glance of what these insects were, which I believe were either bees or some kind of hornet. I'm not 100% sure, which is why I put ""insect nest"" in the title. I didn't stick around to find out since I had already been stung twice.

After I get back home my neck and arm were starting to sting. I took some pain meds and checked for stingers, there were no stingers so I guess I'm okay for now. I'm not having an allergic reaction otherwise I wouldn't be here typing this. I put some ointment on the stings as well, which has helped a little bit. As of right now, I fucking hate hornets/bees.

The pizza guy had been ditzing around on my street for 20 minutes because I gave the wrong building number and it's fucking raining!

I get back, rain soaked, into my apartment and try sending my savior a message apologizing for being a dumb fuck and no response.

She likes to talk about these problems A LOT.

Today she decided she didn't ""feel like eating"" and she decided to talk about it the whole fucking day. She had to mention this every half hour or so to each of the 4 other roommates, and ask stuff like ""Is it weird that i'm not hungry? I haven't eaten since breakfast. I hope I don't die or something haha""

I said ""Look. It's college. The great thing about college is that no one makes you do anything. Eat when you want to. Don't eat when you don't to. If you want to die, DIE."" 

and she said something like ""haha wow that got really dark really fast..."" and I instantly felt like the biggest bitch ever. I don't even really know what to say. I'm still pissed at her, and I still think she's annoying as hell, but I also think what I said what pretty awful.

As we were preparing a barbecue, I asked her if she would be interested in trying weed if it was legal. I thought it wouldn't be bad asking that, since she's a teacher and quite open minded. I was WRONG.

She became so upset and automatically thought I was a /dealer/ and told me that she would tell my dad. I tried to calm her the fuck down, and I told her I eventually enjoy smoking it, but that I didn't sell it, for God's sake. At least, I'm not going to jail...

AlifonatreeinMarch,0,7,1nbucs,9,"This technically happened yesterday, but thanks to our fine healthcare system, I was in the emergency room for longer than I expected.

It's Rush Week for my fraternity, and tensions are high since we just chartered the last year and for our first Alpha pledge class, we wanted to hit the ground running. Our events were ambitious. Wednesday night was ""Havana Nights"", where we roasted an entire pig that would be served to our prospective new members. The second night was filled with the hissing of deep fat fryers and liquid nitrogen going to town on various food stuffs, like Twinkies, Oreos, and In-n-Out burgers.

I heard these events were fun. I wasn't able to fully attend either because of work and late evening classes. It really bummed me out. 

Friday night was Chili Cook-off night. Three brothers went head to head to head to see which chili came out on top. Since I was no longer tied down by a work shift and all my classes were cancelled that day, I readily volunteered to help with the set up. I laid out a couple tables and some propane burners, and now I was waiting for the chili to arrive.

Two chili dishes came prepared and ready to go. One, however, needed to be prepared at the event, which, in retrospect, probably wasn't the best idea since the dish ended up losing anyways.

The cook who was preparing his chili there asked for assistance, so I jumped right in, trying to make up for lost time at the other events. Boom. Beef in the frying pan. Slice and dice. Jalapeños in the pot. I was feeling confident in my abilities as I grabbed some bell peppers and started chopping.

This was definitely a bad move. I guess I wasn't focused as I should have been, and what with the rush, I ended up nearly chopping off the tip of my finger. I sat there for a second before thinking, ""Fuck. Shit. Fuck."" Eventually my thoughts were verbalized and the brothers who were dicking around waiting for the event to actually start realized something was wrong. Blood started to flow, but by this time I was standing over a trash can asking for ice and something to hold back the flow until I got a ride to the emergency room, which was a 5 minuted drive away.

What I found surprising about this whole thing was that I barely felt any pain. Part of the nail went with the tip, and it was a slightly diagonal cut, but it didn't take out too much flesh. 

After about a 4 hour wait, I got out of the ER with ten stitches and a metal brace to keep my clumsy self from bouncing the finger around too much. Everything should heal nicely, but only time will tell.

aaronthebaron27,68,274,1nb4j7,710,"Quick back story. I've known the family for a few years now, every summer and easter break I've been working for them at a kids camp since I was 16 (now 21) they've become more like friends in a lot of ways and the eldest daughter and I have been fond of each other for a while. Fast forward and the daughter and I have now been an item for two years. (drunken hook-up WIN)

So...like every guy courting a girl, I visit the family for the first time, not as a friend but, as a boyfriend. Her mum has loved me for a while now and is incredibly optimistic about it and her dad is simply acknowledging this 'thing'. He's one of these all round great guys, funny, level headed etc but obviously has to keep a bit of a distance when a boyfriend appears on the scene to pluck away one of his three daughters.
The relationship with the family continues pretty much the same for the duration of us being together, mum loves me, sisters love me and dad LIKES me. Which, again, is fair. We have our banter from time to time, take little digs and he know's I'm a huge admirer of his stories. This guy has an ability to turn simple things into the most hilarious antics. He's a master of timing and wit. He's a big guy, 7ft odd, big broad scottish accent and whenever he tells a story he just captivates everyone with his signature smile and winking at people to let them know shits about to go down - meaning he'll be retelling a time of when he has annoyed his wife.

(went off on a tangent there - not so quick background)

So visiting now and again I started to notice that her mum was introducing me to people as 'A friend and a camp helper' Rather than 'Katies boyfriend' which, again, is fine. I was a friend before that but I jokingly bring it up one time at the table and we had a laugh about it.

So, it's summer. I'm back in the small village, where the camp is, where I grew up and where all my high school friends are for the summer break and it's the local festival. It was the Saturday where everything peaks and in the evening everybody heads to the one and only village pub. My friends and I had a barbecue at lunch and so we were well on our way to being more than a little drunk when we stumbled to the pub to meet our other friends. Of course, my girlfriends dad is there. The whole village is, everyone is rubbing up against each other in this tiny pub talking away. I know I'm completely wasted and try my best to avoid eye contact but the only way to get to the rest of our mob was to go past him and hope he didn't want to talk to me. He plucked me as we were walking and this is how it happened.

Gfs Dad : 'Aaron!!! It's good to see you, can I introduce you to my friend Laura?'
Me: 'Hey, good to meet you.'
Gfs Dad: 'This is Katies man friend' 
Laura: 'ha, good to meet you'
I was already a tad uncomfortable but...
Gfs Dad: 'Or should I say...the boy who's shagging Katie!'
This is when it hit me. I have genuinely never been so speechless. It was like one of those movie scenes where a dude is about to get run over and his life flashes in front of him but instead of my life it was every time I had had sex with this guys daughter! In her bed, in my bed, in the shower...all flashing in front of me and I'm just standing dumb struck, Laura's cackling and the Dad is looking at me with this big beaming smile, eyes fixed and looking for an answer. He's touched upon something I feel should go unspoken between a man and his daughters bf and here he is bringing it up!
Me: 'Well...yeah...ahu...' 
I was dumbstruck and yet he was still looking at me for a genuine answer. So, as any drunken idiot in that position would do, I mustered up some words I knew I would regret and said 'I do it well' Meeting his eyes. I stared right at the floor after that and walked away.

A couple of days later I popped by to see her and had to wait a little for her to come home so I sat in the living room watching television, her dad came in and we both stared at the tv in silence.

Okay, now for the story.  As we're drinking, Emily and I are getting more and more flirty, and then we decide to go get more booze.  After doing some walking around, we finally are able to locate a liquor store and we buy some vodka.  We bring it back to my place and take a shot, which I accidentally chased with a mixed drink.  That's when I decided I was done drinking and Emily said she was tired so I walked her the 3 blocks back to her apartment.  We hug goodbye and I stumble my ass back home.

She put a lot of butter on it, and Im no stranger to pot, but I got right ripped. While I was at work. I got so sick and when asked what was wrong I said, Im my friend played a prank on me and now Im high.

I don't know about you but I prefer text messaging (Especially over the god awful apps for the iPhone) 

She had been visiting family somewhere in Europe and made a point to tell me that she was unable to text due to the international text fees or whatever

This is where I fucked up..

I convince the girl to use iMessage to chat with me because it won't cost anything only I didn't think it through that this girl isn't very technical and has very little understanding of how iPhone's work 

What I didn't realize is that her mother also has an iPhone and is also linked to the iMessage account..for the people without iPhone's I will explain this simply..when I text the girl MOM also gets the text too.

She obliged to the texting and we began talking regularly for a while which ended up evolving into full on sexting. I was excited and decided it would be a good time to send a nude photo like a moron.

After sending the photo she stopped replying but I could see that she didn't read it so I figured she must have just fallen asleep

Fast forward to the next morning (Today) I get a call from an odd number I've never seen before. Of course I don't answer it because it's probably just spam. I end up getting a [voicemail which ended up being this](https://soundcloud.com/throwawaysext/0292-1)

The girl was mortified. I was mortified. I was immediately unfriended and blocked and I don't expect to hear from her again. Total awkwardness.

mindspew,93,284,1n7fsf,780,"I am so sorry.

 
I am late 20’s, 5’7”, lean with muscles, getting nicely drunk at a house party that I don’t know the hosts, or their friends. But I was invited by a stranger at the first party I was at... I rolled in with no beers as I had no money but really, there’s almost always extra beers at the middle of the evening, right? I am happy, outgoing and looking forward to meeting new chicks.

 
I don’t remember much about you (lots and lots to drink) but your robust drinking style makes up for any otherwise dealbreakers as I eye-lock you across the crowded kitchen. I am at the fridge, I open it up and grab 4 bottles of beer, signaling to you to meet me at the other side of the kitchen island to pick up your fresh beer.

 
When after fighting through tightly packed bodies I find you making your way to the meeting spot… I realize it’s going to be a very exciting night for you and me; you like beer. I smile at you and hand you a bottle. Looking at my other hand you ask where those beers are going? I reply with a smirk that maybe I’m feeling thirsty. You tell me the price to meet you and talk with you is 2 beers and I had better hand over another bottle immediately. Actually, I was planning to feed you another beer but didn’t think you would want to know that intention up front.

 
Sweet! You can hold onto your own stash! We talk, argue, smile and both continue to drink like prohibition begins tomorrow. Soon I’m forging back into the kitchen to rescue the remaining 2 bottles out of the bottom drawer where I hid them earlier, fully annihilating the expensive designer 6-pack that was never mine to drink. This party has real adults, in their 30’s, that buy the good shit, unlike the post-college party I started at.

 
Blackout. Yeah really. Can’t remember anymore at the party, aaaaaaaaandd not really sure how we left and how we ended up at, your place. Yep, your place. That’s where it happens. I think we begin sex, but not sure we finish, either of us. Maybe I fell asleep on top of you and you enjoyed this passive cuddling?

 
I wake up in a panic. I have to pee. NOW!

 
F#ck. I’m in some strange house, you brought me here in the dark and didn’t turn on any lights as you led me into your lair…. I’m so f#cked. I have no idea where the f#ck I am. I have no idea where your bathroom is!! I NEED TO PEE!!!!

 
You keep your bedroom ultrabrutal tidy, some OCD I’m sure. Maybe your binge drinking is an effort to balance the obvious control issues? But it’s cool because I’m in pain I’m trying so hard not to pee as I stand up in bed to walk off the end and onto the floor. Thank god there’s nothing out of place on the floor in the dark for me to twist an ankle.

 
I think I’ve just sprained my stop-pee muscle; I have never been in this type of pain! I can’t do it. I can’t. There is no way I can wander about your house naked, with many housemates in many rooms, searching for the bathroom with the toilet, continuing to hold back the tsunami of urea and uric acid and nitrogenous wastes. Fml.

 
The urine is now backing up, backing up up up into my brain. My brain is full of urine. I can’t think. I want to cry, moan, I want to sob hysterically. This is pain that morphine and fentanyl in no way can block, no way.

 
I see your closet door. I hobble the long 3-feet to the door and open it. It’s pitch black inside your closet, nothing. I need to let this tidal wave out, now! I am drunk, please remember this; I likely have a Blood Alcohol Concentration of over 0.250 and by that I mean a lot! I am soooooo drunk, and asleep! I need to piss like yesterday, I am mad drunk and completely unconscious as I stand teetering naked at your open closet.
 

And, I, pee.

 
This doesn’t seem too bad. I mean, it’s completely dark, I can’t see a thing, there’s nothing inside this closet? It’s empty? I am peeing. Much better to piss a little inside an empty closet rather than pee all over your bedroom. Ohhhhhhhhhh, yes, I am peeing.

 
Still peeing full force I totter a little bit inside the closet. Shit, there are shoes on the floor, lots of shoes, all over the floor. Peeing feels so good, nothing could feel better than complete surrender. I am peeing all over the floor, all over the shoes all over the floor. I cannot stop. This is going down.

 
Then I get a good idea. If I pee in one spot then I’ll completely soak and ruin whatever is there, but if I swing all around, if I pee a little here, a little there, a little over there……. Yes, that’s consideration. I am a considerate one-night stand and I’m no amateur at drinking and dating. I got this.

 
So I begin to swivel my hips and let it fly where ever it may go, in the pitch blackness. I do my best to move my stream, never too long in one spot. I feel good, I am working a plan, with kindness and compassion in my heart, I pee a solid unending stream of hot stinky urine. And then I realize that I don’t need to pee only on the floor, I can also spread it over the blouses hanging on the low rod and the things in piles on low shelves. If each item gets just a little spray then nothing is ruined. She might not even notice.

 
I pee. I pee. I pee. This will never end. I am getting tired with this work. I stop swiveling my hips, I think I’m going to throwup. I remain still, and keep peeing. Playfully I do a thing that all men and boys know, I tilt my hips backward and arch the stream upward. I figure I’ll try to tag some high targets before the peak force of my pee wanes. Just spreading my work out, trying to not ruin any one thing.

 
Peeing. Slowing down, now. Slowing down. Feels good to finish this load. Felt like about a quart. Yep, that is certainly possible when a man drinks a f#ckton of beer. A full hot oily quart of fresh piss.

 
Done. I swagger back to bed and feel like sexytime but also feel like celebration will bring my stomach up thru my mouth, so I gently slide back into bed. I try to swallow some water from your Nalgene sport bottle but my insides don’t want that. Well, they probably do but I fear I’ll puke immediately. And I crash.

 
Gotta pee!!! I open my eyes, it’s barely getting light out, your windows are large and have no curtains or blinds on them. I see you sleeping facedown, have no idea what your face looks like. Can’t remember from just 5 hours earlier at the party. My head hurts, and I gotta pee. I gently stand up in bed and walk over to the edge and step down to the floor, your room is so clean. I grab my pants and put them on in awkward struggle as I move to your bedroom door. I find the bathroom just immediately down the hall, and I pee. I don’t flush because I’m considerate and don’t want to make noise so early in the pre-dawn morning.

 
As I re-enter your room I look over at the closet. Oh yeah, that weird dream….. that was really f#cked up! But…..  and I walk over to the closet, put my head inside, and wait. AHHH F#CK!!!!!!!!!! It smells like a f#cking rat cage!!!!! Nasty urine. EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!
 

Hurrying with fear I pick up my shirt and snatch my shoes from beneath your bed. F#ck my socks? I really don’t give a shit about them at this moment. My undwear too! Don’t need it!!!!!

 
I quickly lope out your bedroom door, shirtless. I cruise down the hallway, down the stairs, it’s getting lighter outside. The stairs are creaky 1920’s wooden but speed is my defense, I must keep moving fast. I must evacuate, now! I can’t seem to figure out which path is the shortest to the front door. I can’t see the front door but I can sense where it should be. F#ck it, I’ll navigate the back of the house, I’ll go out the backdoor.
 
Goddamnit! I have no idea where I am and no idea how to get out of this hell hole!!!

 
I run to the left and then forward, finding the front door. I stress out, freaking that maybe it’s a keylock deadbolt that needs a f#cking goddamned key to unlock from the inside! F#ck f#ck f#ck f#ckitty F#CK!!~!!!

 
Spin two small knobs, unlock the door, grab the handle, push it open…. and escape in my pants no underwear, with shoes and shirt in hand. And I run!!!!!!!!

 
I knew nobody at that party where we met. I only knew about that party by a stranger I met at the prior party. But you don’t know any of that. I can’t recall your freakin name! Maybe you’ve forgot mine? As I run away I take great pains to avoid looking at any street signs, I want to get 10 blocks away in any direction before I learn where the f#ck I am. I want no reason to ever ever ever stroll past your house….. just to look……

 
Eventually, I look at a street sign and learn that I’m somewhere on Capitol Hill, but totally no clue just exactly where and really not the first clue on how to efficiently begin walking home. No matter; presently lost, 6 miles of walking in the light rain in a cotton short sleeve shirt, no socks….. this is the easy party. This is easy. I can do this.

 
Escaping that hell hole of a house with a closet putrifying from 1 quart of hot oily urine sprayed all over every single item……  that was the hard part. Escape. Success.

The next part is fiction, at least, I have no way of knowing what actually happens but I’ll do my best to paint a realistic epilogue.

 
You wake up, face down, your head hurts when you turn it. You may or may not remember “me” from last night at the party. You may or may not remember “me” from last night inside your body. It’s light out, but there’s no sunshine ‘cuz this is Fall in Seattle so it’s raining. Of course.

 
A little bit later you do remember “me” and you remember “me” in all the ways there are to remember. A smile comes to your face, but slips off when you look about your bed, then you look about your room and you don’t find “me.” You instantly consider me a thoughtless dick, in all senses of that phrase. I ducked out after our one-nighter without even a cute note. I leave no trace to ever being there.

 
Your head hurts but you know from your solid career of binge drinking that a glass of Emergen-C with painkillers followed by some herbal tea will be your friends in recovery. You step out of bed and see my socks on the floor by the side of the bed and my underwear hanging from a shitty sculpture you made in highschool but still can’t seem to get rid of. You’ve no idea how or better yet why my worn-out and centerline-stained underwear are hanging from your art?

 
“Maybe he’s still here? Maybe he’s making tea for me? Maybe he’s cooking a sweet country breakfast and using any food he finds in the frig I share with 4 passive aggressive bitchy girls?”

 
You walk over naked to your closet. You open the door. You reach inside to get your comfy robe. You grab your robe and put it on.

 
The overfull and cloistered closet smells like your 10-gallon fish tank when you were in junior highschool and had 6 mice after the original fish residents all died from lack of care. Your closet smells like 4 homeless men have used it as a common urination spot for several months.

 
WHAT THE F#CK!!!!!!!!!

Honestly, I can’t even begin to imagine what you must have thought, felt, endured from my actions. The questions you have will NEVER have any answer that is safe and reasonable.
 

“Who in the F#CK was that guy that picked me up, f#cked me (or not?), and then after I fell asleep he creeped out of bed and sprayed 2-gallons of oily stinky potty urine on everything I own??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Who does that??!! WHY ME?????!!!!!!!!!!!”
 

I. 

Am.

Sorry.
 

This happened nearly exactly 20 years ago, in Seattle, on Capitol Hill. I have finally felt the need to attempt to apologize, in some form. I have suppressed this memory, I have not thought about it. But today 2013 the entire memory was completely unearthed, no longer suppressed under a bedrock of denial.
 

I am so so sorry. So sorry.

So I have an athletic competition this weekend, so I'm trying to hydrate well this entire week. Yesterday, I drank two Gatorade bottles of water (64 ounces) in the last hour and a half of the workday. I had an event downtown, about a one-hour drive in traffic, and I drove off not suspecting anything, and I didn't bother to empty the bladder before leaving work. 

By the time I got close to downtown, I was feeling the effects of the water, and I needed to piss. Badly. Well, it turns out, parking is a bitch downtown, and as expected, there were no spaces available near where I was going, nor could I just get out and pee in a bush because there were cops all around and public urination apparently causes you to become a sex offender.

You know there's that tipping point between having to pee and HAVING to pee? If you don't (and if you said that you don't, then you're lying), imagine a dam. It's holding the water back, as more and more water builds up. Then, it leaks just a little bit, as a warning that it's about to burst. That's where I was. Finally, I walked into a McDonalds, and lo and behold, it's an area where there are a lot of homeless people, so the bathrooms are locked and you have to insert a token to open the door. I went to the front, ready to burst, and asked for a token, and she said it was open. Tried the door again. No luck. Someone was in there. Next to the door, however, there was one of those janitor buckets filled with dirty water, and I was in a fairly secluded corner of the restaurant. There was a small but noticeable wet spot on my pants at this point, so I made a decision and dropped trou and went, just enough so that I could hold the rest back while whoever was in that bathroom was taking his sweet time. 

I zipped my pants the guy finally emerges. It was a McDonalds worker, presumably cleaning the bathroom. ""Sorry, sir,"" he said in a Hispanic accent. He took his mop and put it in the bucket where I just went, and carried on cleaning the floors, none the wiser. I rushed into the bathroom, finished my business, and walked out in shame as quickly as I could, but not before noticing the security camera pointed right at the bathroom doors. I had my back to it the whole time, at least, so my junk wasn't on camera for all (or at least all employees) to see.

SchmuckBuddha,2,9,1n6x89,0,"During my Jackass days as I like to call them, I made plenty of dumb mistakes while continually putting myself at risk and in harm’s way. One time during a my speech class in high school, we spent the entire period in our schools batting cages. While there I came up with a crazy idea: position myself in front of home plate like Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore and let WILD PITCHES WHIZ BY ME AT SPEEDS CLOSE TO 60 MILES-PER-HOUR. I walked into the batting cages, stood in front of home plate, and faced the pitching machine head on. Swiftly baseballs began flying out at me as I maneuvered out of the way while they HIGHTAIL past me. Thinking to myself that I might go belly up and meet my maker, I re-evaluated the situation just as one more ball came barreling past me almost taking my head clear off. Through with this insanity, I jumped out of the way to safety, but I didn’t have any idea what would happen to me next. One of my classmates pushed me back into the batting cage timing it precisely, so an out-of-control baseball would come flying out at me at the exact time I would fall in front of home base. That’s exactly what occurred, A BALL LAUNCHED OUT OF THE MACHINE AND CLOBBERED ME RIGHT IN THE TESTICLES (NUT SHOT TO THE WORST POSSIBLE DEGREE)! I took a nosedive hitting the ground in excruciating pain; it felt as if Paul Bunyan just kicked me square in the nuts with a steel-toed boot. My teacher immediately pulled the plug and rushed to my aid. While on the ground, I looked at the kid who pushed me and whimpered, “When I can get up off the ground, you better run. I will get you if it’s the last thing I do—SCUMBAG!” That was the last time I ever did something of that dumb nature, I nearly lost my testicles—gee whiz I say old boy.

itwonthappentome,60,44,1n629n,178,"This all started about 3 weeks ago, with a visit to the dentist. My lower wisdom tooth was causing problems, so after an initial consult, they booked me in to have it, and another removed. They advised that I should be sedated, but it was my choice. I declined as I didn't want to inconvenience anyone by having them drive me to the appointment - big mistake!

They were removed on Monday about lunch time. The amount of pain I experienced as soon as the numbing injections wore off was the worst I have ever experienced. I scurried to the nearest pharmacy to get my prescribed drugs, immediately sunk two 40mg codine, and with a death grip on the wheel I got home and collapsed on the couch for the rest of the afternoon. Codine makes you very sleepy, which is great, as I wasn't up to facing the world anyway.

The next few days were more of the same, Tues - codine, soup, sleep and repeat. Wed - codine, soup and bit of bread, sleep and repeat. By Thursday, I was eating almost normally and had managed to cut down my worrying dependency on codine to just night time, so I decided I should go back to work.

I work casually for an agricultural company, collecting soil samples, when I'm not working on our own farm. I was overdue to collect samples 1.5 hours away, at two different locations, so I set off.

I wandered thru the first few fields collecting samples, enjoying myself immensely, it was a beautiful sunny day, warm but not hot, just perfect, and after being stuck on the couch for 2.5 days it was just what I felt like. 

I got to the 5th field, and felt a pressure on my sphincter. I ignored the pressure for a bit, but it got worse. The pressure built and built. All of a sudden, a flash back ""Codine may cause constipation."" ""OMG the last time I had a poo? When was it? I haven't had one since before Monday!!! This is not going to be good!""

I begin to run thru my options, making it to the car was out of the question, too far away. I spy a woolshed, as a was on a dairy farm it was a safe bet it had long been deserted. I hurry over there hoping for some kind of toilet, as this stage I wasn't being fussy, I long drop would have seemed luxurious. No such luck, no holes in the ground anywhere. I look around the abandoned sheep yards, and find myself in a wee thicket of overgrown woody weeds, thick enough that barring close inspection, I should be out of sight while dealing with my codine consequence. There was also a handy patch of dock leaves there.

I down pants and begin to bear down. I was thinking since it had been awhile since my previous number 2, it would be pooping of the explosive diarrhea kind. Boy was I wrong.

It was diamond hard, it was huge, it was chodelike. Much, much, much bearing down had only just got a wee point out. My legs were getting sore from squatting -  I started hearing cars on the nearby roads, and thinking they were on the farm approaching me.

Things had to hurry along! I starting thinking outside the square... ""A dock leave glove over my finger to somehow wedge it out?"" No it was shy and kept going back in. Thighs getting really sore... ""Ok shuffle over to that broken rail with pants down and wee point hanging out and sit on broken rail for some much needed added stability. That's better, ok well there's not help for  it, bearing down and forcing it out is really the only option open to us.""

With tears in my eyes, and a tear in my sphincter I bore down with the strength I possessed in that area. The pain, the pain, worse that the wisdom teeth removal, by a long shot. So bad reddit, so bad. 

But eventually it moved, then slid, ever so slowly and painfully out. It was massive 5cm in diameter at least, all the way down its 15cm length. It was lumpy, it had a bits of corn and it was bloody. It was followed by little diamond hard nuggets. 

I cleaned myself up as best as I could with the dock leaves, and I carried on with my day, promising myself to never again take that much codine ever.

I don't know if I'll ever be the same.",I never thought it would happen to me... but TIFU.,222
ultrafilthy,7,26,1n61d3,16,"Well it was lasyt night. 
Anywho,  we weren at the bar and I go to the bathroom to pee after a few beers. The urinals were full so I go to a stall. I going pee and I see an empty glass on top of the toilet. So, for a reason unknown to myself I blast that fucker with beer colored piss and put it right back. 

Later on I go back to the same stall and the glass was empty. Now I can't say for sure it was my friend, BUT I all of the sudden realize upon seeing the empty glass that my friend will sometimes drink wounded strangers (rando, beer unclaimed). So I ask him about it and he immediatly goes ""no way dude of course not."" I doubt he would man up to the truth, but im prettty sure if not him, someone at that bar drank my piss.

cking137,6,3,1n5qdo,0,"We broke up two months ago, and it was not a good break up... It was a long distance relationship but I loved her with all my heart and believed when she said she was in for the long haul. Then she cheated on me and started a relationship with the new guy. 

For some reason I have tried to keep a friendship with her. I still love her and I hate the idea of totally losing her from my life. For some stupid reason I looked at her Facebook page to see a message about her bf buying her dinner and how he is the ""best bf ever"" and that she loves him. I had been doing ok...but now I feel sick. She is all happy and I am alone and sad. It was really really stupid and I am back to square one with the break up.

Disloyalcarrot,2,2,1n5pj2,10,"Well technically it was Saturday (Or I suppose Sunday if you're one of those assholes who says ""Anything after midnight is the next day"", no fuck you its until I go to sleep asswipe""). So before we get into exactly what I did you're going to need some background information, because this isn't going to be some shitty TIFU post, no its going to be good (because I done bad). 
      
 So its Saturday morning, and I wake up at my house, home from college for the weekend. I'm super pumped because I have a date in a few hours with a girl who goes to another college which is only about forty minutes away from mine. Now this might not sound like a big deal to most of you, I mean who cares its only one date right? WRONG! This is the first date I've EVER been on. Yes with anyone (I hope you're getting all excited right now like ""Dis gon be good""). Anyway so the time comes and I get a ride down there from my parents who were going down there anyway. So they drop me off and leave, alls good and well. I text her tell her shes there and she comes down. Now at this point I'm sitting in the lobby, nervous as hell because 1) I've never been on a date and 2) I don't actually know exactly how attractive this girl is because I've only met her once. She comes down and I'm caught totally offguard because shes fucking gorgeous, and I'm like ""err Hi"" (beautiful I know). Anyway we go out to lunch at a really well known restaurant that's pretty cheap, and it goes ok. It had like this feeling of awkward because I'm 99% sure it was both of our first dates ever. Anyway like I said it goes ok, I insist on paying the bill because I'm a male therefore I must, and we leave. 
           
 At this point we go back to her dorm and just hang out. I see some guys I know and we all hang out and everything goes well. As time goes on everything starts to get better and better. I'm relaxed at this point so I'm making jokes, people are laughing, its all good. Then some guy comes up and is like ""Yo lets go pregame this party that we're all going to tonight."" Now this isn't that big of a deal for me, I was going anyway so why not drink. Well for starters I'm fucking 150 pounds and secondly I may or may not be under 21. But YOLO I like alcohol why not. So me, this girl, and like 3-4 of her friends go to this dudes room and pregame. Pretty much everyone has like 3-4 shots, except me, because I'm going to impress this girl. So instead of having a few shots, I have fucking ten, in about 15 minutes. So as you can imagine I'm fucking trashed.

 At this point we all start hanging out, and everything is still going reasonably well, I'm positive that there will be a second date. A few hours pass, not much happens, and then we go out. We walk for fucking ever and I'm still pretty trashed, though I haven't drank anything since so I'm doing alright. We end up at some random house with nothing but Jungle Juice. Now I'm not a big drinker, so I don't know exactly what jungle juice is, but me being both drunk and out to impress has 3 full SOLO cups full. Yeah you're probably cringing right now because either you have  taste buds and you're like ""Who the fuck could ever have more than one glass of that shit"", or if you're not so lucky you're just thinking ""Ok this kids fucked."" Well we stay out for about 3 hours and I'm feeling SHITTY. I end up sitting on some porch by myself just like ""aww shit this is bad I'm feeling awful."" After about what turns out to have been 45 minutes of this I see 4-5 people leaving, including the now much more attractive girl (beer goggles) who I had been on a date with earlier. So I get up, suppress the urge to fucking vomit EVERYWHERE, and walk with them back to their lobby. On the way back she's chatting with another guy, which I honestly didn't care about in the least, and I'm just following the group. But when we're almost there she says ""Hey could you get someone else to sign you in I think I'm just going to go up to my room and go to bed."". I say its fine, but in reality that fucked me really hard because the other person who normally signs me in is hooking up with some chick in his room. So she leaves, and I go and sit down in the lobby. 

 I text him twice, and he answers that he'll be down eventually. As I sit there I progressively get worse and worse, until its inevitable that I'm going to puke. So I stand up, get hit with a wave of nauseate so intense I think I'm going to die, casually walk over to a trashcan, and to the dismay of twenty people lose my stomach into a trashcan. After about 2-3 bouts of this someone who I'd met earlier in the day walks over with a waterbottle and tells me that she went and got my friend. I stand there, thank her profusely and down the water bottle. At this point I'm not totally sure whats going on, but she guides me over to a chair and tells me to sit down, which I drunkenly manage to do. At this point I close my eyes in the chair, and when I open them again I see two of the RA's for the dorm standing there talking. One of them asks me if I have an ID, which I am somehow able to conjure up. I close my eyes again and this time when I open them I see three cops, my friend, the two RA's, and out of the corner of my eye the girl who I went on a date with. FUCK!!! I ask if I can move further into the lobby so she can't see me, and they allow it.
 
 The cops look at the id, and proceed to ask my a number of questions that are never good such as ""What is your name"" and ""How old are you"". After about three minutes of this one of the cops asks me ""Alright Daniel, how old are you?"" to which I reply ""I'm 19"". He then asks ""And what is the legal drinking age in this state?"" At this point I'm just thinking that I'm totally fucked in every way possible, but I answer that it is ""21 sir"". The cop then goes on to say ""Now Daniel, if you were to apply for a job in ten years, and you have an underage, and your friend here applies for the same job without an underage, who do you think will get the job."" Annnnnnnnnnd I'm fucked. But I still answer the question in the most professional way I'm capable of at this point which is ""Well sir, I'm not totally sure, but if I had to guess I'd say my boy over here is going to get the job, but I think he would anyway cause he's Asian."" The cop at this point is suppressing a laugh, because that is a pretty fucking stupid thing to say. So he hands me my ID and says ""Ok since you sound coherent and you don't have the ""stumbly umblies"" (That's a direct fucking quote) I'm gonna let you off with a warning."" At this point I'm shocked and awed, so much so I can't even say anything. I deserved that citation, and yet I'm not receiving one, and I think to myself that its a fucking miracle. I stutter out ""thank you so much."" and get up. The RA hands me back my ID and I go up to my friends room. Now, unfortunately for me the story isn't over. My friend is a great guy, but he's fucking pissed, because he was about ten seconds from getting laid for his first time before he had two RA's knocking on his door that his friend was throwing up in the lobby. So he's pissed, and he ends up putting me in his room and leaving to try and find this girl. I throw up some more and then end up passing out.
         
 As of right now I have only talked to this girl for about 5 minutes since that night and she hasn't responded to 2 of 3 texts I sent her, and the one she did respond to was only 5 messages, which is incredibly unlike the conversations that had previously taken place. Also my friend and I are on better terms, but he's definitely still mad. Oh and I may be banned from that dorm permanently because there was an incident report filed, which may or may not hurt my chances of being able to transfer there like I had planned.

TL;DR: I'm pretty sure there won't be a second date.",TIFU by vomiting in a lobby.,12
sherwood_bosco,7,11,1n5pg0,0,"So my school is fairly lenient on books and banned books, however today I managed to find one out of the VERY short list entirely by accident(By being caught reading it). Now I go to a public highschool in CO and this specific book was one that would cause quite a shock,

****It's worth saying at this point that I entertained ABSOLUTELY NO THOUGHTS/DREAMS/ETC. of using anything I found in this book, my curiosity was purely academic.****
Specifically I got this book in e-book form and was reading it on my phone in the class I TA for just at the end of class. So when the teacher asked me what I was reading I made up a BS answer by saying it was an interesting supplemental to my H chemistry class that I found online(Technically true). But when i set my phone on my lap to pack up my stuff she saw the cover page and pulled me into her office for a quick chat. Being the good student I am she agreed to keep this between me, the dean of students, and her.
So after missing my next class (AP statistics) for a chat with the dean, a woman who I'm well acquainted with for good reasons, she let me off due to my interest being purely academic. After all, I'm principle trumpet in Symphonic band, solo trumpet in the highest jazz band, taking 3 AP classes, and the rest are honors, that seemed highly believable to her.

Apparently there was a group of guys who came in and bought about a dozen amex gift cards for $400. And they came back tonight. According to our store policy (and possibly state law?), customers can only buy up to $500 in gift cards in a 24 hour period. In an effort to warn the other stores in the area, I started writing a district-wide email describing the customers and to be on the lookout. Well, during this time, one of the other managers called and told me about his suspicions that the credit cards they were using to purchase the gift cards were stolen. He told me I should probably call the police if they came in again. I thought ""Gee, I should probably include that in the email, then maybe we can catch these guys"". Yeah, big mistake.

bmward105,19,10,1n5ja0,19,"Well, I have a new girlfriend. Her name is Caitlyn. 
I live at home with my mom, grandma and great grandma (so much estrogen). Anyway, my great grandma broke her femur a while back and can't walk. We don't leve her alone for extended periods of time. 

Start the story!

Alright, so Caitlyn and I grab some coffee after class when my grandma calls me. She tells me she had to leave my great grandma. Now that means I need to get home, but not in any particular rush. So I offer to drive Caitlin home before I head to the homestead. She says it's fine and that we can chill at my house (awesome). So we get to the house and walk in to meet my great grandma. She's 93 and weighs about that much. She has a pretty bad memory and sometimes calls me Dennis (my dead uncle, not me). 

So we walk in and she says ""hello Ben, who is this?"" And I say ""mamaw this is Caitlyn."" Caitlyn says hi and then my great grandma turns to me and says ""wasnt her name Rachel the other day?""


Fuck. 

""What? No. You've never met Caitlyn.""

Cue Caitlyn, after pulling me aside: ""who the fuck is Rachel?""


Now I have no idea what to say, because I don't know of any Rachels that have been in my house. So I say the first thing that comes to my mind: 


Cue the fuck up

""My other girlfriend.""

Now it would be easy to read sarcasm into a comment like this, but my tone was not sarcastic and accidentally sounded quite serious. 

She didn't say much else the rest of the day. I tried to explain, but she didn't believe me. It also happens that I know a Rachel from another class and she hits on me a lot, so when I handed Caitlyn my phone to show my monogomy, Rachel decides it is the best time to text me and say ""what's up big dick? Wanna fuck tonight?""

Rachel is joking, but put into context, I can see how Caitlyn construed the whole situation. 

Unfortunately for me, Rachel was kidding, because now I'm single :(



**TL;DR gf meets great grandma. Great grandma calls her another name. Person with the same name texts me a R-rated message moment later.

MissD6,5,2,1n5j2p,2,"She's a musician and I'd like to get back into singing/choir, so I stayed after class to get some advice on the matter. A few minutes of chitchat later, her TA shows up, and I gather they have some kind of meeting scheduled so I try to leave, but she includes him (let's call him A) in the conversation. At some point in the conversation, the teacher mentions that I'm a bit quieter/more mature than the others. This conversation unfolds.

Me: ""I don't know, I'm 4 years older than the girls I hang out with, maybe that has something to do with it. I feel ooold ~"" (I was, of course, kidding, and it was very obvious).
A: ""Oh yeah, definitely. You're sooo mature, right?""

He has this kind of... I don't know, kidding/not kidding tone that I just can't figure out. So I just don't mind it and continue, trying to justify myself.

Me: ""Not at all. It's normal that we're not all on the same page, after all. Sometimes I just don't feel like I'm living the same reality, but the same goes for them, I guess. At times I just nod and smile, listening to them, because I have nothing pertinent to say.""
A: ""Oh, so you just shut up and judge them, is that it?""

At that point I have no idea how to react. Seeing how I'm confused, taken aback by his comment, he insists that it's a joke. But the thing is, I did not mean what I said as something mean, just that it's normal that I don't relate THAT much with a daddy's girl that has her studies paid and still lives with her parents and sisters, while I live in an appartment with my boyfriend and mostly pay my own stuff. Of course maybe I was a bit clumsy in the way I said it, I don't know, but I suddenly left the class, just saying a quick ""bye"". 

And now I feel like a condescending prick. I haven't stopped thinking about it since noon.

OscarTheImposter,8,7,1n5f0u,22,"The actual fuckup happened 12 days ago, but I just got out of the hospital yesterday and just discovered this awesome subreddit today - so now seems like a reasonable time to post.

As I said above, the situation I'm in today actually began - very suddenly - in the early-morning hours of the Friday the 13th (just under two weeks ago). I had enjoyed a typical night out at our college bars with some friends on Thursday night/Friday morning, and was pretty hammered by the time we retired to a friend's nearby home. Being the drunk idiots that we are, we decided to burn a large carpet from the hallway of the house. (To be fair, the thing had overstayed its welcome, and no one was going to miss it). 

We dragged the carpet out to his backyard, which is a pretty big gravel lot, and got it burning with the help of some kerosene. Fast-forward a few minutes, after we had thrown all our lighters  and nearby scrapwood in the fire. The only remaining accelerant available was the nearly-full can of kerosene we used to start the fire, and someone apparently chucked it into the fire (although it actually landed on the far edge of the fire, as I was soon to find out).

It was at this point that I - unaware of the kerosene can lying inconspicuously on the far side of the fire - decided to show my athletic prowess by jumping over the fire. While I did make it over the fire, I didn't clear the kerosene. In fact, I landed right on the can, emptying around a pint of it (I'm guessing here) into the direct area where my feet landed, perhaps a foot from the edge of the major flames).

My legs lit up like a christmas tree, and I was on fire in various spots from the waist down for what my friends guessed to be about 8 seconds. (My initial stop,drop, and roll was only partially successful since it was on gravel, and my friends had to rush over and slap out the fires that persisted - mainly the ones on the top of my left leg).

I tried to ride out the injury by sitting on bags of ice for most of the night, but in the morning I had to pay the piper and go to the hospital. The burns turned out to be second- and third-degree, and two areas required major skin grafts. I now look like a mummy, and pretty much spend all my time zonked out on painkillers in my bed or on Reddit - or sometimes both.

Since I know this is a pretty unbelievable story, here's an album of photos of the burn pre- and post-surgery for yall to enjoy [NSFW - kinda gross]: http://imgur.com/a/72YSy.

As you can see, I got grafts all around my left calf/ankle/top of foot. I also got a graft on my right inner calf/thigh, which I don't have a picture of. Luckily, the burns on the backs of my thighs healed well, and did not require any grafting.

Coco_Bowling,6,14,1n59u8,66,"This actually happened last night so I guess it's more like LNIFU.  Anyway, I was watching TV, being generally lazy after putting the kids to bed and decided that during the next commercial break I'd go get my nightly snack.  So the commercial comes on and I decide to try and pull a Risky Business slide across the kitchen floor because hey, that's always fun, right?  So I go into my slide like a pro, arm outstretched to grasp the cabinet knob as it comes into range and successfully open the cabinet door in one fluid movement.  I remember opening the cabinet with my left hand, reaching in with my right hand to grab the delicious fiber brownie goodness, and then I remember a feeling of euphoria and being very comfortable, like I'm laying on clouds.  So I open my eyes and I'm staring at the ceiling, having somehow ended up on the kitchen floor.  I realize at that point my nose and big toe are throbbing painfully and I kind of start to panic.  

What I imagine happened was, upon completion of my Risky slide, I stubbed my toe on the underside of the dishwasher, bent forward in exclamation directly into the cabinet door I'm opening with gusto and knocked the bridge of my nose in a violent manner and collapse upon impact.  That's the only logical conclusion I could come up with, so I stagger up, gather my snack, and shamefully wander back to the couch after realizing I was KOd by the kitchen cabinet.

Schmuck22,0,6,1n50p6,0,"One of my best friends from high school is the son of the CEO at a very prominent and well-known company. During the end of our senior year of high school, I was totally out-of-my-mind pulling a series of maneuvers that I am in no way proud to confess. To be honest, I am particularly lucky to have walked away without any injuries after completing any one of these stunts. After school one day, I decided to go on a “Jackass rampage” and make a complete fool of myself, which I have done repeatedly throughout my life. That afternoon I decided to climb onto the roof of my friend’s garage. I was readying myself to pull a MACGYVER-TYPE stunt: leap from atop the garage into my old, 1984 beater BMW through the open sunroof. I took a deep breath and CATAPULTED MYSLEF OFF THE GARAGE CRASHING HARD ON TOP OF THE VEHICLE. I rolled off my car to the pavement and hit my head hard on the concrete. I thought to myself after hitting my head, “Way to go you fuck-nut. You might as well go take a nap you pitiful bastard. You didn’t landing that stunt, you abysmal excuse for a man; MacGyver could do it, so could you. High FUCKING five, you jackass.” Funny enough, I decided to try this one more time, but the same thing occurred. I then decided to try something different, for my last attempt. Thinking to myself it’d be a great idea to COVER MY ENTIRE CAR WITH SOAPY WATER, so I could leap onto the hood off my vehicle and slide right over it like Mel Gibson in the film Ransom. I was already feeling a bit dizzy from hitting my head twice, which brought me to this next brilliant conclusion: I was going to need to protect myself before this next stunt. I began fitting my body with the following equipment: a set of kneepads, wrist guards and elbow pads, a helmet, and a chest protector to be totally safe and “protected.”




To make matters more ridiculous, a group of my friends were on the sidelines egging me on while simultaneously laughing at my expense—this feeling was something entirely familiar to me. My friend’s mom suddenly appeared, and I knew it was go time. I jetted towards my car from roughly 50-feet-away and jumped at a high speed towards the hood of the vehicle. I FLEW RIGHT INTO THE CAR CRASHING ELBOW FIRST THROUGH MY PORTION OF GLASS ON THE DRIVERS’ SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD.A spider web-like break covered the entire windshield appearing as if a nest of spiders miraculously came along and settled on it. Thankfully, I wore elbow pads and walked away unscathed. My friends were on the floor in balls out hysterics like a community of conversing chimpanzees. My friend’s mom flipped a shit and instantaneously kicked me off her property. I was now faced with a serious dilemma; how was I going not only to drive the car home safely, but what would my parents say being how insanely overprotective my mother was, and how big of a dick my father happened to be. What was I going to say to my parents; hi mom and dad, I don’t know what happened to the car—it wasn’t me—honest. I knew I had to come up with a good excuse, or it would be curtains for me indeed. As I pulled up to the front of my house, my mom spots the car from a mile away and immediately flips out. As she administers a massive dose of Estrogen-filled Jewish guilt, I immediately said the first thing that came to mind as I attempted to silence her for the remainder of the day regarding the vehicle. I said, “Mom I didn’t do this… I parked the car at the local mall, and when I returned, a huge rock was lying on the hood and the window was smashed to smithereens. Some asshole punished the car for no reason. I found it like this, and I didn’t do it—honest to God!” Somehow my mother believed this ridiculous tale of mine. She made my father, and I drive down to the mall to investigate the scene of the “so-called” crime where the vehicle was parked. Clearly, there was no rock nearby the parking spot, so we investigated further. My dad didn’t find anything at the mall to back up my story, unfortunately. I did, on the other hand, get away with murder. This should have been a wake-up call to me, but instead things just got worse and more out-of-control in my life from that point forward. I learned a valuable life lesson that day though: the things I see on television are false, and in the real world shit can happen if you are not careful.

ParanoidPolly,9,11,1n4xir,32,"I'll make this short because no one likes to read rambling. 

Here's what basically JUST happened. . .

I had just left the wifi cafe I go to whenever I want to download a ton of movies &amp; music without going over my own data plan with my ISP. On the way back to my apartment, I kept scratching my butt and legs, but I didn't think anything of it as my skin tends to get irritated when I ride my moped in humid weather and I figured my butt was probably just sweating.

Well, once I reach my place, I lift up my moped's trunk and, to my horror, seemingly THOUSANDS of tiny spider/ant looking fuckers were crawling in the inside of my scooter. Then, I noticed my seat was also crawling with those bugs. Hesitantly, I look down --not really wanting to find out the truth. To my dismay, my fears were confirmed. It was then that I realized the itchiness had not been caused by the humid weather; there were bugs all over my legs. 

Like a maniac, I scream out ""OH. MY. GAWWWWD"" and begin ripping my clothes off right then and there in the parking lot not giving a damn that my neighbors were right there, staring at me with ""WTF"" faces. I slammed the trunk closed and took off as if I were being chased all the way inside my apartment while yelping ""Omg bugs!"" and stripping down. 

Once inside, I took a shower and started cleaning and doing laundry. I can't stop itching like crazy and I still feel like the bugs are on me. In hindsight, I realize I kind've overreacted and my neighbors must think I'm on drugs. Granted, my past eccentric behavior probably already had them suspicious, but I'm sure they are now thinking ""I KNEW THAT BITCH WAS CRAZY"". 

I don't know about you readers, but I would rather be shitted on than have bugs crawl on me. I am actually typing this butt naked because I cannot stand wearing clothes right now. I am probably going to take another shower.

First off, let me say to never try this unless you do your research thoroughly. I thought I had, but obviously not:

So this happened over the weekend, and my partner told me to share it. 

I had to go to a political science convention in a major city in Texas, and I had been struggling with my weight because of some new medication I had been prescribed for my depression. Unsatisfied with my size, and not being able to fit into my suit jacket properly, I turned to the internet for tips to lose a few inches for a day. I came upon an article that explained how models use duct tape to lose a few inches around their waist for photo shoots. I told myself that I could handle that for a day, a day in the heat of Texas, and feel confident about my appearance in front of Texas representatives and a Senator. Here's how my day went:

4am- Took a shower and wrapped my waist in duct tape. I was feeling generous so I used a whole roll of duct tape.  

5am: Forced to use absolute proper posture, I gallantly floated to my car and held my breath to sit and drive to campus.
 
6am: Carpooled with my Political Science advisor and another student. Sat in the back with perfect posture and short breaths for a 4 hour drive.

930am: Convention starts and I am feeling great, and I am complimented on my appearance by some the students.

10am: First speaking panel begins. At this point, I can feel my chest tighten, and the room gets hotter, but no biggie.

1100pm: First panel ends, and I have to go to the bathroom. It was quite the challenge. I had the most perfect posture for any shitting session in existence.

1130pm: Lunch begins and I am sitting with other students from other universities across the state. I start seeing stars, but control my breathing. Everything is still okay.

1230pm: Second panel starts with the Senator speaking. At this point, there is a layer of sweat wanting to escape from underneath my duct tape girdle, but cannot due to the concrete stay of the tape. I adjust my sitting position and feel a sharp pain in my side; my skin tore. I started panicking, but kept my breathing in check and bit my cheek to help keep the pain at bay.

130pm: Senator's panel ends, and I go for a meet and greet. At this point I am sure I look like I had a stick up my ass, but I push through wanting to meet the Senator. After the meet and greet, I decide to go to the bathroom again. As soon as I sit down on the toilet, I can hear my skin, combined with the noise of the duct tape, tear. It hurt like a little bitch.

230pm: Third panel starts. I am sitting next to the guy that came with me, and I start to see stars again. No ounce of effort puts my dizziness and light-headedness at bay, so I struggle to a standing position, tell my partner I'm not feeling well, and head back to the bathroom. 

245-315pm: I completely undress myself in the stall, choosing to rip off the duct tape as a last resort. I didn't want to have to bear the excruciating pain of duct tape being removed from my waist, especially my happy trail hair. I use this time to air out my whole body, and try and relax. But to my dismay, the pain of blistering and the uncomfortableness of not being able to breath properly, I decided it was time to remove it. 

315-430pm: I slowly wedge my fingers through the girdle, biting my tie to take the pain. It smelled horrible and was drenched in sweat. I find the end of the duct tape and start pulling off. It was easy unwrapping the layered bits, but when I got to the tape on skin part, I was so much in pain, I almost passed out. It took me a good 45 mins to remove most of it, but it got so unbearable, I sat on the toilet seat for a breather. At this point most of my skin was exposed, so breathing was back to normal. My mistake in taking a break was exemplified when I didn't realize I had some duct tape hanging low enough to be in view. Some guy walked in, saw it, and freaked out. Hoping I wouldn't get shot for appearing to use duct tape to strap myself with weaponry, I hastily removed the final bits of tape. This was my second mistake in the stall. I thought using my own spit would help ease it off, and I took a leap of faith by ripping it all off in one pull. *KSHRETK.* I successfully removed all the duct tape, but unfortunately ripped off a good 6 inches of skin. I swayed until I leaned up against the wall, trying my hardest to stay conscious. I don't think I had ever experienced such pain in my life before. I was bawling my eyes out, and biting my tie as hard as I could. After like 15 minutes, I took a deep breath and put my clothes back on, which was painful as fuck since my shirt rubbed against my exposed sub-dermal skin as well as numerous blisters through out my stomach. Luckily, it turned out that the guy that walked in was the guy who came with us, thank god, and returned with my teacher. I embarrassingly explained to them what happened and they couldn't contain their laughter. 

430-8pm: The ride home was complete silence, with the occasional glance in the rear view mirror, followed by a cackle. 

**tl;dr** Duct tape really can be used for anything, even weight loss. 

**EDIT** [Here are two photos so you can see the damage. It doesn't look so bad, but trust me, it hurts like a bitch.](http://imgur.com/YGUabqK,r5uU66X) 

**EDIT2** Yo guys, I am not stupid. I understand the healthy way to do this is to workout and eat right. That is what I have been doing. The reason for my stupid decision is I had ordered a suit jacket from amazon. It arrived late, the evening before the convention, and was the wrong size. There was nothing I could do.

It was on pandora and I didnt even really take notice when it stopped from too much listening. So I forget my phone is still connected and go on with my business. My roommates gf brought some friends over to smoke and what not and its about time to get ready and clean up for class. Which means jack off in the shower time. So I turn the water on so it doesnt sound suspicious and proceed to fap to some hardcore stuff. (It was pretty wild must I add) At this point I have no idea my roommates and four really attractive girls are listening to what Im spanking too. I get out of the shower, dry off, and walk out to everyone giving me a really weird look. As I try to figure out what was up, I notice the sync light on my speaker is on. Im fucked.

Oh well, the show must go on, so I do my hair and hope for the best.  My hair is an excess of frizz, fluff and curls.  A flat iron and products are my best friends.  

Finish up the coffee and am ready to head out the door (still pouring buckets) when I realize my umbrella is in the car.  Not a problem, I can fix this.  Go back to the bathroom and get one of those little bathroom sized trash bags, and proceed to put it on top of my head.  Hmm… there’s some hair still sticking out, so I pull it down further and poke out eye holes.  Success!  HA!  Fuck you mother nature – I win!

Go down to the car and the family across the street is getting their kids in the car.  I wave, knowing I look like an idiot.  They just stare at me – they don’t even wave back.  They just keep staring at me – even as I get in the car.  I don’t think much of it.  At that point I’m not thinking much of anything because my coffee hasn’t kicked in and I’m wondering if I can remember how to operate my car.

Anyway, I start driving to work and about halfway there I realize that I have indeed fucked up.  Mostly because the trash bag on my head was white, had a point at the top and eyeholes poked out, and that the family across the street is black.

crustonblack,4,7,1n38dg,19,"A while back my friend's gf started talking about setting me up with one of her friends. I honestly don't enjoy those types of situations, but I appreciated the sentiment. While I was really drunk, she asked something along the lines of going out for drinks with some people. There was probably some subtext or words or something that drunken me completely missed, but never being the one to turn down an opportunity to get drunk, I agreed.  

Day and night before I go to my friend’s house and take a bunch of acid then crash there.  The next day I drive over to pick them all up, notice from a distance there is an extra head. I get closer and also notice they are all pretty well dressed up, friend is wearing a collared shirt and the two girls are in dresses. I’m still wearing the same thing that I took acid in, a denim jacket with a bunch of hardcore/grind/crust patches on it hoody underneath, torn jeans and a pair of shitty vans. I’m listening to thrash pretty loud and smoking a cigarette. 

 I had to move empty beer bottles off the back seat to make room for everyone. I figure no one else likes thrash, so I let my friend choose music from my ipod and he accidently puts on some grindcore. My friends gf  gives me a noticeable dissenting look.  While I like her a lot and consider her a pretty good friend, both my friend and  gf is not at all into the punk thing. Both her and her friend go to a fashion college, very status, image and health conscious. 

I find out later we ended up going to a different bar, because of how I was dressed. My friend directly tells me that I was being set up with her. I had been pretty oblivious till then. I then proceeded to get a little too drunk and began singing power metal songs. I, at least, ended up having a pretty good time, but I don’t think the girl ever got over her first impression of me. This was probably fair enough, because it was a fairly accurate representation of me.  She had obviously put time into her makeup, and I hadn’t even showered.  Pretty different.  Even at the time I thought the situation was pretty amusing. Friends gf was pretty annoyed with me though.

vikingnurse,88,327,1n30s1,1095,"So, I have had this amazing African Grey for the last 8 years. He has a vocabulary of over 150 words, and is capable of forming random sentences and shit.

Anyway, here are a few fuckups following his ability to speak, and both my hobby of teaching him as well as my friend´s hobby of teaching him the most foul things.

1. We´re at a café. Sesar (that´s his name) hates women and has always done. Cute little waitress walks to our table, brings me a coffee and Sesar a bowl of fruits (didn´t ask her for it even).
Girl: Awwww what a cute little guy^^ Does he speak?
Sesar: - Shut up!
Girl: wow, that´s some beak he got there?
Sesar: fuck off! Get out you twat! Slut... (NB: not me who tought him the misogynistic thingies)
Girl: ehh...right?
Sesar: Yeah, shove it! Now fuck off...dog..*barks at her*

A few minutes later with the poor waitress bursting out in tears out of laughter, we were approached by the manager who said she had had some complaints from elderly people and people with young kids. We had to sit outside. Sesar´s reaction? Hysterical laughter all the way out. Me? Shamed and shamed and shamed for appearing to be a terrible owner, as he speaks in my exact voice...

2. Sometimes when I teach him new stuff, he confuses the words. A few years ago, I wanted to teach him how to say ""help, i´ve been turned into a parrot!""... Oh well, that didn´t go better than the fact that he only learned how to shout ""heeeeeelp!""
A few days later: Sesar is practicing his new vocabulary in an extraordinarily manner. I mean really loud. I hear a knock on my door and something like ""this is the police! Are you allright in there?"" is called from the other side of the door. 

I open the door with a large ""WTF"" on my face and they told me a concerned neighbour heard someone shouting for help from my apartment. Then a loud ""HEEEEEEELP!!"" is heard from the living room. Cops rush there, see featherball on his stick laughing hysterically. Cops went silent for a second, then joined sesar in hysterical laughter. Parrot and cops became best friends and we ended up having a coffee and chatting about how this was one of their funniest incidents to date.

3. Driving with Sesar in the passenger seat on our way to get some burgers and go to my parent´s for a visit. Had had a party the weekend before where apparently he was tought some very bad habits by my friends.

I order my food in the drive-thru, forget about the ball of feathers in the front seat and listen to music while I wait. All of a sudden I see that 4-5 staff members are gathered at the window, looking at Sesar. Sesar, silent until then, decides to put on public display his newly learnt vocabulary.... Examples:

- *moans in a male voice, then moans as a female, then in the end moans a manly ""ahhhhhhhhhh"" *

- (in a female voice)*stop it! You´re being aggressive! (you´re being aggressive = sesar´s version of saying you´re nice... Icelandic: þú ert ágætur(nice), sesar´s version: þú ert ágengur(aggressive) 
...*silence*...(male voice): come on! Lemmeshag!...*moans manly*

- Get... the... F****...OUT!....C***...dog...

- PENISPENISPENISPENISPENIS!!!....*hysterical laughter ensues*

Needless to say, I got shamed by my own parrot.
This is not counting the times he has said other girl´s names if i´m having a girl over, cursing my grandparents, scolding my little nephew and teaching him bad words, biting my brother´s dog´s tail and nose etc etc etc


tl;dr: Parrots are dicks.

EDIT 2:

If you find this funny and want one, please don´t just because they speak. He´s extremely hilarious and has been the brightest point in my life for the last 8 years, but CAGs (as well as other parrots) are extremely demanding pets who deserve a LOT of time caring for them, attention, training and such. I´ve never had a problem with him thankfully, but after i started working shifts full-time (I´m an emergency RN) he developed some problems. Also, I had to move across the globe to do my Master´s and it´s affecting him seriously. So please read a LOT about those guys before you think about getting one. This is a huge commitment and a long term one, as these guys live normally for 40-60 years. More than happy to answer any questions in PM.


EDIT 3 (for the lulz)

More examples of his behavioral shenanigans (conditioned, i presume):

- always when someone opens up or drinks something for a can, Sesar burps violently.

- if someone farts around him, Sesar has been conditioned to say either ""good boy"" or laugh hysterically

- he also does the cutest things (non-vulgar ones): Examples would be saying ""wannacuddle?"" and rub his beak on your fingers, ""gimmeakiss"" and rub his beak up to someone´s mouth (normally mine... during puberty he was a dick and did this and bit my lower lip in half)....

- he gets extremely horny after I take a shower. If I don´t take him into the shower with me, I´m rewarded with him trying to shag my hand when I get out of the shower",TIFU a lot of times by teaching my parrot how to speak,1422
jennyfc92,3,14,1n2s3w,44,"My roommate, who over the summer broke up with her boyfriend of almost 3 years, came back in tears talking about suicide. I got texts from my friends saying that they were worried about her and said she had told them things like *""everyone would be better off without me""* and *""I'm going to jump off a building""*. So me, not being one to handle these situations well, decided to call the professionals. I contacted the resident assistant for our apartment complex (owned by the college) and he brought an officer with him. They talked to her and were able to calm her down a bit.

About an hour or so later I go in there to see how she's doing and they're just casually chatting, trying to take her mind off things while one of the school's psychologists comes to talk to her and set up an appointment. She's talking about all the assignments that she has to do in the upcoming week and how she's taking 19 credits this semester.

defenestratedllama,5,4,1n2jbu,17,"I'll start by saying that I'm in high school, and am just old enough to legally ride the quads that I've been riding for a few years already. So today I was out riding my quad by myself through a field by my house. It was ideal weather, nice and warm and sunny, and I was having a blast. I was riding through some pretty tall grass, making sure to check for rocks. At one point I was standing up on the quad, and I saw what I thought looked like a boulder just up ahead, so I lean forward a bit and slowed down to get a closer look, to make sure I don't hit it. 

**BAM.**

I open my eyes, I'm laying on the ground and in pain all throughout my upper body. There's cuts all over my hands and a huge scrape across my stomach. The quad has shut off by itself, and is on it's side. I get up onto my knees and stretch out my arms to make sure I didn't break anything. I waited for a few minutes just for my adrenaline level to go down so I could examine the situation, and then I stand up. I take off my gear, and find a crack in the visor of my helmet. I look around to see what happened, and I'm still not entirely sure, but my best guess is that while I was looking ahead at what I thought was a boulder, I hit a big rock that I didn't see and it tipped the quad, but I was going just fast enough that I didn't fall off, I was rather launched off the quad. 

So now I'm in a bit of a pickle, I can't flip the quad back over by myself (It's on of [these](http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00RvAQeZoKkbqV/EEC-500CC-Utility-ATV-500CC-ATV-Quad-Fpa500e-3-.jpg) bad boys, so it's too heavy) I'm a few miles away from home, I live on an acreage so there isn't much for civilization anywhere close except for some cows, and get this, my phone was dead. That's right, I was stupid enough to go out riding by myself with an almost dead phone. So I do the only logical thing, start walking. I trek my way through the thistles and weeds to the road, and start trudging my way back. Bear in mind that I've just been launched off my ATV so my shirt is ripped up the side, theres a huge scrape that the rip is revealing, and theres several minor cuts on my hands so they're all bloody. 

I've been walking for a while, when I see a truck (the only vehicle I saw on the entire trek) coming my way.

*oh yes thank you Jesus I can wave him down and maybe he'll let me use his phone*

Nope. He turns onto another road before he even sees me. So I finally get back home after a long, long, hot, and thirsty walk. And as I walk in I'm greeted by my mom. She looks at me with a sort of shocked expression, and I say the only thing that comes to my mind.

*yeah, there's a bit of a problem with the quad, and I walked back*

I tell her the story and she starts the typical mom stuff

*oh sweetie you could've gotten so hurt! are you sure you didn't break anything? I knew I shouldn't have let you go! Does your head hurt? are those cuts infected? how long were you walking? are you sure you didn't hit your head? you must be thirsty!*

At least she cares about me. So I phone my dad and I tell him what happened, he thinks it's pretty cool (or so he says). So when my dad gets home we go back in my truck to where the quad is tipped, and we push it over right side up. We examined the body, and here's the verdict:

The frame is completely bent, it's unrepairable. The quad is under insurance and my dad isn't mad at all since he was looking into getting rid of it anyway, but still I feel like a major moron. I've been riding ATV's since I was four, and I was paying little enough attention to not notice the massive freaking boulder that I hit. Not only that, but I hit it hard enough to bend the flippin frame. I know I should be glad that I walked away, because I know it could have been way worse, but still.

I went back and looked at the picture to see if I could tell there were turtles swimming around, and that's when I noticed that my naked reflection in the aquarium glass was clearly visible.

thereverendjoseph,3,8,1n0oia,32,"So this actually happened a few years ago while I was in high school, and it's gotten to be a pretty popular story passed on with my debate team.

At the time, I went to a catholic, all-boy school where many of the teachers were priests or monks. I was also the captain of the Lincoln Douglas (one-on-one) debate team and so I worked very closely with our coach, who was a monk. Despite whatever you may think about monks, he was a pretty cool guy and was pretty easy to get along with so long as you didn't piss him off.

Also at this time, I had been experiencing some computer trouble. For instance, google chrome, my default browser, was having trouble working when I wanted it to. It would also load many pages very slowly. It was pretty irritating.

A few months into my senior year, we had a debate tournament in a nearby city. It was a large tournament, and like many large tournaments it had posted its brackets, wins/losses, and reviews of debate rounds to a website designed specifically for debate tournaments. I had brought my computer with me to the tournament because I would usually read my speeches off of my computer, and I was tethering through my phone for internet because the school the tournament was in had a wifi password. So basically, I was the one of the few people on our team who had internet access.

Naturally, while we wait between rounds in the school auditorium the coach wants to use my computer for a few minutes to check on the website postings. I see no problem with this, so I gave him my laptop. I already had chrome up and everything, so all he had to do was open a new tab and enter in the website url.

He sits at the computer for a few minutes while I play doodle jump a few rows away, and then says he's done and I can take the computer back. Cool, I think, and go and get it from him. He closes it, and as I take it he says ""Thank you thereverendjoseph, THANK you"" almost in a malicious way. Uhm, okay, cool. You're welcome? Whatever. I sat back down in my seat and continued at doodle jump.

A few minutes later I decided to make some edits to my speeches based on some things I had overheard in other team discussions. I open up my laptop. There is a pdf open of the current debate brackets, but it isn't quite at the top of the screen. At the top of the screen, to my dismay, was a series of firefox tabs: ""slut takes it in from behind"", ""horny milf bangs teen"", etc., followed by ""debatepostings.com"" or whatever it was called. 

I had forgotten that, about a month or two prior, I had gotten pissed off at chrome while trying to find some decent porn that I had opted to use firefox instead. Now, I'm not dumb, I use incognito windows, but since I used firefox I had just used a normal window for it, and had forgotten that I had firefox set to open up to the last closed window because I so rarely used the browser. When he went on my computer, he had opened firefox rather than just using chrome, and bam, porn.

While I was figuring all of this out, which took only about thirty seconds, I was too engaged in trying to figure out what the hell had happened to realize that the sound was on, and the videos were all *playing*, and my sound was on. I was in an auditorium full of 200+ kids, and I had moans coming from my computer. I slammed my computer shut as soon as I realized, and people in the rows around me were staring, understandably.

The monk and I stayed friends, and we talked every now and then, but he never quite trusted me with a computer in his presence. I assume he thought I was watching porn at the debate tournament, and he had just caught a glimpse of that. But yeah, I fucked up pretty hard.

johnknoefler,20,27,1n0jzj,125,"My subcontractor asked me to join a crew in Charleston South Carolina at a shipyard. I was a bit vague on the name of the shipyard and I suppose they thought I would meet up at the motel and then go with the whole group to the yard. I got there a day early and asked directions at a local gas station and ended up at a small privately owned shipyard on a water way. When I introduced myself to the supervisor of the hull division and said who I was with he had what I thought of as the time a smirky grin. I was puzzled why he smiled like that. He was happy I was here I guess? And he called a foreman from the yard in and had me go with him for my weld test. The foreman took me out and showed me where he wanted me to weld on the ship. Now that's odd I thought. They don't even know if I can weld and they just throw me at some work. Ok. No matter. That's just how they roll here. 

I went to work every day for two months. The rest of the crew seemed to be working somewhere else at a large navy yard where they didn't seem to work very hard. I came back to the motel tired and beat from working my ass off while they came back all chipper and full of jokes and suspiciously clean. 

Then one day the subcontract CEO was being friendly with me and he suddenly asked me why he never saw me at work. ""I don't know. I go to work every day and I never see you there either."" So he is looking puzzled but I don't mind. I know I earned my checks. My time gets sent in by the yard and my check comes back from the subcontract office. What's to worry. Then he asks me where I actually am working. Detyen Shipyard I reply. Suddenly he busts out laughing at me. ""Not to worry. We have a contract with them too and it's all good. You just weren't supposed to be there. ""

Finally it dawns on me why the supervisor there at the yard had that smirk and why he was so hot to put me to work that very day. He wanted me to be working at HIS yard so he could claim he already had me and it was a done deal. And to make it more secure he never spoke to the CEO about it.

sublym0nal,6,6,1n076r,9,"So the other day, my friend had updated his iPhone 4 to iOS 7. Part of his password had letters in a keyboard different than that of the default, and for some reason the update did not carry those settings over, which effectively locked him out of his phone. Earlier today, I helped him and ended up restoring his phone to factory settings. I set it up as a new phone, then configured his keyboard before restoring from the latest backup he had. It had finished restoring much earlier than expected, and he had left a minute ago for class, so I go run after him to give him his phone back. I try to give him his phone in a nearby parking lot, and it slips out of my hand, falling face-first into the curb and spider-webbing the front screen.

WhiteNoiseSupremacy,13,10,1mzzu5,46,"So, this didn't happen yesterday but in July. Me and my lady have been together for 7 years today (but got married in July 20th), so I thought it'd be good time to share this story.

The night before the wedding me and my bestman went to our local small pub to have a couple of pints. (The pub and the wedding place are in the region we used to live in when we were younger.) We talked about the next day and how my life had come to this and so on, I even talked how I wasn't scared or anxious. We even saw some of my friends from another town (where me and Mrs. live nowadays), so we had two more beers each. So when we got to bed it was like 3 am and we had to get up at 8. So not too much sleep for the night, and the next day would be a big one.

Well, despite my lack of sleep the next day was perfect. Fucking flawless. I was so goddamn scared at the altar before my soon-to-be-wife entered the main hall, but still it was marvelous. A friend performed a song by Enya with her violin at the church and our wedding march (or is it hymeneal in the US?) was Outro by M83, so I couldn't hold back the tears.

The party itself was also so great, even though I feared beforehand that I'd get too drunk at my own wedding. We partied till 4 am, and then everyone ordered cabs, including me, the wife and our siblings and cousins. Since the place was at the countryside, we waited for our taxi for an hour. And during that time I drank the last bottle of champagne by myself and had fun with the remaining guests.

The taxi arrives, I hop in, and pass out immediately. I remember everything except the cab ride. When the taxi arrived to our hotel, nobody could wake me up, so my now-wife just stood there and laughed her pretty little ass of while our friends, four of them, carried me to our suite, the bride giggling behind us. Or so I heard. They even tried to take off my suit, but eventually gave up and went to their own rooms.

Midday. I wake up. I feel quite... moist, so to speak. I immediately knew what happened. Thought: ""No fucking way, not here, not now. Not again."" My bonjour-suit and the 3000 dollar bed were soaked. Pee all over. This wasn't the first or the second time it had happened, but you know, this time it really ruined my morning. And morning wood. So there we were, lying in my piss, drinking champagne and eating grapes and enjoying the first day of our marriage.

Xandrosaurus,54,64,1mxtv0,113,"I live in a slightly ghetto neighborhood, and I have a medium sized dog. There are a lot of untrue stereotypes about ghetto folk, but from experience, the one where they're terrified of dogs is pretty accurate. I try to be accommodating and keep my dog away from anyone who looks uncomfortable. I've gotten good at reading body language; if someone stops walking and stares, or suddenly changes their walking pattern when they see her, or screams and hides behind their friend, I'll take that as a sign that they're not a big fan of dogs. I'll just walk her by the curb, or keep her close to me until they pass. It's not always possible to keep her in a bubble, so I sometimes have to ignore the eye rolls, gasps, and the ""hey mister, control your dog"" when we walk calmly past them. 

Today, I went to the off leash section of Prospect Park. Legally, you're allowed to have your dog off leash before 9AM and after 9PM in certain areas, but people usually come at 6PM and there's never an issue. We left when it started getting dark. There weren't many people near the park exit (a ""no dogs off leash"" area), so I decided to drain her last bit of energy by throwing a tennis ball around. From a shadowy corner, I heard a woman with a thick Jamaican accent yelling:

""Hey! You need to put that dog on a leash, Mon!"" I might have added the ""Mon"" part.

That pissed me off. My dog is harmless and she was nowhere near this person, so why does she care if my dog is running around off leash? Get over your fear, lady! I ignored her and kept playing with my dog. 

She yelled the same thing again. This time I was about to ask what her fucking problem was. I got as far as ""What..."" and froze. She left her shadowy corner and was advancing towards us. She had her hand on her gun. She had the I'm-gonna-shoot-your-dog-if-it-comes-near-me look on her face. You know the one.

Oh, did I mention she was a cop? I quickly leashed the dog and muttered ""sorry"". She relaxed and went back to her position. I left the park shortly after, embarrassed but also grateful my dog wasn't shot and that I didn't get a ticket.

As for the ""your dog should be on leash"" comments, I wouldn't do this if she didn't have spot on recall. She ignores the world around her if there's a ball around. I only do it in the park, away from cars or other dangers, and she's leashed if there's a lot of people around. I'm not putting her or anyone at risk.

Among them was this cutie, who I ended up talking to for a couple hours. We got along great, had great eye contact, have the same interests and music tastes. She tells me she works at a bar a block away, and to check it out sometime. At one point she says she wants her bill.  I bought one of her pints of two hearted ale, and asked what she was up to. She replied telling me she was going to go home and drink some wine, and asked what I was doing, I said I was going home, as I was closing the bar, and then opening it in the early afternoon.  I was writing my number down to give to her, turned around and she was gone.

On Wednesday, I was opening the bar. I was on the patio, there was a lot of foot traffic as we are downtown. So I was bent over a table, wiping it down, and someone runs their finger up my back, lower back to neck.  I look up just in time to see her walk by and smile at me, killer eye contact! But , headphones on, she turns away and keeps walking.  But at this point, I'm sure she wants the D, I can just visit her at work sometime.

Last night, I got off work early, had my shift drink and the bartender made me a second one. I wanted to go to her bar and give her a visit so I downed the second drink and left for her bar. Turns out she is a waitress, and kinda busy, but after I have a beer and a shot of whiskey and order another beer, I am actually rather buzzed and was starting to slur a bit.  I was talking to some people around me at the bar, she didnt look like she was having a good night. I wrote my number down on a slip of paper, and then saw her coming over to say hi.

Here's how I remember it went:

I had already written my number down on a price of paper, and grabbed it and say ""hey, I really just came by to see you, but I can see you're busy."" I hand her my number, she looks slightly taken aback, and I say ""you should call me if you want to hang out sometime"". Now my memory is kinda fuzzy, from having about 5 or 6 drinks in me at this point. I turn to grab my beer or my phone or something, I don't remember her saying anything, and I turn back and she is walking away. I did see her pocket my number though, so I guess I just have to wait and see if she calls or stops into my bar sometime.  

But my feeling is that she isn't going to call.

Coastal_Cruise,12,24,1mvqua,96,"I'll explain this in chronological order.

During the end of the last school academic school year (spring semester), I decided that I wanted to take a break from my university in order to resolve some anxiety issues that I had been experiencing over the past year. I finished the spring semester and returned home to my family for the summer. During the summer I decided that I wanted to take a physics class at the local university in my hometown in order to fulfill a requirement for my major and have the credits transfer over to the university that I have been attending (might as well do something productive while I'm at home).

Fall semester rolls around the corner and I attempt to sign up for the physics class at the local university. I encountered a few initial difficulties as I attempted to sign-up for this class (I had to get the approval of the instructor because I wasn't considered a full-time student). I had to crash the first day of class in order to even hope to get onto the class roster. On that first day I realized that the class was incredibly overbooked, but as luck would have it, the university decided to add a 2nd lecture for the physics class because the 1st class was so overbooked (for clarification, both of the classes teach the same material, but they are technically different classes and taught by different professors). After getting the approval of the Professor teaching the 2nd lecture, I turn in all of my paperwork and pay for the class.

Fast-forward to this week. After weeks of emailing different people I am finally able to access the school's online resource website that each student logs into in order to check their school-related finances, class registration, and other miscellaneous stuff. While exploring the class registration portion of the site that shows all the classes for which you are registered, I came to the horrible realization that I am actually enrolled in the first lecture and that I have been attending the wrong class since the start of the semester. This means that I have missed credits for participation in class, at least a few homework assignments, and the first midterm for the class.

I just emailed the professor of the class for which I am registered basically admitting how much of a dumbass I am for going to the wrong class and begging for some sort of way to make up the credit that I have missed. I feel like I'm on the verge of an anxiety attack.",TIFU by realizing that I have been attending the wrong class,120

NeedSomeSplaining,17,12,1mve4t,39,"In reality the whole thing was pretty minor, but I felt like shit. So my dad and I were getting our 1931 Ford Model A out of a storage unit about 1.5 miles from our house. This car belonged to my great grandfather and is all my dad has left of his granddad. Needless to say, it has a lot of sentimental value.



 We planned to drive it home, but it wouldn't start. No big deal, well tow it. Keep in mind this car had no power brakes to begin with and stopping distance leaves something to be desired. Did I mention I've never had to tow before and this is only about the 4th time ive driven the car? But hey, its just steering and braking for a little bit, right?



So I'm being towed in the Ford while my dad pulls with his pickup. All fine till we turn the corner onto our street. My dad slowed down too much and slack got in the tow strap and it got caught in the wheel. I yelled at my dad to stop and he stopped a bit more suddenly than I expected. I didn't brake soon enough and my momentum carried me into the rear bumper of his truck.



LUCKILY, I turned the wheel enough to just scrape the corner. It was slow enough that the dent in the left front fender was only about 4 inches long. So not a huge deal. I felt like throwing up though. My dad wasnt even fazed. All he said was ""Oops, needs new paint anyway."" So it really could have been worse. But I felt like shit the rest of the night.

CaptainSnowy,47,196,1mv4w9,461,"Alright. So, at around 5:15 in the evening (about 25 minutes ago), I decided to make myself a cup of tea to fight off the mid-evening snooze and get focused for the night ahead. It started off just like any other mid-Saturday affair, except all day today I've had a piercing headache.

Actually, let me elaborate a bit. A few hours before, during, or after a big rainstorm, I typically get a decimating skull-fuck from Satan himself for an uncomfortably long period of time. The rain had just stopped a few minutes before I decided to take that fateful walk over to the kitchen. 

I was pretty much just wiping the seed of Lucifer off my chin. 

Naturally, I was in a haze. Everything looked really bright, and my eyes dully throbbed whenever I moved them. I wandered over to the stove, and put on the kettle. My hands shambled over to the cabinet where I keep my cups. 

There were none. The dishwasher was running.

fml.jpg

Now, here's where the fucking up starts. Instead of being a non-dumbass and just not making any tea, I decided it would be a better idea to search for an alternative drinking vessel to employ for the job.

I made my way to fridge; a journey that seemed to take hours. Opened the door. The only remotely cup-worthy receptacle to be found was an apple sauce jar of dubious age. It was about 3/4 empty, so I washed it out and plopped a tea bag into its murky depths. The water boiled. I poured it into the jar. Waited 2-3 minutes. Ready to drink.

Take a large sip. Swallow with gusto.

...

Holy mother of all that is shitty, it was bad. 

Imagine throwing up after drinking too much booze. Picture that watery, sticky ooze all over your carpet. Your hasn't-been-washed-since-1995 shag carpet. Now, imagine scraping all of that up and scooping it into a used, steaming toilet, chunks and all. Stir it up a little. 

That's what this nightmare fluid tasted like.

Part of me couldn't believe how utterly disgusting it was. I stood for a moment in silence, slowly understanding the error I had made. I ran to the bathroom and promptly vomited into the shitter. I stood up and looked myself in the eye in the mirror.

""You pathetic fool.""

As it turns out, the apple sauce I thought I had washed away was about a month past the expiration date. Also, my hardly lucid self failed to do a proper job of rinsing it out, and upon further inspection, there were still congealed chunks of congealed demon-bile floating around in the tea water. 

The stomach ache hasn't gone away. I feel like a possum being eaten alive by a rabid raccoon.

tonygordita,11,25,1mu65v,74,"Ok, so yesterday my dumb ass went into work with a righteous hangover. You know, one of those 'wake up still kinda drunk and totally nauseous, you could throw up at any minute' type deals.

Motherfuck, really? I have to work 8 hours like this?

So, backstory: I work in a chem lab. The thing with labs is that the tests are always running. They constantly need to be monitored and upkept with different intervals that are on a set schedule. Calling out? No bueno, dude. These fuckers hate that shit.

And I call out a little too much. As in, I had to meet with my supervisor and boss recently about my attendance. So calling out because of a hangover? Yeah, no. Suck it up, pussy.

So anyways, Thursday night rolls around and the roomie and I are getting hammered while playing GTA V. Awwwww yeahhhhh. Good shit. You see, the roomie is a bartender and he sometimes makes pitchers of pretty dope drinks. That shit Thursday night was *loaded* and tasted real good, so I'm getting balls deep in this demon water.

Midnight approaches and I somehow made it to my bed to pass out. And now it's 6:45AM and my alarm is blaring. Snooze-city, population this guy. I'm not outta bed til 7:20. Throw on some clothes real quick and I'm out the door. On the way to work, I pick up a breakfast sandwich and I make it on time. But Hell, I'm feeling real shitty. So I chug some coffee and get an iced tea at the vending machine as well as a few cups of water from the cooler because this is one dehydrated hombre.

Some would say this isn't my first rodeo, and I figure I'll make it to lunch and be good after that like the previous times.

So I'm working for about 3 hours with intermittent periods of extreme nausea, including running outside at one point certain I was gonna barf. But I didn't. And I really wish I had then, because I could have controlled the damage.

About this time, the coffee is hitting me real hard. You fucking know I'm about to get paid to shit my balls off. So I'm in the disproportionately small bathroom with regards to the amount of employed individuals in this building--aka it's always full--and I'm getting down on some quality poop-time.

And then I feel it. The definite sour-taste-in-your-mouth of a symphony of shame type throw up session. Here I am on the toilet in a full bathroom and I'm gonna throw up. Hard. So I quickly pull up my pants and flush, hoping to run out into the back of the parking lot in time to handle this like a gentleman. But that's a far distance.

In hindsight, I was naive to think I'd make it.

As I'm standing there, suddenly BLURPHF I barf in my mouth. Just a mouthful, but there I'm standing with a mouthful of barf and no idea where to put it because once I spit it out, the rest is coming up. And I'm, ya know, SURROUNDED  BY MY COLLEAGUES. After about 10 seconds of deliberation, it suddenly dawns on me that I have a mouthful of sour, disgusting, chunky barf and this shit is GROSS.

In my haste, I decided to spit it in the trash real quick, wash my hands, and make for outside. I probably got about 5 steps out the back door when it happened. And it happened hard.

Projectile vomit all over a high-traffic parking lot. Instinctively, I cover my mouth. Bad idea. It sprays ALL OVER MY FACE AND SHIRT. A veritable bacon egg and cheese, coffee, and iced tea deluge of dismay.

Now here's the thing: I never once stopped walking, and quickly at that. Mid-stride I start projectile vomiting and somehow am able to avoid it getting on my jeans, and that's a key point. I've got shirts in my car, but no pants. This huge wave of shame is billowing from my mouth and I dodge it like some punk ass playing vomit dodgeball for everyone to see.

So now I'm running to the back of the parking lot when I realize my car keys are in my desk. Barf in my hair, on my face, dripping from my nose, all over my shirt and arms, and I'm stuck outside. I frantically start calling everyone inside I know but no one answers.

You horse fuckers.

So now I'm trying to figure out what to do, and I decide to flip my shirt inside out after wiping my face, put it on barf-to-skin, and run into the backdoor to my desk, get my keys, and run back out.

Now, I'm not trying to be graphic or anything, but the squish of cold vomit to skin was awful. Truly reprehensible. Also: the smell.

So I do the deed with no problem, change my shit, and now it's time to clean up my stomach shame and call it a morning. As I'm wiping it up with some rags and tossing it in the dumpster, one of the higher-ups in another department sees me and asks what happened.

""I threw up.""

He looks at me, doesn't say a word, and keeps walking. So I go back to work and finish my day with a bruised ego and some laughing coworkers.

So after that ridiculous incident my boss was always on edge with me. If I wasn't absolutely perfect he would threaten to fire me. Even if I had a hundred things to do during my short shift and did 99 of them he would still fault me for not doing the one thing. For missing restocking one six pack or missing a spot of dust. Finally at the beginning of August late on Sunday night I got a text saying that I would come in on Monday, my day off, without pay to ""finish what I started"" or I would be fired. Immediately I called him and agreed to do it if only to keep my job another week or two until I was able to find something new. I spent the whole night talking (and crying and hyperventilating) over the phone to my friend who said that he couldn't ask that of me and it was illegal. She said I had to tell him no. So I texted him back at 11:00 pm to say that I was sorry, but I couldn't work for free. He texted me back at 1:00 am to say that I was fired.

Didn't really take note of the fact that I hadn't pooped on a couple of days, so when I go to the bathroom for my nightly ablutions and feel that familiar urge, I plop myself down, whip out the phone, and get myself settled in for a satisfying poop.

This was an extrteme bowel emergency so I entered the first one I located, which was the handicapped accessible bathroom. 

So, Im in there doing my business and I hear two women talking outside the door. One of the women is clearly upset stating, ""I just saw some young able bodied guy walk into the bathroom. THIS BATHROOM IS FOR THE ELDERLY OR DISABLED! Im waiting out here and he is in there when he could have walked up one flight of steps. I DEMAND he be held accountable"" Another woman replies, ""I apologize about that ma'am. I'll speak to him when he leaves."" 

At this point I get a bit nervous. What do I do? So, in all my infinite wisdom, I decide to pretend to be handicapped. I open the door with my left hand, while walking out of the bathroom with my right hand held up to my chest like [this](http://imgur.com/clfp14S). The first woman I see is an overwight woman with a walker. She looks at me and says, ""Oh, sorry hun. I was mistaken.""

However, all students have to complete a thesis project and write a paper on their project to be submitted to the school prior to graduation. I was planning on submitting mine on Monday.

About two hours ago, I was messing around with a code file that I found on gitHub for an open source game. I had created a code project on my computer's desktop to try and compile the game. When I was done with the code project, I deleted it, and reflexively hit the checkbox asking if I wanted to ""delete all files in the project folder"". Sure, why not, right? The contents of that folder (my desktop), included several movies I had digitized, and the only copy of my very nearly finished engineering thesis (my last backup is from 3 months ago).

One of our friends passes out, so being the lovley friends we are, we decide to set fire to his feet he awoke and I was at the bottom of the bed looking guilty as fuck wielding a can of hairspray used to fuel the sock fire on his feet. He glances down at me and assures me revenge will be swift. I brush this off and we all carry on drinking. I pass out, then I'm awoken with a naked ass above my head bearing down on my face; my friend who I had earlier assulted that evening was attempting to pink eye me in my sleep as a petty act of revenge, however in his effort to fart as I was waking up he actually shit on my forehead. 

I woke up, ran to the bathroom and washed my head. I was pretty fucked up so I didn't give a shit... 

I returned to my pile of cussions and blankets and returned to my slumber. 

I woke up the next morning and we all laughed at the events of the evening just gone. 

I decided to leave and said my goodbyes, as I was leaving the preasure in my bowl changed and a low moan eminated from my gut, I ignored it and carried on walking down the street into the town to get my bus home. 

I sat down at the bus station, my gut making unholy noises. All of a sudden it hit me, the urge to let one rip, no one was around so I did, I applied full force and effort into this fart as it began to leave my lower colon to join the world I noticed it was carrying some weight, I clenched my asshole but it was too late, before I knew it I was sat in a pile of my own wet, sloppy, stinky ass shit. 

SHIT.

I sat there in shock at my transgression. ""Holy fuck."" ""What the fuck do I do?"" All thoughts that were racing through my mind... So I did what any sane person would do. I sat in my own shit for 45 minutes and waited for my bus. 

My coach arrives, the shit now cold and wet on my ass, soaking through my blue jeans, luckily my jacket was just long enough to cover the patch of shit now visible through my jeans. 

Slowly and with an odd gait I make my way; shuffling towards the bus door. I just want this ordeal to be over. I pay the driver and walk swiftly to the back of the coach. A stench of demonic proportions wafting throughout the coach, filling every corner. I sit back down into my soggy wet shitty mess at the back of the busy coach.

It was the longest half an hour I have ever experienced. The stench becoming more and more pungent. As the bus pulled up to my stop I jumped to my feet and made my way quickly off of the coach. 

I quickly scrambled off the main road and took to the back streets to get home. I walked briskly to my house the shit now down my leg, cold and wet. 

I get to the front door and scramble for my keys, rifling through my pockets, searching. The shit now becoming more and more uncomfortable. I eventually bustle through my front door. I rip my trousers off, ice cold wet shit smearing down my legs and put them straight in the bin out back, along with my soiled underwear. 

I then proceeded to bath for a long time.  

Overall it was a shitty two days and I lost a pair of my favourite jeans.

So I go ahead and register with uk2.net, ""myfullname.com"".

It gets a little technical here, but is relevant to the fuckup.

The thing is that I already had my own hosting, with a VPS provider. I pointed the domain name to the IP address for my server, but I didn't have a website made yet. So I set up my server to redirect the URL to my Soundcloud, at least for the time being.

I put the URL onto my CV and sent it out to prospective employers.

Not too long after that, I found myself a job, forgot about the website and figured I would just let the domain expire. I also switched to another host, and didn't bother to setup the redirect again. So the URL wasn't doing anything, as far I knew.

Cue back to today. I get an email from uk2 to tell me my domain is due for renewal. Curious, I open up the URL again ""myactualfullname.com"". And what comes up? A picture of a guy pissing on another guy's face. Another picture of a guy being fisted while wearing leather bondage. ""Gay Fisting, Leather and Pissing"" in the title bar. Yep, my ""professional"" URL was directing to a gay porn site.

It turns out the IP address of my old server had been reinstated as the IP for a server hosting a porn site.

I quickly logged into uk2 and swapped the DNS servers back to defaults again and deleted the entires on the DNS server I was using. But anyone who understands this kind of stuff will tell you it can take a day or so before records get updated across the world. As of writing this, it still points to that site..

I have no idea how long it has been like that. Potentially a few months to half a year. I really hope no one found a copy of the CV I sent out in the past and decided to look it up..

It is my anniversary tomorrow, and my wife has been having mobility and fatigue problems for a while so I thought it would be a good idea to make her a nice dinner we could enjoy without going out. I picked a menu and for the dessert I selected a chocolate mousse that needs to be made and then chilled for a day, which suited me as I wouldn't have so much to do tomorrow.

So the wife goes for a nap, and this is my chance to get moussing: I melted the chocolate, and started whipping the egg whites. The whisk hasn't been used that recently and this foul brown gunk started dripping out the bottom. Shit. So after a bit of thought I settled on the idea that I would turn the whisk on it's side, lay a pan over the bowl to catch the splatters and the gunk would drip on the worktop, not in the egg whites. Of course, a huge pile of egg whites sprayed everywhere, including on the recipe book. While all this was happening the chocolate cooled and separated so not only did I make a huge mess, I think I've made the worst chocolate mousses in the history of chocolate mousse.

I have had iOS 7 for a few months and about a week ago, I installed iOS 7 GM on my phone. Well, today I found that I couldn't update to today's full release of it and I would have to use iTunes in order to update.

I got home at around 9:00 PM and starting downloading the latest version. Once downloaded, I started the update process. What happens? About 40 seconds in, and my phone bricks. My phone in now in recovery mode. iTunes tells me that some error happened and it failed to update. ""I'll just try downloading it from a different website. Perhaps I accidentally downloaded the wrong version. (CDMA, when I maybe needed the GSM version?) Wrong.  I delete what I previously downloaded, download the update once again, attempt to update and about a minute later, my phone crashes back into recovery mode. Nope. 

All right, so I had to have done something wrong. While, scratching my head thinking about what possibly could have gone wrong, I also delete the update I downloaded once again.  Let's see here, I attempted to update my phone from an update I downloaded to my E: drive. Whoops. Chrome's default download location is on my C: drive. All right, well, the update on my E: drive is the one I downloaded about a week ago, the GM version. I probably tried to update my phone to the same version it was already on, so that's why it probably happened. 

So, I continue on my train wreck, and I download it once again. I wait for the download to finish, and I make sure to update my phone using the file I had just downloaded. What happens again? Brick. I'm out of explanations for what happened , and decide to try once more, but to let iTunes handle all of the downloading directly from Apple's servers. This takes much less than I expected, about 15 minutes, and when it gets to the stage of updating, surprise, it bricks again. 

So I do some Googling. It turns out that I had literally nothing to gain from updating anyways. iOS 7 GM and the public release version are quite literally, the exact same thing. Down to the build number and all. I bet you can imagine how I feel right about now. Whoops, wasted 2 and a half hours for nothing, great, and my phone is useless for a while. Of course, Apple's servers are being hammered right now, so I shouldn't expect to get this problem resolved for a while.

Sadly, I did not execute it that well. And though you are partly to blame, I am not mad at you. Ya see here is what you need to know. The minute, the exact minute I grabbed the paper, the door to your apartment at the bottom of the stairs shut, quite loudly I must say. I was so caught off guard I kept leaning forward as my brain struggled to make sense of the physical nature I was involved in. Meanwhile, my body essentially decided to do a cartwheel, then a somersault, then a backwards somersault, followed by an almost flawless swan pose for a second or two (I just went with it), whereupon I concluded the fall down the stairs completely naked with botched backflip, one that somehow left your face in the area I use to excrete the byproducts of metabolizing food.
 
Struggling to get up, as you screamed, I hit my head on the bottom of a fire extinguisher metallic compartment, and honestly, the alone hurt like a mother. Bleeding at the crown of my eye, blood poured down to my forehead and face as my one foot caught in the railing as well as your Dolce Gabana Light Blue perfume made it extremely difficult to get off you. Not sure how, but somehow, someway, my morning wood was still prevalent and I know this is the wrong time to make note of it, but right then and there I chalked it up to a recent increase I'm Fiber.
 
Who knows?
 
It doesn't matter how this all ended. And any way, the detective seemed more suspicious of the fact I still read that the newspaper more so than my bad luck, but no charges were pressed. I heard you were taken to Rush Hospitals ""Where PPO's mean more"" to be evaluated for some sort of shock or post traumatic stress which was ironic because in a way you were probably stressed out just from me falling on you naked! Right? Noting this weird occurrence to our building manager, he shook his head and asked if I had read Of Mice And Men. I said no to which he replied I should be treated like the idiot ae the end of the story. I am guessing this was the novel that was made into Forrest Gump? I dunno... Whatever. Look, I live right upstairs. Come over after work and let's listen to some CCR and see where the Franzia takes us.

The wipe up room supervisor was ripping the shrink wrap off a pallet of Namibian beef when I let rip, it smelled so bad that he recoiled in horror and swore loudly in Polish and got a manager insisting that the meat was bad and had to go back on the lorry to the supplier. The manager caught a whiff of the lingering cloud of foul death and agreed that the meat was indeed putrefying and indeed needed to go back.

johnknoefler,9,25,1mnlh6,67,"So this happened quite a while back. Most of my relatives are beekeepers. Some are huge commercial operations. I was working for a relative and he had a foreman who happened to be a long time family friend. 
So we are out in the field working on hives and bent over looking for queen bees so we could split up hives to make new hives. Now keep in mind this guy is a bit weird in some ways that I never suspected. I always tie shoe laces around the bottom of my trousers so I won't have a bee wandering up my leg and causing a panic. I never saw the foreman use such tactics. 
I found out that day he went without underwear as well. So anyway, he suddenly stands up and looks at me with a shocked expression of panic. Then he hauls off and smacks himself right in the nuts as hard as he can with an open palm. He goes down on his knees again and stays there groaning. Of course I am all puzzled and surprised as I never saw anyone ever do this in my life. 
After he recovers I ask him what happened and he informs me  a bee just tried wandered up on his family jewels all aggressive and wanting to sting where it really hurts. So he shakes and maneuvers until he is sure the dead bee is safely back down his pant leg. 

A couple days go by and we are back in the same yard repeating the process on some more hives. Splitting them up to create new hives. He and I are again faced off in two nearby sections. All is peaceful with the droning of the bees and the warm sun on our backs. Perfect blissful working day. Suddenly he bolts upright like he did last time. All panicked and wild eyes. He raises his arm to again deliver the killing strike to his nuts and then suddenly stops in mid swing. Just standing there staring at me with his right arm frozen mid swing and that crazy panicked look of a deer in the headlights. Then he screams in agony and starts grabbing and squeezing his crotch. He goes down on his knees still screaming and he finally subsides to just groans of agony. He's still scrabbling at his crotch the whole time. Finally he gets it worked out the best he can and walks off to the orange orchards. He comes back later and tells me a bee actually stung him on the head of his penis. He can still hobble about the job and seems to recover during the day. I am just chocking on my laughter. He obviously didn't want to hit himself in the nuts like a couple days before. Later during lunch I remind him it might be a good idea to at least use some duct tape on his pant legs. 
As we are loading up to go home on that Friday he tells me he can't wait to get home as his prick is all swelled up and super sensitive and he wants to try it out with his wife for the most amazing sex he thinks he will ever have.

So this weekend I went out to a friend's house to drink. We were having a good time and I had quiet a bit to drink. In total maybe 5 beers, 3 shots of tequila, and a screwdriver. Since I live round the  corner they walk me back to my residence hall. I go in and wait get my stuff, because I promised my other friend's I'd stay over at their dorm room. (We are college students). My roomate ensures I get to the bus safe and I get on. Fast forward to their room, where I make it safe no problem. They make me go take a shower and ready myself for bed. I stumble around and leave clothes all over their floor, but other than that I showered and got ready fine by myself. 

At this point I should tell you that they live in a triple, and one of them was not present. He is a good friend of mine and he is gay, his name is anthony

So I sleep in Anthony's bed and pass out instantly no problem. Apparantley, according to his roomates who are also real good frineds of mine, I woke up and pissed in his desk. They told me that they were awoken to the sound of running water. 

Here is how it was told to me.

""I woke up to the sound of running water and I saw you in front of Anthony's desk, with your pants down. It's like six in the morning so I hope to God I'm dreaming. 

'Adam please tell me that is a waterbottle'

'It is don't worry about it'

'Adam let me see it.'

'Don't worry about it go back to bed.'

You then finished walked back to his bed and then stopped looked at me and said. 

'Don't worry, Anthony likes to play with penis juice anyway.'""

I was upsetto find out this was true so I spent my whole evening cleaning out his desk and airing out their room. I also had to dry out all the stuff that got wet.

This stuff is delicious and so fucking calorie-dense. A 340-gram bag (depending on the mix) contains over 2000 calories. That's how much you should eat in a day. If you're hungry and you get a hold of one of these bags, you could eat a day's worth of calories in a single sitting.

And I did just that. Twice. Upon realizing my mistake the first time around, I said I wouldn't open the second bag for a week, and then I would take it slowly.

But I got peckish a few days later. I thought to myself, ""just a couple of handfuls."" Before I knew it, 3/4s of the bag was gone. I've gained twelve pounds in the last few months, and this shit certainly isn't doing me any favors.

I cleaned it up really well, but today I noticed it was very inflamed, achey, and I squeezed it and it oozed pus. Ew. I researched cat bites, and of course was nearly convinced my arm was gonna get gangrene. So I went to the doctor, got a tetanus shot and antibiotics.

My_comments_count,157,320,1mjr1f,1133,"So my newlywed sister and husband are staying at our parents' house for the week. They just got here a day ago and since her and my brother moved out, my room is the only one that isn't used for storage. So they take my room (which is actually my brothers but I stole it when he left) and I took the basement. I like the basement, it's nice, cool and has a tv. Anyways, it was last night when we all went to bed and I was a little drunk off wine so I felt like looking at some porn. This is the part where I fucked up.

So i'm looking at porn on my tablet. It's an old tablet but I usually just use a remote desktop viewer to hook up with my computer so I can do everything a computer can do and my tablet just has to deal with the video. Well.....my computer was in my room. I knew this, but I also know that the monitors were off. I also was under the impression that the stereo hooked up to my computer was turned off as well. I ALSO knew that my tablet by default will turn off the computer sound and route the sound through my tablet. This all was true, except my brother-in-law had turned on my stereo for whatever reason. 

So I finish with my dirty deed with no problems. Sound never came through the speakers because I tested it beforehand, the monitors were off because I was able to see that there wasn't that blue glow coming out of my door. However, when I finished I didn't turn off the video or exit out of the web. I just accidentally and every so casually pressed the home button. So, there I am, 2 floors away, cum in a paper towel and wiping the excess off my nether region when I casually pressed the button and immediately I knew my mistake. Now I knew what could have happened but I was still thinking that I had turned the speakers off and no one turned them back on so i'd still be fine. 

so I waited

Two seconds later my speakers two floors up ignited with the sounds of a very nice lady getting absolutely wrecked by some big cock. Holy Shit. Not only did the sound come on but my loud ass studio speaker were turned all the way up and were right next to my bed where my sister an her husband were fast asleep. My neighbors probably thought we were having the loudest orgy ever. MY DAD FREAKED. He ran to my room, my brother-in-law was trying to turn the sound off but somehow turned the monitors on in the midst of things. So my dad has now walked in on my sister freaking out, my brother in law trying to unplug every outlet possible and see just some girl getting pounded making the loudest screams i've ever heard. 

Needless to say they knew it was me. They knew I did it and they knew it wasn't a joke. I just admitted to jerking it and I was sorry it went through the speakers. They were more mad at the fact that it scared the fucking shit out of everyone because some nice lady just started screaming at 1 in the morning at the loudest setting my speakers had. All in all it was probably the most embarrassing thing that has happened to me and IDK about you guys but there is something really embarrassing about anyone seeing what you get off to let alone my parents, sister and brother-in-law. 

TL;DR: I woke my whole house up to incredibly loud porn at 1 in the morning which I couldn't stop for a solid 120 seconds. I'll never know any longer time than those 120 seconds.

corncheds,30,81,1mhamj,244,"So this was a while ago. Whatevs. Still pretty fucked. 

So in high school, I played rugby (check my post history for a little surprise there). Like most school teams do, we had a rookie party after the season was over. The details of the party are unimportant, the only thing that matters is that I was 10/10 blackout. Straight assed. 

The next morning, my body turned on me. 

First was the shit. 

THE shit. 

I sat on the toilet and tried to avoid passing out from the smell emanating from the bowl below me. It was awful. It felt like I was puking out of my asshole. I wept. I prayed. It made me the man I am today. 

After that asscapade I knew wiping was out of the question, so I turned on the shower and spread em. A brown stream ran towards the drain as I let the warm water have it's way with me. All this time I thought, okay, this day might not be ruined yet. I might be clean. 

Then I popped a boner. 

Maybe it was the water on my bung hole. Maybe it was just morning wood. But whatever the reason, I thought to myself, *Hey, you know what would make you feel better? A quality jerk sesh.*

So jerk it I did. As I trucked along, I felt as though my headache was going away. This feeling was marvellous. I was healed. 

Then I came. 

As I finished my previous euphoria evaporated into nausea and shame, and my stomach began to turn. I puked and puked until I couldn't puke anymore. It splashed on my legs. It was horrific. I thought this was the worst morning of my life. *This has got to be the most awful thing I could imagine*. That was before I fell. 

My assorted bodily fluids had lubricated the floor, and my retching had done just enough to throw me off balance. I felt like that statue of Saddam. This time I did cry a bit. I only missed the tap by a couple inches, no doubt saving me a wicked conkie. I still shudder to think of my parents walking in on that scene.

tl;dr: I got in the shower clean and ended up covered in cum, puke, and shit. ","TIFU by nearly knocking myself out in a pile of my own shit, puke, and jizz. [NSFW]",325

patchy911,9,8,1mfj4z,18,"Like I said this was years ago but I was just talking about this story last night and I thought I'd share it here.

I was 14 and was hanging out with a friend walking around the woods behind our neighborhood.  We came across a 2x4 and were trying to figure out what stupid thing we could do with it.  We came across this 4x4 raised sewer drain and decided that we could catapult stuff off it using the sweet board we found.  It started off innocent enough with rocks and we were getting some really good distance with it when I spotted a toad.  I tell him to put it on and I'm going to send that baby packing.  I jump on the board and send that sucker flying through the air.  My friend laughing about how far it went says he wants to launch one too, because he knows he cant shoot it farther then I did.  And this is when karma decides to play it's little game.

We find another frog and place it on the board.  My friend is standing on the drain with his back turned to me waiting for me to tell him to go.  Well as you all know frogs jump and after I placed him on the board he hops off.  I tell my friend to ""hold on"" and bend down to pick him up to put it back on.  Well in his desire to do it he here's me say hold and assumes I'm saying go and jumps as high as he can landing on the board.  The 2x4 comes flying up and crashes into my skull.  It hit between my eye and my temple.  One inch lower and it would have hit me in my right eye and one inch higher and I would have probably been killed.  I immediately throw both hands up to my head cupping around my eye.  I pull both hands down to see if I'm bleeding a little only to see a pool of blood in my hands.  I rip my my white shirt off and get my mom to take me to the hospital, which is where I learned about how lucky the placement of the injury was.  By the time we got there my white shirt had been completely stained red.  10 stitches later and I realized that catapulting frogs is not the best idea.

terriblethief,16,16,1mf7qn,69,"Tonight I ran into an old friend (let's call her A) on the street as I was walking to a party. I hadn't seen her in months so she gave me a huge extended hug. We then parted ways so we could get to the party. Skip ahead a few hours and I feel like going home. I get a text from A saying that she was free and she would be down to hang out. It's pretty late at night so I thought it was odd that she was texting me but I figured that she wanted to catch up so I asked her what she wanted to do. She ended up coming to my dorm and we smoked some weed. My roommate was in sleeping and we couldn't chill in my room, so she invited me back to her apartment a few blocks away. We go into her room and sit down on her bed. Her friend calls her wanting to talk and come over, but she pretended to be sleeping so she wouldn't have to talk on the phone. Tension is in the air. Small talk is had. I scoot closer to her on the bed. She turns her body to face me. She's smiling and looking right into my eyes. I scoot even closer. I lean in. I close my eyes. I kiss her. No reciprocation. As I pull away and she's staring wide eyed at me. 


""Wh...why did you do that?"" 

I couldn't answer her and my face went beet red. I thought it would be rude of me to get up and just leave so we sat as I rambled on about how awkward the past five minutes had been. I realized then that I was staying way too long. As I put my shoes on, she leans over to me and says, 


""You're the one who stopped.""

Rager133,6,23,1mf19p,4,"Okay, so here's a little bit about me. I'm a sophomore in high school, I am an audiophile, you'll hardly ever see me off of my phone, 16 years old, I'm skinny, white with a light tan, and I'm rockin' dem glasses. I don't look like much of the geek/nerd you'd think of though. Put me in the right clothes, get my hair perfect and *damn I'm good.* My biggest problem is that I'm real shy and anti-social. 

I've been in band since 7th grade, loved it since then and don't plan to quit anytime soon. Being obsessed with music like I am, I've never had the thought of dating pass my mind *once*. I would walk down the halls seeing all these couples and best friends, didn't care. Music was *my* girlfriend at the time. ^Loner ^alert.

This was all until freshman year though. There was about 3 months left in the school year, just about to be getting into UIL contests and other crap for band. Nothing new. Well I walk into band one day, get my stuff ready and stand my lonely ass by my marimba. (Should have mentioned earlier, percussionist here) My director gets everybody quiet, and begins to announce we have a new student that's in band as well. In band, a *percussionist*, and a girl. So of course I'm checking around the room, fixing myself up, and in walks this, perfect, quiet, cute, dark haired girl. After giving her a warm welcome, blah blah telling where shes from and etc. She decides to pick a spot in the percussion section. By *me*. I'm trying to act chill and everything. I wanted to look at her more but didn't wanna be a creep. It was pretty hard.

Fast forward to UIL time. We still haven't said much at all, just the average ""Hi Bob, how was your day Bob? That's great, well I'll see you later, Bob."" everyday. (My name isn't Bob, in case you're wondering. It's Shelby. ^Named ^after ^Carroll ^Shelby) Things do start to pick up though, we begin to talk a lot, keep getting in trouble together, laugh at each other's stupid jokes, and grin stupidly just at the sight of each other. We have so much in common it's not even funny. I was seriously feeling attached to someone for the first time ever. I waned to date her, but I was too afraid if I did so late in the year and so early in her new arrival to town, it would smother her or maybe even run her off. So we just sat on the edge of being troublesome friends until the end of the year.

The end of the year, oh lord the saddest day of my life. She was across the band hall, with some of the other lesser friends she knew. All female, nothing for me to worry about. I had yet to get her number. Time was running out, I knew her so well, we were such great friends and loved talking, what would be the problem of giving her my number or getting hers?? I sit alone, doodling on a paper, scribbling my thoughts, and what do you know, 1 second in my time was a minute in reality. The bell rings, everyone screams, and It's goodbye Ms. Sullivan. (Not her name either)

What is this, Chapter 2? Alright let's do it, it should be a short one. The summer. Most unproductive and lazy time of my life. Wake up, eat, sit my ass on a computer redditing with some occasional steam gaming, eat, reddit, sleep. I don't have Hannah's (her name, now you know, yay) number, address, skype, any contact what so ever. Then it hits me, facebook. I use it, I'm sure she does. I look her up and it made me feel so good to see that face of hers. Upon looking on her wall a bit, it appears she hasn't used facebook in AGES. Well this sucks, I continue browsing her wall, info, and what not. (It's not, creepy) After a while I decide to send a friend request anyway. It's now and something or never and nothing. 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, a week, 2 weeks, 1 month, that request was pending for so long, I woke up every morning and that was the first thing I had checked. Continue my summer laziness and percussion camp starts. Nothing happens here really so I'll skip a bit. She finally answers the request and we start messaging each other. Skipskipskip I finally get her number. So now we start texting each other. Restoring what we had, telling what was lost.

Full summer band starts, and it turns out shes in colorguard. That's okay I guess. Still with the band. We start hanging out a lot together, almost inseparable. There we-skipskipskipskip. Next chapter.

The new school year has started now. Dreadful time for 1-5 friends me. I work behind the counter at what we have called a Youth Center. Basically just a separate building on campus, for lunch period, stuff, activities, food and what not. I'm working one day, I look up, and I see Hannah sitting alone at a table. Not even doing anything, just like dwindling her thumbs and staring blatantly. I felt so bad, everyone else in the room was in a group or at least had SOMEONE to chat with. The deal with me working in the youth center was that it isn't mandatory at all. I can work whenever I want. The trade is: I do work, free food. Great. That day I kept zoning in and out staring at her, should I go? Stay? No? Yes? Ugh. Worst case of cold feet ever. Skip to next week, we start talking face to face some more, and schedule when and where we can meet-up together for lunch. It's going good. Not for long though. One day in after school band practice, while on break, I couldn't find her. The place we usually meet at was empty. I go there anyway and keep scanning the crowd of sweaty, frustrated, brass, drumline and woodwind players. BAM there it was, her face. Saw it. Cool, maybe she was just talking about something with her instructor-teacher-director-person. I look again. No, that wasn't it at all. She's with another guy for the first time, as latched on to him as she has been with me. This really unsettles me, but I stay in our little spot and keep waiting. 

Break is over, day is over, week is over, blah. From that day on she had started talking to me less, only when she happened to pass by. Now *I* was the lonely one, sitting alone, dwindling my thumbs. Now you're probably wondering who this ""other guy"" is. This other guy is my own very good friend that I've known since 7th grade. Aaron. We've never had any trouble whatsoever. Well 2 or so weeks go by and I'm getting really tired of getting my pride taken away. I couldn't tell if they were dating or not at this point. So I message him ""Y u do dis?""  as a shy playful cover up for ""What the fuck dude, quit taking her away from me"" and we continue a small stupid conversation, but then he cuts me short and says ""I was playing dumb earlier. I know what's going on."" So of course a long emotional apologetic conversation ensues, and it turns out Hannah nor Aaron had any idea how I felt and what I had tried and done. I went through like a week of depression/not talking to ANYONE, but now everything is all good. I'm gonna start wrapping myself up in my first four songs I'm making (I'm a very very low profile DJ and soon to be producer, still acquiring equipment) and I wanna try to forget I ever felt that way. My dad always said ""If you don't speak up life is just gonna pass you by and you're gonna hate yourself for it."" Damn I hate myself for this. Anyway that's my story. I just checked facebook and they are in fact in a relationship now. *sigh*

I spend fifteen minutes getting ready to leave and decide that, since I have a little time, I should go to Starbucks and grab a coffee. Upon entering I see the EXTREMELY attractive counter worker (let's just call him Matt) making coffees. In my jittery excited state I walk up to the counter and order my cup of coffee and a slice of pumpkin bread from   the employee taking orders. The employee taking the orders tells Matt to get my pumpkin bread, to which he replies ""no"". I giggle as he gets the bread. He looks up and says ""Oh, but if it's for Jazziedax, of course."" with his super gorgeous smile. Now normally I wouldn't be fazed by this type of over enthusiastic counter service, but I haven't seen this guy since LAST SEMESTER and didn't give the employee taking orders my name.

So obviously, giggly me gets all flustered and flirts back with him, trying to keep cool under the gaze of his adorable hipster glasses.

I melt, in my silly 20 year old way and fumble my head phones into position, knocking my bow out of my hair. I stumble to pick it up and head out the door. Half way to the train station I realize I should probably print some papers before my train. I reach into my pocket to grab my keys to my dorm room and realize they're not there. So, I turn around and trudge back to the coffee shop and try my best to ask if I left my keys on the counter in the most adorable way possible. Matt just stares at me with a blank face and says ""yeah, well umm, you didn't leave them here..."" I turn red faced, bow still askew, looking like a flustered idiot and mumble something along the lines of ""Oh I must have left them in the car"" (I don't have a car on campus) and walk out the door.

I was in a Helping Relationship Psychology class where we were given a task to practice one on one relationships with people who had small and manageable problems. We were assigned to record our sessions so our professor could check on our responses and tell us how to better work on our methods.

I turned it in and thought little of it.

She tells me to take a seat and goes: ""Well, first of all, your file didn't work (she tried to open it with itunes I think and the audio file wasn't compatible), but more importantly, I have to ask you something.

I'm 19, and an utter loser for all intents and purposes. I stayed home alone every summer, all summer, for as long as I can remember, isolated because I lived out in the sticks with no Internet connection and lacking the social skills to make friends and girlfriends. When high-school hit, things improved a little since, from my grandparents, I received a laptop, a smart phone, and a 40"" flat-screen Sharp Aquos TV. I loved these things very much. They were nice, high tech things I'd never had, and they connected me with the outside world. I did a lot of browsing the Internet, talking to friends and family via tethered cell phone, with my beloved, beautiful TV as a monitor. 

Well, yesterday, I fucked up. Hard. My Dad and I have gotten into some awful fights in the past. He raised and took care of me on his own through personal and financial crisis after crisis, and I love him to death. Seriously, I fucking love my Dad, but some of the fights we've had are my most dreaded memories, feeling so hopelessly ashamed, frustrated, and angry with both of us makes for awful remembrance. 

Yesterday , I was having a pretty good day. We're set to move into a city apartment in a few days, where we'll both be less isolated and I can get a job. I'm happy about this fact. I was home alone, watched a movie on my gorgeous TV, browsing on my laptop, but something happened that I just don't understand. I started thinking about our awful fights, a big list of them. I was remembering things I didn't want to remember, intrusive thoughts that were just violating my good mood. I got angrier and angrier, just this shitty, sick anger with no outlet, and so much old frustration. I took my mouse and hurled it at my awesome TV, which took a hell of an impact and lost picture, just backlighting the blank screen with the bright white, circular impact crack. Furious at that, I took my laptop and flung it across the room, royally fucking it up, screen and innards. Still enraged and in disbelieving dread at the state of my electronics, I kicker the box fan out of my doorway, breaking one of its blades. 

I couldn't believe it. I still can't. I'm such a stupid, spoiled fucking brat. All these things I loved, I just up and wrecked, and I didn't even realize how much I loved having it until I had fucked it all up. These electronics meant more to me than I had ever even considered. 

My Dad gets home later and is totally livid. Telling me I'm fucking stupid, totally disappointed and angry. We had just watched a movie on it the other night. One of his favorite things to do is watch movies with me on the flat screen, since it's the only hdtv in the house, and he seems to think I don't love him, or that I hate him. He thinks that I think that he ruined my life. It couldn't be farther from the truth, and I love hanging out watching movies with my dad. Not only did I break my screen, I seem to have deeply wounded my dad's feelings by taking away the means to do one of the only things we do together. 

So, I ruined a great TV, I ruined my only pc, and I ruined my relationship with my Dad. All for some fucking memory fueled psycho attack that I can't even adequately explain. I'm a terrible, fully grown brat, a terrible son, and a terrible grandson. The fact that I destroyed these things shows that I didn't deserve them to begin with, and I can't believe I was such a stupid, spoiled child yesterday.

So I was alone one day for quite a few hours, and I was left to cook my own dinner. Now, I'm lazy, even for a seventeen year old, so I just got a large can of sweetcorn, a spoon, added salt and spent the afternoon slowly eating it whilst playing a bunch of SNES games. Living the fucking life.

The day after, I had to be up at four AM to catch a coach to Birmingham to play in a concert, along with several other youth orchestras from around the country. Now, at this point, I hadn't pooped for something like eleven hours after eating the corn, plus at least another 3 or 4 hours before I ate the corn, but I was running late so I had to pinch it back and soldier on to catch the coach.

Come 6AM, I'm on the coach, and I'm a fucking wreck. I had pins and needles all over, tunnel vision, my hands were shaking, I was borderline delirious, I needed a shit that badly. Unless you've been in the same situation I was in, you might think I'm exaggerating, but I'm sure some of you reading this will know the sheer pain of not being able to go poo for hours. Mercifully, the coach pulled over for petrol eventually and I had the most relieving dump ever. I thought that was the end of my problems, but no. Oh noooo.

I've lurked around TIFU for a while and it only dawned on me now that this might be a good story to share.  My family gets a good laugh out of it nowadays, so here you guys go:

When I was about five my parents (both far from religious) thought it'd be good to bring my younger sister and me to church just to see if we liked it. It was one of those churches where they do a fair bit of singing and put their hands up in the air. I'm getting a bit confused as to why people are putting their hands up, so I ask my dad. He doesn't know why, but he tells me that they're trying to get closer to God. Now at this point I had always thought that God was some magical ruler that lived up in the clouds, so hearing about these people trying to physically reach him seemed ridiculous. They were obviously never going to be able to reach him when they couldn't even reach the ceiling.  I needed to help these people. So, that's about when I started running around the church screaming ""PUT DOWN YOUR HANDS, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO REACH GOD!"" over and over and over again.  My parents were pretty embarrassed, a few people looked at me like I was the antichrist, my dad broke out into uncontrollable laughter, and we never went to church again.  I might have been a bit of a handful when I was a kid.

mynoshameaccount,2,11,1mawqw,10,"Backstory: My sister is moving out of state for a job and she had a going away party Saturday night. She's the oldest (29) and I'm the youngest (18, soon to be 19 at the end of the month) and we have two brothers in between. All four of us were at that party including a few of my cousins closer to my sister's age and a few of her friends I've known for years. Basically a lot of people I know well and love were there.

Since I hardly drank and went to parties in high school I thought I'd let loose that night. Little did I know my sister's friend who I had heard about and knew he was very handsome and older than me would be there. He has done business with my father and has treated my brother and sister for hypnotherapy which is his profession. He was very nice, charasmatic, funny, charming, and super handsome so I engaged him in conversation by asking a lot about hypnotherapy which I was genuinely curious to learn more about. As he talked I drank...a lot of sangria. The more liquid courage I had the more courageous and flirtatious I felt. Being an overweight girl who just lost 20 pounds with a cute dress on all dolled up, I felt confident and had little shame. In my defense 3 years ago he sort of tried to ask out my sister (she's overweight too, more so than me) before he knew she was engaged and we look like twins so I figured he'd at least see *something* in me even if he never acted upon it. I made it obvious I wanted his attention though I tried to be sublte in my drunken state. Even learning the fact that he graduated high school the year I was born hardly phased me. I didn't care, I was just flirting for fun! Big fucking red flag there other than the fact that he's associated with my family.

We even sang karaoke together. He picked Lady Gaga's, ""Bad Romance"" which I thought was appropriate in a hypothetical situation if we ever dated, which would never happen. But it was fun and we both had a good time singing horribly.

By the end of the night we exchanged business cards since I considered hypnotherapy in the past and he asked for mine since I'm a makeup artist and he said there could be a time when he needs a makeup artist for videos or photo shoots for advertising his business. I didn't think it would go any where with the business cards so I didn't think much of it at all. 

Next day, I remembered what had happened and felt extremely embarassed for what my family and friends witnessed even though they lightly joked about it. Still, I was embarassed that I, a young college girl, tried to flirt with a man twice my age who was out of my league and probably has tons of better looking women closer to his age throwing themselves at him. Overall I thought he was pretty neutral with his responses to my flirting which was all vocal, not at all physical, so I thought I was safe in a sense not having scared him away.

Then a friend of mine talked me into sending him a facebook friend request and I said I'd wait at least a couple of days. So today I did it in the afternoon and a few hours later checked his profile to see that what had said ""friend requested"" went back to ""add friend"" and I basically got rejected. Now I feel like a dumbass for it. I'm hoping if I ever see him at events that it won't be awkward and he won't judge me but I doubt that will be the case. The alternative would be avoiding him all together.

The only good thing about this is the subtle rejection killed my obsessive infatuation and now I can actually focus on my obligations which I wasn't able to do since the party. I couldn't help it before and I thought about him a lot in the past couple of days since the party but now I'm back to reality though when I first saw it, it was a huge blow to my self-esteem which is low to begin with. I'll just learn from this and try hard to work on that and not make that mistake again! I am a little worried he might say something to my sister about this and share his judgements which she would rub in my face for the next 20 years and have fun making me feel even more shitty about this whole thing. I also now see that I think I was so infatuated with him because he would be my ideal man later in life; basically *""husband material""* though I am at times attracted to older men who are attractive but *way* too old for me to date. 

**TDLR: Met a family friend twice my age at a party with some of my loved ones present and tried to flirt with him while I was very drunk. Tried to friend request him on facebook, basically got rejected within hours. Despite this being my anonymous account where I say things as if I weren't ashamed, I am now.**

EDIT: While trying to google something for my brother on my home computer my sister's facebook was open and this guy's name was at the top of list of people online.

http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1m9vrn/are_there_real_physical_dangers_in_eating/

The guy that runs our local nerd store has a tendency to get on obsessive kicks.  It started with energy drinks - to support his energy drink habit, he would sell energy drinks so he could get them cheap.  This evolved into hand sanitizer, cigars, and eventually a variety of hot sauces.  He offered a very wide variety of sauces, nearly none of which I have ever seen elsewhere.

One day one of the regulars comes in (let's call him Dummy) and sees the sauces.  He immediately starts bragging about how he can handle any sauce and how he's drunk several different kinds before.  No one eggs him on, just kind of a ""cool story bro"" type situation with this guy, as he does this a lot.  He won't let it go though and keeps insisting that he could drink the hottest sauce in the store.

On top of one of the display cases was the hottest sauce that the store had.  It was in a glass skull and sealed with wax.  The container was about 2 oz. and came with an eye dropper.  Directions said to use one drop per gallon of whatever liquid to which it was being added.  There was a warning label that rivals those on some industrial machinery and a Scoville rating over 1 million.  Dummy decides he is going to drink the whole thing.

Lucky for Dummy we manage to talk him down from actually drinking the stuff and convince him to just use the eye dropper.  Within a few seconds there are tears running down his face, his eyes are red and he's making very strange noises.  The guy chokes the stuff down and recovers a little, but his lips and tongue both start swelling pretty bad.  He ended up leaving pretty quickly after that and we didn't hear from him for a couple weeks.

We heard a little while later that he had developed huge blisters on his tongue and throat and he had trouble eating for a while.  I don't think I ever actually saw the guy again after the incident.  There were reports that he ended up in the hospital for a while because he couldn't breath from the damage to his throat, but I don't know if that part is true.

I tell them, ""Don't do it guys, I can't afford another hospital stay or an ambulance ride. I'm fine. Just help me up. What happened?""

I knocked myself out with my own bat. And I have work tomorrow.",TIFU by getting drunk and playing sports.,68
My_shit_account,9,8,1maocb,9,"this was a couple days ago, but just now found out whats going on awhile ago. So I was taking a regular dump a couple nights ago and while taking it, there was a bit of s sharp part to it.(not sure if anyone else has ever felt that, but it feels like a blade is hidden in your shit) So nothing big, and it passes by unnoticed and its just a usual day. So the rest of the day is fine. No problemo. So later that night, my asshole starts hurting. Not like really bad, but like a sore feeling. So my initial thought was ""Maybe I totally missed a spot while wiping, I dunno"" so I go in, re wipe, nothing. I'm a little stumped, but for now, I'll leave it alone. I wake up the next morning, and it still hurts, but a little more. So by this time, my curiosity is peaked enough to where I reach down there, and find if I can feel what's going on. Then, I suddenly feel this bump. Bigger than any bump my asshole should ever have. Let me be clear here. My. Asshole. Not between my cheeks, but my actual muscles that retract when I shit. So now I'm all like How the hell did a zit get there? so I pinch it as hard as I can without screaming, and it just kinda rolls under my finger, no pus, water, nothing.(At this moment I imagined the bump saying ""lol, no"") Ok, so this fucking think is way too big to be an undeveloped zit, I've only got one choice. To spread my cheeks like I'm in a goddamn porno in front of my full body mirror on my bedroom door. So I look at it, and its just a big black bump. Then it hit me, Its a fucking blood blister. ON/IN MY ASSHOLE!(or so I think, im like 80% sure) So now I can't clench my butt or it'll flare up, and sitting down isn't exactly comfortable. I don't know what to do....",TIFU by taking the strangest shit of my life so far,17
8nate,7,4,1manoy,0,"It's not as bad as it sounds, actually. I was smoking a cig outside my friend's house with some people. My yellow crack lighter, which I had been trying to kill for some time, finally died, so I celebrated by whipping it against a wall a few feet in front of me. It didn't explode, but my friends freaked out at me. Some people where more understading and explained the principle of exploding lighters. For some reason, I never figured that lighters explode when slammed against something really hard. It seems obvious, of course. It's full of flammable liquid and would explode if it slammed against something. I mean, the lighter was dead, so I figured it wouldn't matter. Appearently, it's common knowledge. And that's it. Had to put it down somewhere.",TIFU by throwing my lighter against the wall really hard.,2
StinginPlatypus,33,49,1mafni,157,"First of all, I'm typing this on my phone, so I apologize for any spelling/grammar errors in advance.

Okay, so, I'm in high school, and I was just happily going about my day until I get into my music period, which is my second to last period. It's pretty great, we just sit around and play music blah blah. So, I lent my friend one of my guitar picks, and at the end of class she came to give it back. Now I had totally forgotten about it, and instead of giving it back she thought it would be funny to drop down my shirt. So she did. 

The guitar pick fell through my shirt, and into my pants. I knew it was there, but I couldn't grab it, because I was standing in the middle of class and was not going to stick my hand down my pants and feel around my ass to find it. I figured it'd just fall out through my shorts eventually, so I just started heading towards my next class.

Only it didn't fall out through my shorts.

No, no, it got stuck in my underwear and decided to lodge itself into my asscrack. Now, for some stupid reason, instead of heading to the bathroom and pulling it out then and there, I decided to just keep going to class. When I get there, I notice a problem for the first time.

If I sit down, that little fucker is gonna fly up my ass like a penis in a porno. 

But I decide to do it anyways. I sit, and that bitch does exactly that. At this point, I figure I should excuse myself to the restroom and get I out, but I'm worried that it will get too deep in to get out if I do, because the nearest bathroom was far away. So I make a decision.

I'm pulling that fucker out.

I reached into my pants while sitting down, squirm a little, and stick my fingers in my asscheecks. I feel around for a second, find the bastard, and rip it out. My fingers emerge slightly wet, smelly, and with a guitar pick in hand. Then a thought hits me... 

I was just squirming around in a chair, with my hand in my ass, and then pulled out a guitar pick. Fuck. 

TLDR; I got a guitar pick stuck in my ass, pulled it out, and now fear being known as the guy who fingers his own asshole in class. 

EDIT: Of course, my most upvoted post ever is a self post about getting a guitar pick stuck in my ass. ",TIFU by accidentally getting a guitar pick stuck in my asshole.,206
wutangsamurai,0,3,1maem5,4,"so today i was supposed to be finished reading a philosophy article for my morals class, needless to say i didn't.  i had a bunch of logic reading to do and thought id do it as it was more difficult.  today i get to class and during discussion im thinking of a counter example to a problem.  i get picked and tell the class my theoretical situation.  she laughs called me out on not doing the reading, and says thats exactly the situation the author used in her article.  i was quite embarrassed.  **I literally blushed so hard that my glasses fogged up** completely.  i was all flushed and had sweat on my brow too.  jeez im dumb.  ill keep my mouth shut next time i dont do an assignment.",TIFU by not reading,7
jordanzzz,2,12,1mae50,13,"Well. Today is my birthday was headed out to get food with the wife and some friends, got to the restaurant and we found a 20$ bill on the ground, I picked it up excited that I had found 20 bucks. Turned out when I got home, that it must have been my 20 bucks, and that the other 80 I had plus a 30 dollar check from my grandparents, is missing.  So now I'm broke on my birthday.  Figure it must have happened when I pulled my phone out of my pocket or something that the cash and check came out with it.

Numl0k,45,101,1mady7,349,"I got done running a few miles and didn't feel like cooking, so I ordered a pizza. Didn't change out of my workout clothes and went to smoke a bowl while waiting for my delicious 'za to arrive. As I'm finishing my bowl I hear the doorbell, so I ash out the bowl and stick it into the pocket of my shorts. I sign the receipt and receive my pizza. I stop the guy before he gets off the porch so I can give him a tip, but it takes me a few seconds to fish it out of my pocket. I see him look at me, and really quickly turn away with a strange look on his face. Not sure what it was all about at the time, but I hand him his tip and go back inside. I look down to realize that my pipe was laying in the pocket of my very-lightweight shorts, making it look distinctly like an erect dick. Perfect head outline and clear shaft pointing right towards my real (And quite flaccid, I assure you.) penis. It must have looked like I was going for *my* tip while I was going for *his* tip.

Suddenly, staring at my boss's face as he was talking to me, I forgot who he was, who I was, and what I was doing. I began looking around, confused, and he interrupted his banter to ask me if I was feeling all right. I looked at him, became slightly angry, and said no, I don't, and I don't appreciate his tone.

So background, I'm in English I'm one of the four boys in a class of 25+ with a very sensitive easily offended teacher. We are looking at images of the grievously wounded that got facial reconstruction surgery during world war one. An image of a burn victim comes up and he looked kind of like a cheesy alien so I chuckle, now I've been sick the last while so I immediately chough and wheeze so it just seemed like I just coughed weird. My teacher did not buy it, she stared at me and said are you laughing  at the burn victim? At this point my friend let's call him Nate starts laughing while the other members of the class glare at me FUCK! My immediate response was well he looked like an alien and it was funny, fuck me, well at least I didn't shit my pants or get caught jacking it link the rest of you guys.",TIFU by laughing at a burn victim.,13
