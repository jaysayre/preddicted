You could even fake books, or ask me about books I don't own, I'd be able to tell you yes or no. However, if you asked me to list all my books and write it on a piece of paper, I'd be lucky to get 25% of them before running out of steam. 

Furthermore, when prompted with the book name, I could tell you the general plot of the book, list characters, describe the physical book, and maybe even when and where I got it.

Ruiner,770,3932,w0qgf,2410,"In a few hours, we will have an official announcement from the CERN teams about the searches for the Higgs boson. I'll update this afterwards.

(You should also check [the previous Higgs thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/naxmk/the_everything_you_need_to_know_about_the_higgs/) where many of the common questions were answered)

For many reasons, this is a very exciting moment for everyone in the community. Many of the older folks spent their life constructing all the building blocks of what we now know as the ""standard model of particle physics"", and the discovery of the Higgs ends this big chapter in our understanding of nature. For us younger physicists, this might be the first and only occasion in our lifetimes in which we get to witness a major experimental discovery in particle physics. 


The LHC was built because we were **sure** that something would be found, since the theory for electro-weak interactions without the Higgs becomes completely unpredictive once we cross this energy range. Since [W bosons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons) are massive, they carry an extra degree of freedom - while light has 2 polarizations, both transverse to the direction of propagation of the light beam, W are also polarized in the direction parallel to their propagation. This longitudinal degree of freedom is troublesome, since it makes the probability of collision of W bosons collide grow very fast with the energy, so fast that it crosses the ""unitarity scale"", meaning that the sum of all the probabilities of different ways in which W bosons interact no longer add to 1.


When this happens, we need to ""resolve"" the interactions. This means that, while at large distances what we see is two W colliding, at short distances the Ws can also produces a particle and this particle again decays into Ws. Summing up all these contributions, we have again something finite. (Check the last 3 of these [diagrams](http://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img191.gif))


The Higgs - or whatever particle is in there at 126GeV - is very heavy and decays almost immediately into some lighter particles, so we cannot really produce it as a final state, thus we need indirect ways of detecting it. Check the above diagrams again: you see that the presence of the Higgs changes the ways in which the W bosons can scatter, so we can look for these signals. W bosons are also too heavy to be produced as a final state, so we need something else. We start by shooting protons against each other, and these protons contain 3 quarks each. The quarks can emit W bosons, and the W can also collide and produce a Higgs, as can be seen in this [diagram](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HGd0kIqlg9c/TzHA08T1kSI/AAAAAAAAAk4/oCfwX1eseKQ/s1600/vbf.png). Once the Higgs is produced, it will immediately decay into some light final state such as photons or quarks. What we really observe is an excess in the production of any of these final states when compared to the predictions of the same scattering without the Higgs. And in order to determine if the Higgs is really the Higgs, we compare the ""branching ratios"" of the theory with the experiment, which means that it has to produce just the ""right ammount"" of each final state.  


So is this guy also responsible for giving a mass to all the particles? Yes and no. In the real construction, the Higgs particle is part of something called the Higgs mechanism. In this mechanism, the energy is minimized once the Higgs field fills the whole space with a Higgs condensate: the field has a ""vacuum expectation value"", and the actual Higgs boson are just the excitations of this field, like ripples on the water. Almost every particle interacts with this field, and by this interaction they become massive.



* What changed since the last announcement?

Now they have more data and it's possible to say with a lot more certainty that there is in fact some particle with a mass of around 126 GeV. We'll have to wait until the announcement to know exactly how certain it is, but it's likely to be already above 5 sigma, so we can celebrate.

edit: 
now we have

from CMS: 125.3 +/- 0.6 GeV @ 4.9 sigma

from Atlas: 126.5 Gev @ 5.0 sigma



* Is it the Higgs?

It's needed more data. But their result seems to be compatible with the standard model Higgs.


* What now?

If it's really a Higgs, then we need to solve the Hierarchy problem or abandon the idea of naturalness. The problem is that the Higgs is ""unaturally light"", since quantum corrections would ""naturally"" make the Higgs mass as big as the Planck scale (10^19 GeV compared to the 126) and to make it light we need a an arbitrary cancellation that is heavily fine-tuned. The best candidates were supersymmetry and large extra dimensions, but it seems that both are very unlikely now.

If it's not a Higgs, then we probably will see more signals in the future, and the greatest theoretical challenge will be to figure out what exactly it is!",The official Higgs announcement thread.,6342

**EDIT 2**:
First off, THANK YOU for all the great questions! I'm having a lot of fun reading these. I just finished dinner and am back. Secondly, thank you for the votes on the wedding boutique photo! Yahoo!


There are a lot of common questions in this thread that I would like to address up here.

* Book List (good general reads that give you a sense of how research and discovery go in paleontology):

-*Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up To Date Encyclopedia For Dinosaur Lovers Of All Ages* by Dr. Thomas Holtz.

-*The Evolution and Extinction of Dinosaurs* by David Weishampel

-*Dinosaurs of the Flaming Cliffs* by Michael Novacek

-*Digging Dinosaurs*, *The Complete T. rex* and *Dinosaur Lives* by Jack Horner

-*Quest for the African Dinosaurs* by Louis Jacobs

-*Hunting Dinosaurs* by Louis Psihoyos

-*Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters* by Donald Prothero

-*The Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt* by William Nothdrurft

* **Advice concerning classes/school/college/how to be a paleontologist:**

Well, to get right to it, a good paleontologist is good at both geology and biology. When I was in college, this was my course list:

Physical Geology

Physical Geography

Mineralogy

Igneous, Metamorphic and Sedimentary Petrology

Sedimentology and Stratigraphy

Geomorphology

Structural Geology

That covers the geology side, more or less. I had a few electives (meteorology, oceanography, tectonics). You really need a good solid base in geology to understand how time is recorded in the rock!

My paleo courses consisted of the following:

Vertebrate Paleontology

'Invertebrate Paleontology

Paleontology Lab Techniques

Taphonomy

Macroevolution and the Fossil Record

Geobiology

Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy

Dinosaurs (A 101 class I took for fun ;) )

Paleontology is as competitive as any other field. People make a big fuss about jobs being tight, and they're not wrong, but I find that there is a lot of work out there, it isn't all in Academia- you can work with museum collections, consulting companies, and colleges or private institutions.

What's it like being a paleontologist? Well, sometimes there's nothing more rewarding or more stressful. I love it. It's hard work and the science is challenging sometimes, but the most important thing to remember is to keep yourself motivated. If you want to do it, DO IT. Don't look to others for confirmation or support. Support yourself. Be confident in your decisions, and never stop learning. I saw a lot of students begin a paleontology major who did not anticipate the hard-core scientific load they were undertaking. There is a lot of difficult coursework with paleontology. It's not just ""dinosaur appreciation club"". You need to know your shit. You will have to put up with a lot of crap that you don't like. I had to retake calculus 1 five times before I finally passed. Don't get stuck thinking ""why do I need this?"". That is a waste of time, and it will only distract you and drain your energy. Focus on what else you could be doing with your time. Don't be a book worm, either- get out of the classroom and get field experience. Lots of museums look for volunteers for the summer. You don't have to pay to go on an excavation. Take the time to track down some paleontology professors. Hamper them (without being irritating ;) ) and get to know them. A lot of times they will have research projects that you can assist on, and THAT will get you into grad school better than straight A's.

Ruiner,464,1689,naxmk,1542,"Since the Cern announcement is coming in 1 hour or so, I thought it would be nice to compile a FAQ about the Higgs and let this thread open so you guys could ask further questions.

1) **Why we need the Higgs:**

We know that the carriers of the weak interaction - the W and Z bosons - are ~~massless~~ massive (typo).  We observed that experimentally. We could just write down the theory and state that these particles have a ""hard mass"", but then we'd go into troubles. The problems with the theory of a massive gauge boson is similar to problem of ""naive quantum gravity"", when we go to high energies and try to compute the probability of scattering events, we break ""unitarity"": probabilities no longer add to 1. 

The way to cure this problem is by adding a particle that mediates the interaction. In this case, the interaction of the W is not done directly, but it's mediated by a spin-0 particle, called the Higgs boson.

2) **Higgs boson and Higgs field**

In order for the Higgs to be able to give mass to the other particles, it develops a ""vacuum expectation value"". It literally means that the vacuum is filled with something called the Higgs field, and the reason why these particles have mass is because while they propagate, they are swimming in this Higgs field, and this interaction gives them inertia. 

But this doesn't happen to all the particles, only to the ones that are able to interact with the Higgs field. Photons and neutrinos, for instance, don't care about the Higgs.

In order to actually verify this model, we need to produce an excitation of the field. This excitation is what we call the Higgs boson. That's easy to understand if you think in terms of electromagnetism: suppose that you have a very big electric field everywhere: you want to check its properties, so you produce a disturbance in the electric field by moving around a charge. What you get is a propagating wave - a disturbance in the EM field, which we call a photon. 

3) **Does that mean that we have a theory of everything?**

No, see responses [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/na0tp/if_evidence_of_the_higgs_is_released_on_tuesday/).

4) **What's the difference between Higgs and gravitons?**

Answered [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nafdw/whats_the_difference_between_the_higgs_boson_and/).

5) **What does this mean for particle physics?**

It means that the Standard Model, the model that describes weak, electromagnetic and strong nuclear interactions is *almost* complete. But that's not everything: we still have to explain how Neutrinos get masses (the neutrino oscillations problem) and also explain why the Higgs mass is so small compared to the Planck mass (the Hierarchy problem). So just discovering the Higgs would also be somewhat bittersweet, since it would shed no light on these two subjects.

6) **Are there alternatives to the Higgs?**

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgsless_model). Short answer: no phenomenological viable alternative. Just good ideas, but no model that has the same predictive power of the Higgs. CockroachED pointed out this other reddit thread on the subject: http://redd.it/mwuqi

7) **Why do we care about it?**

Ongoing discussion on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nawxu/my_partner_asked_me_why_we_should_be_interested/) thread. My 2cents: We don't know, but the only way to know is by researching it. 60 years ago when Dirac was conjecturing about the Dirac sea and antiparticles, he had no clue that today we would have PET scans working on that principle. 

EDIT: Technical points to those who are familiar with QFT:

Yes, neutrinos do have mass! But in the standard Higgs electro-weak sector, they do not couple to the Higgs. That was actually regarded first as a nice prediction of the Higgs mechanism, since neutrinos were thought to be massless formerly, but now we know that they have a very very very small mass. 

No, Gauge Invariance is not the reason why you need Higgs. For those who are unfamiliar, you can use the Stückelberg Language to describe massive vector bosons, which is essentially the same as taking the self-coupling of the Higgs to infinity and you're left with the Non-Linear Sigma Model of the Goldstones in SU(2). But we know that this is not renormalizable and violates perturbative unitarity.

Our research from [The Rohwer Lab](http://phuckitphage.org/) at [San Diego State University](http://newscenter.sdsu.edu/sdsu_newscenter/news.aspx?s=74269) investigates a new symbiosis formed between bacteriophage, which are tiny viruses that only infect and kill bacteria, and mucus, the slimy, protective coating found in your mouth, lungs, gut, and also on a large number of other animals, such as fish, corals, and worms.

We show that bacteriophage, or phage for short, stick to mucus surfaces across a diverse range of organisms. They do this by displaying an immunoglobulin-like protein fold on their capsid, or head, which grabs hold of sugars found within mucus. These mucus-adherent phage reduce the number of bacteria that grow on 
mucosal surfaces and protect the underlying animal host from infection.

This symbiotic interaction benefits the mucus-producing animal host by limiting mucosal bacterial infections, and benefits the mucus-adherent phage through more frequent interactions with bacterial hosts. We call this symbiosis/immunity, Bacteriophage Adherence to Mucus, or BAM for short. BAM could have significant impacts across a diverse number of fields, including, human immunity, prevention of mucosal infections, phage therapy, and environmental/biotechnology applications.

Dear AskScience,

First of all, thank you for once again interacting with my students and *me*!  You're all my favorite people on the internet, and you always go above and beyond.  

I am currently working with a group of 2nd graders once a week during an afterschool program.  We are working on a project to create a book about animals, in which each student will contribute a page.  Each student has chosen an animal, examined a picture of it, and generated questions about that animal.  They have made some predictions about their questions, and are now seeking answers.  We have discussed several ways students can research the answers to their questions.  One resource that isn’t often talked about is asking an expert.  This is where you come in, AskScience!


Our 2nd graders are very eager to learn and are excited about getting to ask scientists about the animals they have chosen.  Some questions are more in-depth than others; as an expert, perhaps you might be able to supply them with some additional information, fun facts, or prompts that might lead them into asking deeper questions.  On my end, I will be walking around monitoring responses, helping students to understand and respond to the answers, and generate new questions.   When this is over, the students will be writing a few sentences about their animal, will find or draw some pictures, and will compose a page that will go into the final, published book.

Please remember that these students are about 7 and 8 years old, so choosing appropriate language is important!  I have absolute faith in the AskScience community.  (I would ask if anyone has a potentially offensive/inappropriate username, they post on a throwaway. )  The students will post on a shared account: ""2ndGrader"".  I will be posting on my own account.  Hopefully everything will go smoothly!

Again, thank you so much for being a wonderful community, and thank you to the individuals who are taking the time to respond to the children.  If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me!

My questions are those in the title, I'll develop them the best I can. So theorically, let's imagine we have some deep sea fishes in our possession. Could they survive in an aquarium ? First, in a classic one with no specifities (just a basic tank full of sea water) ? And second, maybe in a special one, with everything they could need (pressure, special nutriments...) ?

I guess this brings another question such as ""Do they need this high pressure to live ?"" and another ""Could we recreate their natural environment ?""

The previous questions supposed that we had such fishes in our possession, so the next question is ""Is it possible to catch one ? And after catching it, taking it up ?"". Obviously not with a fishing rod, but maybe with a special submarine and a big net... (this sounds a bit silly)...


And then, if we can catch some, imagine we have a male and a female, could they breed ?  


I really don't know much about fishes so sorry if I said some stupid stuff...

**EDIT:**

Thanks for all the replies!  I am still catching up, reading them.

A summary (shoot me a PM if I've erred in this!):

It has been pointed out many times that ""Psychopathy"" and ""Sociopathy"" tend to be used interchangably, while ""Anti-Social Personality Disorder"" is considered to be quite different, based on behaviour rather than personality.  I think I recall reading that the DSM only focuses on ASPD.

There seems to be some disagreement on the subject of whether Psychopathy is inborn or not, and relatedly, whether it is something a person can be ""a little bit of"".  I had always thought it stemmed from a structural difference in the brain.  I haven't read anything so far which would suggest this.  I have asked /r/askscience if it was heritable before, but received no consensus.  (ASPD, however, seems to be at least partially, if not fully, based on learned behaviour.)

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the general consensus tends to be that psychopaths may recognize that they are different than others, but few of the estimated 1% of people who are thought to be psychopathic would go out of their way to actually get themselves diagnosed.  Typically such a diagnosis is not important except in the case of delinquency, which blurs the line between psychopathy and ASPD, as explained above.",Does the average psychopath know they are a psychopath?,2325
Rullknufs,407,751,1der30,1314,"Me and a fellow classmate started discussing this during a high school physics lesson.

A photon is emitted from an atom that is not moving. The photon moves away from the atom with the speed of light. But since the atom is not moving and the photon is, doesn't that mean the photon must accelerate from 0 to the speed of light? But if I remember correctly, photons always move at the speed of light so the means they can't accelerate from 0 to the speed of light. And if they do accelerate, how long does it take for them to reach the speed of light?

Sorry if my description is a little diffuse. English isn't my first language so I don't know how to describe it really.","When a photon is emitted from an stationary atom, does it accelerate from 0 to the speed of light?",2065

niklaskronwalled,226,1492,sy43v,1305,"Kind of a strange question, I'm not sure if it makes sense, but I'll do my best to explain...

I know that, theoretically, if an observer were to exist in time and space right outside the event horizon of a black hole, and they were there for a year, for example, this year to them would actually be several years to an observer here on earth.  When an observer is close to a lot of matter, or when it is moving at very high speeds (or both), time moves more slowly than it otherwise would.

Also, as I understand it, we believe that the Big Bang happened 15 Billion years ago because we see the speed with which the Universe is expanding, and we can calculate that it must have been expanding for 15 billion years from a central point.  I'm not exactly sure how they calculate the ""age"" of the Universe, but I think this is the 'jist' of it.

With these things in mind, is it possible that the *actual* age of the Universe is far greater (possibly infinitely) than the 15 billion year consensus?  I imagine the first couple nano-seconds of the Big Bang, and I know that there is a great deal of mass moving with tremendous velocity.  Is it possible that time has a telescoping effect as we move further back in time, closer and closer to the moment of ""origin""?  That what we currently calculate as the first ""second"" of the Universe actually lasted millions of years **in those moments** due to the seemingly elastic nature of time?

**Edit - [NJerseyGuy seems to have the most popular answer so far](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/sy43v/time_slows_down_near_large_mass_and_at_high/c4hz0wp), and his answer is ""No"".

So whether it's regarding how volcanoes form, why there are different types, what the impacts of super-eruptions might be, or wondering what the biggest hazards are, now's your opportunity!

About me: Most of my work is concerned with the shape of deposits from various types of flow - for example, why particular grading patterns occur, or why and how certain shapes of deposit form in certain locations, as this lets us understand how the flows themselves behave. I am currently working on the first experiments into how sustained high gas pressures in these flows effect their runout distance and deposition (which is really important for understanding volcanic hazards for hundreds of millions of people living on the slopes of active volcanoes), but I've also done fieldwork on numerous volcanoes around the world.

I read an article about the possibility of reviving the extinct Passenger Pigeon:
http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/03/passenger-pigeon-de-extinction/
to keep it short, migrating birds migrate, which means when it gets cold they go south and are back when it's not cold anymore. I don't know much about bird evolution but I guess this is something a species learns to do over a lot of generations.
so I was thinking: if they get this pigeon back from the deads, will the first generation of born-again species know where to go and when? for dna-engraved instinct stuff or something like that.

Hey AskScience,

I'm a fluoride salt chemist/engineer and I'll be fielding your questions about molten salts for as long as I can today.  I've included some background which will allow you to get up to speed and start asking some questions--its not required but encouraged.

**My credentials:**

- I've designed, built, and operated the largest fluoride salt production facility in the United States (potentially in the world right now).  Its capable of making 52kg batches of[ Flibe salt \(2LiF-BeF2\)](http://imgur.com/a/UM2fz) through purification with hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen gas at 600C.  I've also repurified salt from the MSRE Secondary Coolant Loop.

-I've run corrosion tests with lesser salts, such as Flinak and KF-ZrF4.

**Background and History of Molten Salt Reactors:**

A salt is simply a compound formed through the neutralization of an acid and base.  There are many industrial salt types such as chloride (EX: NaCl), Nitrate (EX: NaNO3), and fluoride (EX: BeF2).  Salts tend to melt, rather than decompose, at high temperatures, making them excellent high temperature fluids.  Additionally, many of them have better thermal properties than water.  

Individual salts usually have very high melting points, so we mix multiple salt types together to make a lower melting point salt for example:

LiF -  848C

BeF2 - 555C

~50% LiF  50% BeF2 - 365C.

Lower melting points makes in harder to freeze in a pipe.  We'd like a salt that has high boiling, or decomposition temperatures, with low melting points.

A molten salt reactor is simply a reactor which uses molten salt as a coolant, and sometimes a fuel solvent.  In Oak Ridge Tennessee from the fifties to the seventies there was a program designed to first: [power a plane by a nuclear reactor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Nuclear_Propulsion) , followed by a civilian nuclear reactor, [the molten salt reactor experiment (MSRE)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment).

To power a jet engine on an airplane using heat only, the reactor would have to operate at 870C.  There was no fuel at this time (1950's) which could withstand such high heat, and therefore they decided to dissolve the fuel in some substance.  It was found the fluoride based salts would dissolve fuel in required amounts, operate at the temperatures needed, could be formulated to be neutron transparent, and had low vapor pressures.  The MSRE was always in ""melt down"".

Of course, you might realize that flying a nuclear reactor on a plane is ludicrous.  Upon the development of the [ICBM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile), the US airforce wised up and canceled the program.  However, [Alvin Weinberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Weinberg), decided to move the project toward civilian nuclear power.  Alvin is a great man who was interested in [producing power so cheaply that power-hungry tasks, such as water desalination and fertilizer production, would be accessible for everyone in the world](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reflections-big-science).  He is the coined the terms ""Faustian Bargain"" and ""Big Science"".  Watch him talk about all of this and more [here](http://www.osti.gov/coroh_video/media/Alvin_Weinberg).

**Triumphs of the MSRE:**

- Ran at 8 MW thermal for extended periods of time.

- First reactor to use U233 fuel, the fuel produced by a thorium reactor.

- Produced a [red hot heat](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/MSRE_Heat_Exchanger.JPG).  In the case of all heat engines, [Hotter reactor = More Efficiency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_efficiency#Carnot_efficiency)

- Online refueling and fission product removal.

- 15,000 hours of operation with no major errors.

- Potentially could be used for breeding.

helloalicehello,292,720,1je0lv,1182,"So there's a box fan. Which will most efficiently move out warm air and move in cool air? Having the fan at the top of the doorway, pointing out and naturally sucking cold air into the room, or having the fan on the floor, blowing cold air in and forcing warmer air out?

I have the fan facing out. My thinking is that if the fan is facing in, since the cold air is the strong current and low to the ground (roughly 1/4 door height is air going in, 3/4 is pushed out), it may end up pushing out some of the colder, leaving the hot air at the top fairly untouched. By putting the fan facing out, it's forcing the warmer air into the air conditioned room. IDK, it makes sense to me but I guess I can't articulate it.

EDIT: Okay, so the general consensus is that nails a basically composed of keratin. Apparently there is a layer of some sort of nail matrix in between the epidermis and the actual nail. This material is what actually moves but  is so miniscule that it doesn't hurt and is not noticeable.

Another argument is that the skin under our nail is pulled off by our nail so slowly that the pain receptors are not set off and we feel nothing. This is also what people on this thread think is true with hairs, the process is so slow that our body either can't or chooses not to set off pain receptors; otherwise we'd be in constant pain.

Abusing,724,1795,p6csa,1092,"Hi Reddit! There's a few questions that I haven't been able to piece together answers for in my head on the subject of evolution. I'll start with what my brain is working with.

Evolution as I understand it: Any favorable mutation, whether small or large, to an organism will tend to tip the scales of survival in it's favor  against its competition in its environment. This increases its likelihood of surviving and reproducing. This mutation is likely to carry on to future generations. This process is continuously ongoing and is easily observed over large lengths of time.

I hope that's right. My English is decent, but I can't really articulate my questions in an elegant way. I'll use an example for each of my questions to try to make them a bit more clear. Feel free to crush my assumptions and mistakes, but try to focus on the idea behind the example, more than the specifics of the example itself.

1) Development of new genus

How do minor, random mutations cause such specific long term changes in any organism. Example. Let's take fish who makes the eventual transition into a land based creature. This fish would have to randomly acquire the ability to absorb oxygen from the air, develop limbs to move on land, change its ""skin"" to survive in air and compete against an entire new world of predators. All of these changes would also have to be favorable to the organism as well. My brain tells me the likelihood of this happening, no matter the length of time, is so remote it seems negligible. 

2) Adaptation vs Evolution

Why do various different species, develop similar traits, in a common environment as opposed to a great variety of adaptations to the same environment. Example: Why would the loss/diminishment of a sense to a large group of organisms be a favorable change to all these organisms. i.e; Troglobites. Almost universally blind, but their ancestors are all creatures which had the ability to see. Why/How did this trait (blindness) become favored, almost universally, over competing organisms who could see?

2.5) Adaptation vs Lamarckism

On the same thought as question 2. Has Lamarckism been proven false in long term scenarios. I understand use and disuse in a few generations not being observed, but how about over thousands of generations? Millions? Would a colony of rats, living in a scentless environment (theoretically) over a large amount of generations lose their sense of smell? Would this be because of disuse or natural selection?

3) Can humans keep evolving? 

With our massive gene pool, lack of competition and the ability to change our environment to suit us, instead of the other way around. Will our evolution continue? Is it possible we regress as a species? Traits that would not be favorable in a competitive environment are accepted and passed on to future generations in this current day.

Assume that the rooms are sealed and are in the shape of a cube. Since the light bulb can absorb the light too, assume it disappears instantly after it's turned off.

1) How about non-black/white colors. Would the times be different between a red and yellow room?

A little background info to prevent confusion:

* I live in Minnesota, not near any large bodies of water

* This picture was taken an a sunny 75 degree day

* I'm assuming that it is a metal fence with some kind of rubber/plastic coating(do not know for sure)

* and the fence is probably well over 10 years old



So r/askscience, what causes this to happen? And what makes them go in such designs? I'd really love to know.

EDIT: Another side note, on some parts you can peel it off, and it sort o reminds me of something like dried wood glue or something. Could it possibly be some sort of resin from when they put the coating on or glued the coating onto the fence?

**EDIT:**
**Answering some frequently asked questions**

* No, it isn't from the pine needles. Well, it may be in that certain section, but also occurs on parts of the fence that aren't even near any plants I'll upload pictures of different parts of the fence that aren't near any plants at all when i get the chance

* No, the fence is not anywhere near an: open pit mine, large body of water, stone working company, cement company, plaster casting, metal blasting, salt storage, busy road, farm etc I live in a normal suburban neighbourhood.

* We don't have a sprinkler system, basically the only time the fence gets wet is from the rain

* Also just thought I'd say that the residue type stuff has been there for a long time, it hasn't just recently occured

Additional questions that others have asked:

To make it simpler - Any weight of flashlight and luminosity can be used, but I'd rather not have some kind of super light flashlight with ultra-luminosity. Just a flashlight that you can pull off of a shelf in a store.

I read about it somewhere that no matter how heavy a spacecraft is, if there is no outside influence heavier than a flashlight, then pointing a flashlight out the ass end will eventually cause acceleration, even if it's millenia from now.

I will post each question as a separate comment, followed by the student's initials.

School today is from 8:00 AM to 2:15 PM EST.

If anyone is interested in Skyping in to the class to answer a few questions, please let me know!

Just a few guidelines, please:

- Please try to avoid swearing.  I know this is reddit, but this is a school environment for them!

* Please try to explain in your simplest terms possible!  English is not the first language for all the students, so keep that in mind.

* If questions are of a sensitive nature, please try to avoid phrasing things in a way that could be offensive.  There are students from many different religious and cultural backgrounds.  Let's avoid the science vs religion debate, even if the questions hint at it.

* Other than that, have fun!

These students are very excited at the opportunity to ask questions of real, live scientists!

Hopefully we can get a few questions answered today.  We will be looking at some responses today, and hopefully more responses tomorrow.

I hope you're looking forward to this as much as I and the class are!

Thank you again for being so open to this!

But, is it a symbiotic relationship?

THANK YOU so much for all of your responses!  We are going to have such a great 6th period today.  I'm just blown away that so many people took the time to respond, and I can't wait to share your information with my class.  I also think the students are going to be really proud and amazed that experts took their questions seriously and took the time to respond (I'm anticipating a much fuller parking lot next week!).  I was only expecting people to tackle the title question; my expectations have been blown out of the water! 

I also love all the videos posted (especially the lava + ice, lava + garbage, and thermite + liquid nitrogen), and I'll definitely be sharing them.  

I just woke up after staying until 9:45 PM last night for back to school night; I'm sorry it's taken me so long to respond.   I'll take time during my planning period to read each response more carefully and prepare to blow my sixth periods' minds!

We are the authors, Peter Ralph (/u/petrelharp) and Graham Coop
(/u/grahamcoop), of a recent paper on
[The Geography of Recent Genetic Ancestry across Europe](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001555).

The article made some news in
[a](http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-european-dna-20130508,0,6298389.story)

[places](http://www.nature.com/news/most-europeans-share-recent-ancestors-1.12950)
with the headline that ""Europeans are all related"".  What does that
mean? Didn't we already know that?  And how can you show that the
Spanish and the Polish have the same ancestors only 1,000 years ago,
but also see different effects of events from 1,500 years ago in their
genomes?  We're ready to talk about genetics, genealogy, and even a
little bit of European history (Although note that we're not historians).

Here's a quick intro; there's more detail [here](http://gcbias.org/european-genealogy-faq/).

Few of us know our family histories more than a few generations back. It is therefore
easy to overlook the fact that we are all distant cousins, related to
one another via a vast network of relationships. 

In the paper we use
genome-wide data from European individuals to investigate these
relationships over the past 3,000 years, by looking for long stretches
of genome that are shared between pairs of individuals through their
inheritance from common genetic ancestors. We find evidence of
ubiquitous recent common ancestry, showing for instance that even
pairs of individuals from opposite ends of Europe share hundreds of
genetic common ancestors over this time period. 

Since the vast
majority of genealogical ancestors from 1,000 years ago are not
genetic ancestors, this implies that all of the Europeans in our
sample share nearly all of their genealogical ancestors only 1000
years ago (albeit to differing extents). Despite this degree of
commonality, there are also regional differences. Southeastern
Europeans, for example, share relatively more common ancestors that
date roughly to the era of the Slavic and Hunnic expansions around
1,500 years ago, while most common genetic ancestors that Italians
share with other populations lived longer than 2,500 years ago. The study of long stretches of shared genetic material promises to uncover
rich information about many aspects of recent population history.

I have spent over a year and thousands of dollars. I am trying to make a small business, though now it is just a hobby because of this issue. 

I have a furnace that can reach 2100F or 1150C as a working temperature. I have kept the glass at that temperature for 12 hours, and there were bubbles everywhere. 

If I get the advice I need I will make something using this kiln, and ship it to them for free---&gt; and it is up to you what you want me to make. 

I have no clue why this doesn't work!!! annealing is no problem, but the bubbles are.

Should I use a vacuum furnace? If so, I ""can"" buy one, as I know it will be cost prohibitive in the long run to ""rent""/oem this stuff. I am just curious if the vacuum will still have these bubbles in the glass. Also, what temperature does it need to be at and how long? or really if a vacuum furnace WOULD work?

I spent a lot of money on this. I first built 2 furnaces, they were a disaster, then i bought another one that can reach those temperatures 2100F and 1150C, was crazy expensive, but my still work for the 2nd process if the vacuum furnace works. 

Please help!

Edit: should also add that I do not use large pieces, rather small pieces, the warmglass website about stacking would not work

Edit 2: not sure why i got a downvote, but from what i know askscience should be downvoted if it is not a scientific question. this is not ask google (which i googled for months), but a hardcore brain scratching question.
 thanks

Edit 3: I am absolutely amazed at how wonderful reddit is. I probably saved a year, minimum, by spending a few hours here.

As a high school science teacher I have to deal with misconceptions on many levels.

If one object lies within another's gravitational field, they will move towards eachother, right? But of course, for any object to move, it requires energy. And that energy has to come from somewhere. But where does it come from in this case?

To use the real-life example that made me wonder this. There's a clock in my lounge room which is one of those old-fashioned style one that uses weights. As the weight is pulled down to the earth by gravity, it moves the gears in the clock to make the clockwork operate. Every now and then you have to reset the weight when it gets to the bottom of the chain. But aside from that, it just seems like you're pulling energy to power the clock out of nowhere.

This feels like something that should have an easy enough answer that I ought to know, but I can't figure it out. Can someone explain this to me?

Does the historical record provide support to his hypothesis that fasting makes people more famine resistant?

There are some societies where fasting people live as neighbors with non-fasters in similar socioeconomic circumstances.  Has there ever been a point in history when a famine struck and the fasting group was shown to have been more famine resistant than the non-fasting group?

I don't have a strict definition for famine resistance so feel free to form your own reasonable definition.

rohanman,131,410,100to0,806,"I struggled in college with higher math. However, I made it through. Today I work in engineering and still struggle. I figure I am probably not alone with my challenges. I read a lot of technical papers and find that many writers tend to ""write with math"". This is horrifying to me every time I turn the page to see no words - just endless equations. Usually following these equations is a declaration of ""...in conclusion, you can clearly see that..."". I also hate it when authors neglet to define variables. 

My question is, what is your process for reading these equations? I tend to look for familiar similar equations and get the context but that is about all I do before getting bored and moving on. Please help me get better at reading math. Was there a course that you took that taught these skills that I slept through?

EDIT:Wow…great suggestions. Thanks so much. Here are the most helpful comments: 
Take notes, decompose the equation, read it over slowly again and again…take your time. The equations are there for precision, words (prose) are there to introduce, conclude. Practice. Practice. Practice. Understand the variables. Run the equations with the variables at 0, infinity, etc to find out what happens.

For instance if I take a bar of aluminum and I pull on it (applying a tensile load) it will eventually yield if I pull hard enough meaning there's some permanent deformation in the bar. This means if I take the load off the bar its length is now different than before I pulled on it. 

If there are answers to some of these questions, I'm curious what they are:

* Does space experience stress and strain like conventional materials do? 

* Does it have a stiffness? Moreover, does space act like a spring, mass, damper, multiple, or none of the above?

* Can you yield space -- if there was a mass large enough (like a black hole) and it eventually dissolved, could the space have a permanent deformation like a signature that there used to be a huge mass here? 

* Can space shear?

* Can space buckle?

* Can you actually tear space? Science-fiction tells us yes, but what could that really mean? Does space have a failure stress beyond which a tear will occur?

* Is space modeled better as a solid, a fluid, or something else? As an engineer, we sort of just ignore its presence and then add in effects we're worried about.",Can space yield?,1250

AllThatJazz,94,500,13i551,790,"So, I'm under the impression that Earth got to keep it's atmosphere due to it's molten liquid iron core. 

This core generates a powerful magnetic ""shield"", that diverts much of the solar wind around, and away from our planet. 

Without it, I once heard that the solar wind would strike, and eliminate our atmosphere in a few million years, give or take. 

Mars, for example, has no molten iron core, and a fleetingly thin atmosphere. So Mars probably lost it's atmosphere and a lot of water, because it lacks a molten liquid iron core.

If this is true, how then does Saturn's moon Titan get to keep it's atmosphere? 

Is it because it is much further from the sun? 

Even if it's further away, I would have thought that there is still a significant and steady solar wind at Saturn, that would eventually strip away a smaller body's atmosphere?

The two theories are either A) it just happened that more matter was created than antimatter or B) Matter --&gt; antimatter vs matter--&gt; opposite but equal matter is not perfectly symmetrical (this is what my understand of CP violation, not sure if thats correct. Also is the symmetry that the spin and charge are not perfectly equal but opposite or is it that the actual masses expected are not what are observed ) and for some reason the equilibrium is slightly tilted in matter's favor. If this is the case, could it be that anti-nutrino's from neutrons becoming proton's, electrons and anti-nutrino's dont react with matter because they have no mass so that the expected discrepancy is actually just a whole bunch of anti-nutrino's that dont react with normal matter?

Antranik,139,508,1ms7ke,738,"Here is why I ask:

* Male olympian gymnasts that specialize in the still rings are no taller than 5'5"".

* The taller one is, the longer their limbs are which makes for a longer ""lever"" and therefore requires greater strength to overcome the leverage.

* In practice, not only do taller people have to have generate more strength to do the same moves, but their joints have to deal with *incredibly greater* loads.

* So the conditioning required for the connective tissue to get *even* stronger for a taller person is even greater.

* Some moves are so difficult for the taller folks, that it's not just a strength issue but also one of great pressure (and danger of pain/injury) on their joints.  For example, when one can hold an [Iron Cross](https://www.gymnasticbodies.com/forum/topic/3872-iron-cross-training/?p=41346), it *feels* as though their elbows are going to snap apart.  This can be disheartening to say the least.

**So I'm wondering, as one gets taller, do their joint capsules also grow proportionally larger?  Do they grow strong enough to deal with the significant loads that can be placed on them for gymnastics?**

Or conversely, as one gets shorter and short (think of a small child gymnast), are their joints massive relative to their limb-lengths compared to adults?

###ETA

* Great response.  Thank you /u/orthopod for your insight as an orthopedic surgeon.  He points out that the issue at hand in this situation may be ""cartilage sheer strength and crush strength.""

And of course, the issue is multi-faceted for sure, but I believe /u/paxprobellum is onto something as s/he suggested an answer to the following question would help us out as well:

* **Is the insertion length of X muscle non-linear with body size? (Or in other words, does the insertion length of a muscle grow proportionally with body size?) Can anybody answer that question?**

###ETA #2

/u/eshlow from /r/bodyweightfitness (my fave sub!) [elucidates](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1mtfje/can_anybody_answer_this_question_is_the_insertion/):

&gt;Depends like the ortho said. Larger people can have smaller joints, smaller people can have larger joints... so too insertion points vary.
&gt;For example, elite sprinters have an insertion of their achilles much closer to the fulcrum of the ankle because as the calf contracts it will rotate the foot faster.
&gt;For something like an iron cross an insertion point of the pec/lats further from the glenohumeral joint will make it easier while a closer insertion point makes it harder.

###ETA #3

If someone wants to visualize the pecs/lats anatomically (like I do)... it's like this:

**[Pectoralis Major](http://ittcs.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/img_03511.jpg)**

* Origin: Medial 1/2 of Clavicle, Sternum
* Insertion: Costal Cartilages to the Greater Tubercle of the Humerus

**[Latissimus Dorsi](http://thebalanceguru.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/latissimus-dorsi.jpg)**

* Origin: All lumbar vert., sacrum, coccyx and posterior iliac crest
* Insertion: intertubercular sulcus of the humerus

(Reminder of origin vs insertion: The origin is the attachment that doesn't move.  The insertion is the movable bone.  Body movement occurs when muscles contract across joints and *their insertion moves towards their origin.*)

* [I FOUND THIS ON GOOGLE BOOKS (PAGES 14 &amp; 15)](http://books.google.com/books?id=IQ1zKgeDBj8C&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;ots=Cn2cebs521&amp;dq=insertion%20point%20leverage%20muscle&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) that has beautiful drawings (and explanations) about how/why the insertion point being further away from the joint allows one to have more strength even if their bones are the same size!)

I'm trying to understand the significance of IQ testing for children and teenagers. Is a 13-year-old with an IQ of 150 likely to mature into an adult with an IQ of 150? 

I guess what I'm really asking is whether IQ curves for children as compared against peers looks different than the IQ curves of adults as compared against their peers. Unless I fundamentally misunderstand IQ, the mean is 100 for both groups. But is the standard deviation larger or smaller for children as compared to adults?

Edit: Just to be clear, my question is not about ""overall intelligence"" or ""academic standing.""

I've always been told that people can go 2 to 3 weeks without food, but usually, that was in the context of surviving in the woods, where one likely wouldn't be receiving the necessary amount of vitamins.

Also, what all would start happening to our bodies? And would there be any differences between longevity of males and females? ","If a Normal Person with a Healthy Weight Started Consuming Only Water and Vitamins, How Long Could They Survive?",1326

1) If you weren't able speak for a few weeks/months, would you have trouble using your tongue to form certain sounds in order to talk? 

2) In addition to your tongue, would your vocal chords be unable to produce sound and/or would you have to re-learn how to use them? 

3) Would any other muscles be affected by lack of use?

4) Lastly, if your ability to speak was affected, how long would it take to re-learn how to use the muscles involved with speech?

Also, is nuclear energy obtained from heat energy being released from unstable particles? Is this an example of matter turning into energy?

EDIT: Ok, wow... people got opinions. It seems like the consensus is somewhere between ""No such thing as a bad question"" and ""Do you research before you ask."" Obviously it's a fine line. I tend to think that OPs should at least check to make sure their question isn't answered in the first paragraph of the wikipedia article, but half the fun of askscience is that you can get a hold of a real live expert who's nice and patient enough to answer.
