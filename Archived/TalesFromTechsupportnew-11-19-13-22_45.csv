lawtechie,1,1,1r15nt,6,"This isn't a story about how useless and annoying users can be. It's a story about how vendors can ship pre-broken products and let us figure out how to support them. 

It's 2000. My company has about six buildings on two blocks in a city. The powers that be think a wireless network will be cool. I've volunteered to select a vendor and make sure the whole thing works. I pick a few vendors and realize that only one will support all the platforms we use in a relatively secure manner. 

For some unknown reason, this particular hardware manufacturer uses one device for access control and another as the wireless/wired bridge/access point. 
The access controllers have a bunch of  ethernet ports to the access points and one uplink port to connect them to the rest of the wired network.
We configure the wired network to tunnel traffic  between the three access controllers and the ten access points. The uplink ports are routed to a virtual local area network that can connect to the rest of our wired network.

This mess works with our preliminary testing on both Macs and PCs. We start issuing wireless cards to end users with laptops. We're using the best security we can get- 128 bit WEP and MAC address whitelisting. 

Everybody's happy for two days. Then all of a sudden, cards can't authenticate. It doesn't seem to be a driver or OS issue, since Macs or PCs won't connect with onboard or vendor cards. 

The vendor goes from being really happy that we're doing such a large rollout to dead quiet. Turns out they're unfamiliar with more than one access controller on a network. 

For speculation's sake, I reboot the access controller. All the clients within range of the connected access points handshake and connect. 

I contact the vendor again and they claim they'll do some fixes in the next firmware update, whenever that is.

I run down to the local hardware store and buy a few lamp timers. I run extension cords from the UPS to the lamp timer and connect the access controllers' power to the lamp timer. I then set the lamp timer to turn the controllers off at 3:30 AM and turn them back on at 3:45AM. 

I then electrical tape everything together to make sure that nothing inadvertently falls apart. I tell my boss what I've done so he doesn't freak out about this horrible kludge. 

Two months later, the manufacturer ships a firmware update that doesn't fix the problem. For all I know, the lamp timers are still taped to the network racks...","I'll fix the wireless network. I just need three lamp timers, two extension cords and some electrical tape...",7
Gambatte,5,3,1r0tjr,18,"*Slightly after* the dark days of pre-history, when the primordial ooze was still belching forth the first progenitors of what would one day become mankind, I was but a lowly pimply faced supervisor of a small team of even pimplier faced youths, in a company where many of these teams existed.

I was - and still am - great friends with another such supervisor (who I'll refer to as SS, for SuperSupervisor), and we would often share the day to day gripes that would arise. This is one of his stories.

He had the great joy of supporting the systems that fed a certain CRT display. This display was used more or less constantly, day and night. The place that the display was installed also had large windows, which the users would be looking through to visually confirm the information on the display.

At about 5 a.m. a user reported that the display had suddenly stopped working! Completely blank! A PFY was roused from his slumber and dispatched to investigate this priority fault, as was procedure. Then the second PFY was called in, too. Finally, SS got the call.

SS is a great guy. Seriously. But he has had problems with insomnia, so if he's actually managing to get some sleep, you leave him sleeping, or pay the price.

SS arrives on site to find both PFYs standing just inside the door, nowhere near the supposedly faulty display. Due to the nature of this particular system, the user group is actually placed significantly higher up the management chart than tech support, and boy, do some of those users know it... and it just so happened that today's fault reporting user was one of those.

&gt; SS (to PFYs): WTF is going on?

&gt; USER: It's about time you got here!

&gt; SS: Why are my PFYs standing way over here, and not fault finding the equipment?

&gt; USER: I'm not letting your know-nothing apprentices hack at this, I need this back online *now*.

&gt; SS: So you've gone through the procedure to report the fault, but you won't let anyone other than me actually work on it?

&gt; USER: I need this up now, and you're the only one with the experience and know-how to get it working again quickly!

&gt; SS: How do you think I got that? From just standing on the far side of the room and wishing for it to get fixed?

&gt; USER: Just fix it. I'll be talking to your supervisor about your attitude later.

SS crosses the room, uses only a single finger to touch the display, and suddenly - it's working again!

&gt; USER: What? How...

SS storms out of the room with his PFYs in tow, to place his own complaint about someone's attitude.

The one finger fault fix? Well, because the users are looking out of the glass windows into the darkness at night, any light sources in the room will cause a reflection on the glass, obscuring their vision. So policy was that during hours of darkness, all light sources - including displays - were to have their brightness reduced to the minimum possible while still retaining visibility.

The sun had started to come up at 5 a.m. The increased ambient light level meant that what had been a usable display brightness in the darkness of night was now not bright enough to see anything on the screen. The user had just assumed the display was broken, eventually rousing the whole team before letting anyone attempt any actual fault finding, when either of the PFYs could have fixed it in seconds.

As this was a common occurrence (last I checked, the sun comes up *every* morning), across the top of the display were the words: **CHECK BRIGHTNESS LEVEL BEFORE REPORTING FAULTS ON THIS DISPLAY!**

*****

Addendum: The user was reprimanded for their attitude towards the tech support team, particularly the PFYs. Especially bad news was that this particular user had actually been a fairly highly placed technical manager in the past before entering the user group, and was later removed from the user group (I suspect the given reason for her removal was a thinly veiled excuse for her continued incompetence) and returned to a technical project management role (which she was equally bad at, although *that* is a story for another day).

SS's supervisor received the complaint about his attitude. He promptly binned it with the line:

&gt; I don't expect you to respect someone who can't follow instructions that are literally right in front of their face. If she starts giving you trouble again, give me a call, and I'll bring everyone - up to and including the Head of Tech Support - and she can explain herself to all of us.

ldma,1,1,1r0rhg,13,"I work for a major credit reference agency's business service support desk.  Every day, a parade of staff members from some of the best know banks, and insurance firms call me to install certificates or reset their passwords.

I don't expect bank staff to all be financial geniuses, but am constantly shocked how they are prepared to admit to an external company that they are ""not computer literate"" on being asked to open Internet Explorer, and locate the Tools menu.  The bank that I have an account with seems to be the worst offender for having staff like this.
  
This one bank's staff even tried to fraudulently get a userID off us after leaving things too late to get his own having an appointment that required one of our systems.

Zehnpae,8,5,1r05kc,30,"I think one of the most eye opening experiences a young technician can have is working as a field technician.  Going into businesses and people’s homes gives you an appreciation for just how varied the technical field really is.  You just can’t explain the feeling you get when you start out your work day fixing a server located in a pantry next to an old microwave and then end it showing someone how to safely download oddly specific pornography of semi-nude girls on exercise balls without getting a virus on their PC.

As with most careers though you eventually have that moment where you wonder, “Is this job really worth it?”

I’ve hinted at the story before and I may have posted it under a different username in the past but I got a few requests to tell it again so here goes.

I spent a few years as a house call PC repair tech. This was back in late 90’s, early-naughties (double-0’s?) when it was still a bit of an oddity.  These days you have a kid on every street offering to fix your computer in exchange for a hamburger.  Back then the only competition was Geek Squad and once people started figuring out we could fix their computer faster, cheaper and without them having to leave the house?  It was no contest.

My schedule got busy pretty quick. I would get asked for by name more often than not.  I had adventures, every day was an adventure.  I collected stories like pokemon.  Stories of delight, terror and everything between.  But the one thing that unifies all field technicians is that one story.  The one that haunts you in your waking dreams.

I pulled into the parking lot a little past one in the afternoon.  I’d worked that trailer park before.  It was mostly retirees with the occasional single dad.  This particular trailer had the mandatory 2 plastic lawn chairs, area carpet rug on top of the gravel and random assorted squirt guns.  Nothing out of the ordinary.

I checked my collar, knocked on the door and waited.  After a few moments your standard old lady, let’s call her Betsy, answered the door.  I introduced myself and Betsy exclaimed, ‘Oh you’re that geek guy! Come on in.’

I took a step inside the door, felt a crunch, took another step, felt another crunch.  Betsy closed the door and as my eyes adjusted from the brightness outside I looked down and I realized with a mental quiver just what I had walked on.

Kitty litter.

I glanced around and found that it was everywhere.  I couldn’t actually see the floor itself.  I was stunned into a moment of silence and sedation as I took it in.  My natural instinct was to turn and leave with a big ‘nope’ but I was too much the professional.  I asked her where the computer was.

Betsy smiled, either unnoticing or uncaring of my shattered perception of old people and began to lead me towards what I hoped wasn’t some sort of bizarre sex dungeon where she’d chop me up and then scoop away my bloody chunks along with more litter.  I remember noticing that the furniture was actually buried in the kitty litter, not settling on top of it.

She led me down a short corridor, *crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch*.  She led me into a small room with a desk buried a few inches deep in more litter, *crunch, crunch, crunch*.  Underneath the desk was an aging Gateway computer, a relic of a long gone era.  She offered no explanation, almost no awareness of it being there.  I didn’t have the wherewithal to ask.  I’ve seen some shit but I was channeling some epic level of stoicness to not start crying or begging for an explanation.

She gestured at the computer, explained that as of a few days ago it won’t turn on anymore.  I knelt down…yeah…I knelt down in the freaking cat litter to check the cabling and fiddle with the power button.  Standard PC repair operations, right?  I did have to dig the power strip out from about an inch of litter.  It was then I noticed the stuff was packed about 3 or 4 inches deep.

The power checked out, I could charge my phone.  I quickly swapped the power cable with a known good cable.  No dice.  No spin, nothing.  I then made my third big mistake of the day.

I opened the case up.

You know how when you pour kitty litter there’s that dust that flies into the air?  You know how computers tend to accumulate dust over time?  If it had been cocaine I’d be retired in the Bahamas right now with twin sisters making me waffles every morning.  What escaped was a powdery fury that pretty much explained why the PC had simply given up on life.  At that point there wasn’t much keeping me going either.

I explained, to my credit calmly and without wavering in my voice, that due to dust collection in the computer the machine had probably overheated or otherwise mechanically failed and it would cost more to have me fix it then it would to just upgrade the dinosaur of a PC she had.  I suggested she elevate the PC above her desk and clean it regularly should she purchase a new one.  I thanked her and then left.

It was until I was outside swearing to myself, wondering what the hell just happened that I realized I hadn’t seen a single cat.

pizzadudecook,12,4,1r04ca,41,"So I have never posted here before, so here we go.



I am a network admin/sys admin for a fairly large company. At headquarters we have three buildings. One for accounting and IT, one for administration and one for distribution. A little history, our distribution building has been hard to get dedicated internet access to due to its location. Instead we shoot a wireless signal over to it from the administration building to feed it internal access as well as internet. The setup has been working like a champ for a couple years without issue.



A couple weeks ago, the distribution building called, stating they were having issues accessing anything. So I go through the normal steps and check each piece of equipment in the line. They could all be reached from my desk except the AP in the admin building. After a little troubleshooting, I decide to get up and o look at the AP. Suddenly, they shout its working again and the situation is resolved.



This issue would come and go at random times for about a week. Finally when distribution called again, I dropped the phone and ran to the admin building. Now, everyone around here has the habit of turning off the lights and closing the door when they aren't in the office. So I speed down to the room this AP is located in and without thinking about knocking , I open the door because the lights are off.



As soon as I look up, sitting there is a very nice lady from marketing with her shirt wide open, and a breast pump on her chest. I quickly slam the door and run back to my office to try and figure out how to diffuse this. To this day I always knock on office doors, open or closed, even if the lights are off.







TL;DR: Always knock before entering",Pumping on the clock,45
Shadowlady,4,21,1r046v,88,"First of, I'm not sure if this is the right sub, as it's not your typical Tale from Tech support, it's more shocking than funny, but I need to share it! Also I wouldn't mind hearing if you guys experienced anything similar

Backstory, I do outsourced tier 2 IT support for a major gas company supporting many of their different locations world wide. 

Today a colleague asked me to take over one of his tickets because the user was a homeworker that went to the office specifically to have an issue resolved with his laptop that was not letting him log in, but my colleague did not have time to call him as he had was working on another urgent matter. 

Let's call the user Dave.
Dave had been chasing this already, calling repeatedly and stressing our level 1 out. I had somewhat of an idea what was going on and how to resolve it so I figured I would call Dave immediately, calm him down by letting him know I'm on it. That way I could also confirm the details I needed with him directly instead of picking through a week old ticket with 10+ updates to find all the relevant bits of information. 


That didn't work out to well because of course the main phone number given on the ticket was his home number and his office number was somewhere in the middle of one of the updates. So instead I caught Dave's wife, a lovely lady who informed me that Dave was in the office today because he was having issues with his laptop. I sheepishly apologized, explained that was why I was calling and that this was the number I had. She said she would check for his cell phone number but she just got a new cell phone so she was struggling to find it. In the mean time I found the update with another number on the ticket, so I thanked her for her help, told her that I would try the number and if by any chance it didn't work I would call her back. 

The number worked but Dave was not picking up. I left a Voice mail and went to work. Once an update he was missing was installing I focused on some other tickets and forgot about it. A couple hours later I checked and everything was completed successfully. I tried to call Dave again but still no answer. It was nearing the end of the work day and I didn't want Dave to be stuck in the office waiting for IT to do something, thinking his issue was not resolved yet. 

So I called Dave's wife to tell her that just in case he calls her, let him know he can go home, the issue is resolved. 

Then Dave's wife drops this on me: there has been a **major explosion** at the gas refinery Dave works at, 2 people were killed and another is missing. **She hasn't been able to reach Dave either.** I let out a huge gasp and all my colleagues are staring at me trying to figure out what we're speaking about. (They don't speak Dutch, so they can't understand)

Dave is not one of the people named missing or killed but not being able to reach him has clearly upset his wife. I'm completely stunned, I apologized for bothering her with something as trivial as computer difficulties right now and I check and tell her Dave should be fine as his office building is not anywhere close to the refinery. Thank god she then tells me Dave just texted that he has been in a meeting all day and that's why he didn't reply. 

The moment I hang up I get a message from first line: Dave is on the line and would like to speak to me. He just wants to know if his laptop is working.

BeardlessJesusSwag,15,9,1r03lx,64,"So, I work in my schools IT Department, and we have laptop carts with roughly 24 netbooks in each one. As I am going back to the Tech Office, this kid comes up to me in the hall and piles up 3 netbooks in my arms.

Today I had someone who blew my mind in terms of not listening and general twattery 

The guy has the obligatory rant at the beginning of the call, can't connect to wi-fi on this new phone, it's so inconvenient, I thought it was supposed to be easy, I paid a fortune for this and it doesn't work, *winge winge winge*

So we establish that the world has pretty much ended because he can't hook up to his wi-fi, and the guy starts talking to me as if I'm personally responsible. He starts demanding I send a replacement RIGHT NOW, I don't know if he expected me to just pull one out of my ass and teleport it over to him?

Anyway I manage to persuade him to troubleshoot, we restart the router and the phone, still nothing, reset the settings on the phone, still the same.

During all the above I continually asked him if he was SURE he had the correct wi-fi password, yes of course I do I CAN read you know?

36 minutes into the call and I tell the guy I'm going to need him to speak to the internet company as there is something wrong with the router, guy goes nuts with me, I ask him one more time to go and check the wi-fi password written on the router and make sure it is what he is putting in (must be like the 7th time I asked)

I have some backups but I end up doing most of the work for quality purposes. We have 2 separate SCCM2012 sites, one for our main office where half our employees are and one for Global. We currently have around 30 distribution points worldwide and are adding one or two almost every month. This just happened this morning on one of those, a new site in India that we are setting up. Indian Tech is a current employee and is the IT contact for one of our others sites in india. SiteTech is a new employee and is going to be the IT onsite. Indian Tech is there to set things up.

Naznac [9:15 AM]: is he going to be available during at least a part of the Head office hours at least for a few days, while we work out the issues and get everything up and running

Indian Tech [9:20 AM]: sure

Naznac [9:26 AM]: try again

Indian Tech [9:27 AM]: oki

Indian Tech [9:34 AM]: Naznac,i can see warning for Application Discovery

Indian Tech [10:18 AM]: deployment completed.

Naznac [10:19 AM]: ok now login with your OPR account and check if the AV is there, is it on the domain? have the proper admin account been added, is it in the proper timezone? are the regional settings good?

Indian Tech [10:19 AM]: oki

Indian Tech [10:27 AM]: yes all well. **Great!** my worry is only, how we can give user to install admin rights to install any software, if required

Naznac [10:28 AM]: users should not have admin rights by default. If they need to install software they have to ask the onsite tech

Indian Tech [10:29 AM]: mean opr?

Naznac [10:30 AM]: in this case the onsite tech would be SiteTech, so if a user needs to install a software they will need t ask him

Indian Tech [10:30 AM]: oki,please make SiteTech admin

Naznac [10:30 AM]: isn't there a **sitename** pc admin group in the admins?

Indian Tech [10:31 AM]: no,whts the exact name? Sitetech is not having any opraccount currently

Naznac [10:32 AM]: he will need to make a request for one

Indian Tech [10:32 AM]: sure

Naznac [10:32 AM]: **admin group name**

Indian Tech [10:33 AM]: no

Naznac [10:34 AM]: what is the pc name? i'll login to take a look

canhazadhd,5,5,1qzr1m,40,"First, a disclaimer. I do not work in tech support (gasp!). However, I've worked with computers for a number of years and am currently earning a degree in Computer Science. Onto the story!

As a Computer Science and Biology dual major, I'm required to take life science courses. This means interacting with professors who have almost no knowledge of computers. One of my non-CS professors is is one such person. Every day in lecture, his powerpoint is interrupted by a notification from Windows saying ""Quicktime Player has stopped responding. Would you like to end the process?"". Without fail, every single time that error comes up, he presses ""no"". Then, he's baffled as to why his computer is slow and almost unresponsive for the remainder of the lecture. One day, when the error came up, he asked if anyone knew anything about computers. I raised my hand and instructed him that, ""yes"", he did want to end the process. He clicks ""yes"" on the notification, and the rest of the lecture continues without a hitch.

Fast-forward one day, and the error comes up again. Can you guess which button was pressed? ""No""... ",Memorization is hard!,45
Jn108,11,5,1qzlsc,41,"Howdy folks! I've been reading this sub for a while and I finally have a story to share.

A little background on me. I am the manager of a small electronics store, we are a smaller chain that consists of 3 stores. I would not consider myself an expert exactly, but I can solve most basic-advanced problems. I build my own pcs at home and troubleshoot most of my own issues.

This story starts a little way back so stick with me. An older gentleman walked in with his laptop. Now this thing was old, and I mean that. He told us it was around 20 years old, I don't think it was that bad but the base of the laptop was about 1.5'' alone and it was running XP. He was looking to get an updated machine, no problem that's what I'm here for. So we look at the available machines and we find one of our low-mid range machines that would be a perfect fit for him. He requests a data transfer, so I write it up and turn him over to the techs so they can see exactly what he wants to transfer. 

Well his computer contained the following:
1. A folder called ""Things i don't use""
2. 3 pictures in his My Documents
3. 1, I repeat 1 email in his outlook inbox.
4.About 100 contacts in outlook.

So we get the contacts and 3 pictures transferred for him. We also made sure he had the right drivers for his printer installed and that it was working. We call him to inform him his new machine is configured and ready for him. 

Well today he showed up with his wife to pick it up. They came in carrying ANOTHER laptop and printer. He went on back to talk with the techs and his wife asked me if I could figure out for her why her printer wasn't working. Now here are the important details to remember here for this part of the story. The printer was connected to the laptop via USB with cable that were labeled with things like ""printer left"", referring to the left port on the back of the printer. She did not have the power cable with it.

With that in mind, on with the story. So I open up the laptop and get it started. My first thought was to get power to this printer so that I could test it if I did get it working. I asked about the power cord, ""do you happen to have the power cable with you?""

She stared at me blankly for a moment, then dropped this:

""Ummm, I'm not sure. Its wireless?""

""Ok, but I still need power""

""Oh, well i have some other cables I grabbed out in the car, maybe I have it there.""

Awesome, maybe I'll get lucky here. Sure enough, she returns with a bag containing the power cable. Now she has me wondering if she has been thinking it didn't need power, but upon grabbing the power cable I see there is also a label on the end of this cable so at least she HAS used it in the past. So now we have the printer on, and it's hooked up to the laptop but no go.

My next thought was to check the usb plug. So I give it a little tug to make sure it's well connected and I finally found the problem. The usb popped right out...usb plugs are usually connected more tightly than that. I look at the side of the laptop and find that the place it was connected was not at all a USB port, but rather the network plug. To quote the mythbusters ""Well there's your problem!""

Moved it to the USB and BAM! The computer recognized it and test page printed successfully. 

She looked at me like I was a wizard. She asked what she owed and she was shocked when I told her nothing.

But seriously...wireless power? We aren't that advanced yet.","""I don't know, it's wireless!""",46
elJEFFE89,27,17,1qzgqq,125,"Haven't posted anything in a while so I figured I'd share this story that shows that the more letters one has after their name the less common sense they possess. 

I work as a level 1 tech at a state university. 90% of my work is basically telling profs ""click yes"", plugging in cables, and installing/troubleshooting classroom technology. 

My day is running smoothly and is nearing is end when I get a call from possibly the derpiest professor that is employed here. She is calling for about the 20th time for audio not working in the room. Every time that I have gone out it has been that the audio cable was unplugged from the pc. So rather than walking all the way across campus, I decided to try to walk her through plugging in the cable over the phone. This is the conversation that ensued:

Me: ""OK, I think I know what the issue is. Are you currently in the room? ""

Her: ""yes I am.""

Me: ""Good. I would like you to look behind the computer and see if you can locate a wire with a green tip.""

Her: ""Oh there are so many wires back here. ""

Me: ""That's OK. We are just looking for the green tip in particular. Do you see it? ""

Her: ""Yes, I found it! ""

Me: ""excellent. Do you see a green circle in the back of the computer? ""

Her: ""yes""

Me: ""is the green tip in the green circle? ""

Her: ""no. ""

Me: ""can you put the green tip in the green circle? ""

Her: ""this is all too complicated. Can you send a tech?""

Me: ""yeah. I'll be there in a few""

FredFltStn,197,356,1qz6qm,1051,"About a year ago, the big company I work for dumped Blackberry and switched everyone over to iPhone 4s as their company phone. Since the Blackberry’s that we had previously carried were an older model with few features, most of the managers were happy with the switch.

Although the new phones were supposed to be used only for work activities, some of the people in the office went a little crazy, downloading apps and music onto the phone. The phones would sync calendars, email, and the like over the air, and didn’t need to be connected to a PC. 

Of course, many people used their desktop PC’s to charge their phone during the day, plugging the phone in while they were sitting at their desk. The iTunes app was preloaded on the desktops, and would pop up every time you plugged in the phone. No big deal, you just had to choose not to sync the phone and then close the app after it popped up.

One of the managers in my office was having an issue with a PowerPoint presentation, and asked me to help out. She’s not in I.T., and her computer skills are mediocre at best. I sat down at her desk, and went through the presentation with her, with me driving and her sitting by my side, walking me through what she wanted.

We came to a slide where she wanted to insert a photograph, so I clicked Insert/Picture from the menu.

Apparently, the manager had unknowingly downloaded all of the photos from her work iPhone to her desktop PC. More importantly, she had apparently been using the iPhone to take naked selfies, which were now gloriously displayed in extra-large icons across her 27” monitor. 

I closed the window as soon as I realized what I was looking at (ok, maybe a few seconds longer than that), and she immediately turned 10 shades of red. I blew it off like it was no big deal, saved the presentation, and told her we could work on it later. I walked back to my desk smiling from ear to ear.

AfroStorms,10,5,1qypme,39,"Okay, I do administration tech support for a large University. Some of our work involves going to the location and some is remote support. 

One faithful afternoon, while I am sitting at my desk, the phone rings. I see it is one of our older, less tech savvy users. I brace my self and answer. She is describing some issues with Outlook. So I ask if I can do a remote support session with her. Now it is no feat to initialize our remote support client. All you have to do is download and run the executable unique to the tech support's account. To get to this download, there is a shortcut which we place on all of our users desktop, and it is called remote support. No user can delete this without having admin rights, and if they do, it will load back on the next time they login. Now this poor old lady cannot find this link. So I ask if she can type the address in a Web browser. It is a long but easy address, but that is not the problem. She does not understand what I am asking. I explain how to enter a address into a URL bar. It is almost impossible not to be able to. She still cannot do it. She says she can Google things, so I tell her to Google our tech support name and the words remote support, knowing we are the first link in Google. She cannot do this either. At this point I have been on the phone for almost 15 minutes. Being as impatient as I am, I kindly tell her I will just come look at the computer in person. Hopping she didn't hear my head go through my desk. A simple 10 minute fix turns into a hour long fix.

""When it rains, it pours,"" I grumbled, sipping at a drip-brewed cup of Dark Magic and practically purring at the strength and taste.

Given the lack of concentrated caffeine in Keurig-brewed coffee, I'd prised open ten K-cups of Dark Magic to fill a double-filter of coffee, which I then brewed up. The weather in Austin had started to get cool again, after a weekend that was an all-too-unpleasant reminder of the ball-scorcher that was summer, and my helldesk was absolutely swamped with tickets. On top of everything, my second-newest PFY had injured himself and was on reduced duty, so it fell to me to get things done in his stead.

""Never send a PFY to do a network admin's job,"" I continued, sliding back into my chair and sitting on my feet, as is my wont, and my cell phone burst into Rick Astley's dulcet tones, signifying an incoming call. I arched an eyebrow - I hadn't expected the campus tech to call me, not when he had a PFY to unload troubleshooting on. A quick flick of the screen later, and my One's speakers blasted his voice out into the office.

""Hey, Jack, we've got a problem here,"" he said, frustration evident in his voice.

""Is it NEW_PFY?"" I took a sip. ""Because I just happen to have the financial aid office at TEXAS_COLLEGE in my contact list.""

I could tell his reply would be negative before he even said it. ""No, he didn't do anything. He _knows better_. I've got something new for you.""

He detailed the situation, leaving nothing out - apparently, a kid had driven his expensive SUV out to off-campus lunch at a very popular nearby restaurant, and in his brilliance, when he ran into the restaurant, he left his tablet and phone on the front seat, and the car unlocked.

The imbecile also left his keys in the cupholder.

...

You can guess where this is going.

...

Ten minutes later, when he came out with his order, his gadgets were gone, and so was his nice new car.

He got a lift back from a friend who had stopped there for lunch after he did, and the administration was in an uproar. I shrugged. A car stolen? Whoopdy-shit, that's why we have insurance, it'd be covered. The tablet? Not so much. A police report had already been filed, and we were asked to track the tablet and phone in order to recover them, and if it was at all possible, to try to save the car.

_It's the principle of the thing,_ I thought to myself, as I plugged the kid's credentials into iCloud and threw his phone into Lost Mode. A few clicks later, the police report number was registered with Computrace, and the tablet flagged as stolen. _Such useful tools... but only in the right hands._ I smirked. _Of course, it would be a TRAGEDY if this were to be misused._

About twenty minutes later, the device stopped moving (ReloadEvery is SUCH a nice tool), and after pouring another cup of Dark Magic, I took a look at the final location. Something seemed... off... about it. I grabbed the nearest cross-streets and plugged it into Google Maps, then switched to Satellite View. 

My eyebrows went up at what I saw, and I put down my coffee cup before laughing my ass off and grabbing my keys. I drained my coffee, then dialed a number on my cell on the way out the door. I had a drive to make.

- - - - -

**A SHORT WHILE LATER...**

- - - - - 

I walked into the school, phone (and bag of fast food - from a _rather popular nearby restaurant_) in hand, and strolled into the campus tech's office.

""What're you doing here?"" he asked. ""Didn't you track the phone and tablet?""

I nodded, and passed him my One with Google Maps pulled up to the approximate location of the phone, followed by the bag of food. His eyes widened.

""You've got to be joking.""

I shook my head and flipped the phone to Gallery, showing him a picture I took not twenty minutes before (not entirely coincidentally, taken outside a _rather popular nearby restaurant_), and he started chuckling.

""I pity him."" I could sense the laughter rising in him, and he stood up and locked his machine. ""The kid's in the office,"" he said, and walked out of his office, with me following. I threw a nod and a smirk to my newest PFY, who was sitting in the corner, stripping down machines for parts in his free period.

Sure enough, the kid was in the office, and his father was there too, as well as one Austin police officer with a notepad in hand.

""Did you find my phone?"" the kid said, jumping to his feet and looking at the campus tech frantically.

""Forget the phone,"" his father said. ""Where's the car?""

""I'm honestly surprised he doesn't know,"" I replied. ""Given what he did, he should know IMMEDIATELY where his phone and tablet - and yes, his car too - went.""

""What are you talking about?"" the dad said, his expression blanker than a new chalkboard.

""Does this look familiar?"" I said, turning my phone around to face the teenager and the father.

""I went to lunch there today; that's where my car got stolen,"" the kid retorted. ""So what?""

""Does THIS look familiar?"" I repeated, flipping to the next picture in the sequence, the one I'd shown the tech.

                            TOWING ENFORCED

    UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES WILL BE TOWED AT OWNER OR OPERATOR'S EXPENSE

His reply, much like his actions which kicked this off, was rather unwitty and lacking in common sense. ""I only parked there for, like, ten minutes!""

""And that's all they needed to take the car,"" I replied, flipping over to the phone's last location in Google Maps, which, when looked at via satellite view, was the towing company's storage lot. ""As of ten minutes ago, your phone was there, and I daresay you'll find the tablet and keys there too.""

His father glared at him.

The cop glared at him.

He glared at me.

I breathed on my fingernails, then buffed them on my button-down. ""So, phone found, tablet found, car found, universe saved, crisis averted. But just in case - next time, park in the appropriate areas.""

About 3 years ago, when those tornadoes went through the midwest, I had a customer, in that area, actually call complaining that her cable TV was out.  She lost internet also, and don't think she had our phone service (she did call from a cell phone, and don't remember details.).

But anyway, this was basically how the call went.

Customer:  Hey, my TV just went out, and so did the internet!  Am I in some kind of an outage again?!
Me:  I apologize for the inconvenience this may be causing you.  Can I have your phone number to look up your account information please?
Customer:  (Gives number).
Me:  From what I see here, you are indeed in an outage, as the tornado going through your area took out many important lines that run the infrastructure of your cable network.  This will affect TV, and internet.
Customer:  Don't use the weather as an excuse!  This is terrible service!  Send a tech out immediately now!
Me:  Ma'am, I can't do that.  For safety reasons, our technicians in your area are home with their family right now.
Customer:  WHAT!?  Fix it now!
------------------
At this point, I am face palming hard.  I'm thinking, how stubborn is this lady?  Apparently a lot!  It's no excuse to be yelling at me, and constantly going back to fix it now.  So I look at the weather map, and her address on it..  Damn, the tornado is nearly right there!
------------------
Me:  Ma'am, could you do me a favor?  Can you please look out your window please?
Customer:  *mumbles something but can't hear*  Ok.
Me:  Do you see the intense weather condition out there?
Customer:  Yes, the sky is very dark, it's raining very hard, and I know, there is a tornado around here.  (Though she didn't mention she saw it.)
Me:  Ok, would you drive in this condition?
Customer:  No!  I won't even go outside of the house!
Me:  Well this is why we aren't sending a technician out right now.  It is too dangerous, and we care about our techs safety.
Customer:  But, I need my TV and internet!
Me:  Sorry lady, there's nothing else I can help you with.  I can't schedule anything, not even for tomorrow, because we don't know what it will be like in the future days.  Please give us a call back when the weather is clearer, but I can guarantee you, the fact you are in a marked outage, your area will be fixed without needing a call back.
Customer:  So you're not going to help me?
Me:  *head meets desk*  I can't ma'am.

Gambatte,16,16,1qy5wl,88,"Earlier this year, a new ticketing system was implemented. Good times. The CEO was enamored of this cloud based system, and would not be dissuaded.

One of the first tickets he raised (in fact, the seventh ticket ever raised on the new system) was a fairly large change in the functionality of one of the data handling applications, which meant that in certain situations, some of the messages that were previously generated would instead be suppressed. The ticket was later enlarged to suppress a second group of messages; all of which was emailed to and approved by the CEO.

A few weeks after the change went live, the CEO suddenly charged up to my desk at great speed, wildly flinging excrement in all directions:

&gt; CEO: Holy crap! I just had [client] on the phone and they didn't get [first group message]! This is a major failure on our part! The company could be liable... We'd have to close the doors, fold the company if they get the lawyers involved.

&gt; ME: Um, okay. Isn't that exactly what you wanted to happen?

&gt; CEO: What? NO! That change was only to not send [second group of messages], not to stop [first group of messages].

&gt; ME: Hmmm... Let me look at the ticket. Nope, this is what you wrote: *{contents of ticket, specifically requesting suppression of first group of messages in this exact scenario, created with the CEO's user account}.* The suppression of [second group of messages] was added to the job later.

pyro-genesis,26,48,1qy4nn,287,"I used to be one of two onsite technicians at a combination college/animation studio/office block. This particular tale takes place a week before students are due to start arriving for the year.

The other tech (who we'll call B) and I were busy imaging a classroom full of computers for the incoming animation students. Various other teachers and staff members were working on different parts of the site, directing workmen and making last-minute changes. I was playing MP3s from the student server on the other side of the site where the students kept their files (some of them had good music and I had access to everything...) when the music suddenly stopped. At the exact same moment B said ""That's odd, I lost the connection to the mail server.""


10 seconds later all the PCs in the room started reported that they were unable to reach the image file that was on a different server, but happened to be in the same room as the mail and student server. The phone rang.

""It's *user* from the office. Everyone's internet stopped working.""


B and I exchanged glances. He raced for the door, I sauntered casually because I cared less than he did.


The server room was located in a closet at the back of the student library. When we got to the server room it was quiet. Too quiet. There was no power, and the UPS battery was utterly dead. I stuck my head into the library, where I spotted a guy wearing a fluorescent shirt and a tool belt filled with electrician-looking things.

Me: ""You didn't happen to turn the power off did you?""

Electrician: ""Yea, *college manager* wanted extra power outlets in here, so I had to rewire the breaker box. He told me no one was using the library until next week.""

Me: *facepalm* ""How soon do you think you can get it back on?""

Mr. T: IDK ABOUT THAT SHIT, YALL SOLD ME A MOTHERF*CKIN ROACH BOX (My manager hears this going down and comes over to help, about once a month people go fucking mental in gamestop so its kinda the norm.)

So my manager and I open the box, and it smells pretty rank. (Not to be confused with dank, wasn't that kind of roach-box)

I'm thinking to myself wtf happened in 1-2 weeks to make this thing smell like someone took a dump in the CD tray. The female employee working with us at the time (for only 3 days so far I might add) ran to bathroom to vomit and forgot that only the manager has the keys...yeah it was frantic rush, but I digress.

So I reluctantly remove the xbox from the packaging to test and inspect. 
As I am doing that my manager makes some progress with Mr. T

Mr. T: THERE ARE GOD DAMN COCKROACHES IN THE XBOX

Now I've heard of roaches in electronics, but never seen it in person, let alone 1-2 week old xbox 360. Ok so now the inquisitive biologist in me is intrigued. I check first to make sure its the same system sold on the recipet serial number. Check. Get gloves from the back room. Check. I checked the tamper sticker and it looked fine.

So I plug this smelly P.O.S. into our test unit, turn it on and right after the fan kicks in a fuckton of super small cockroaches pour out of the system vents in every direction. There other people in the store (minus the lady that left with her child after he cursed), so it was like 'Whack a mole' on the counter desperately trying to get the roaches back in the box or trash to seal up before customers see it. Honestly we didn't get them all. Now knowing what a roach box is, my manager looks at me and we both start to make each other laugh when we don't want to. 

Mr. T: See ya'll sold me a roach-box. 

Manager: Do you by chance have a problem with roa...

Mr. T: MOTHERF*CKER, ARE YOU SAYING I HAVE ROACHES IN MY HOUSE, MY HOUSE IS NEW, THERE AINT NO ROACHES.

I pretty much take the back seat on this one, I really don't have the authority to return a console that has been taken out of the packaging let alone with bugs in it.  My manager tries to explain to him the box was sealed, locked in our back room, and our store was the newest in the area. There were no roaches in the store....well before the xbox was brought back there wasn't at atleast.

So he's getting more and more pissed. It's getting to the point where we have told him to watch his language multiple times, and its borderline to where we call one of our cop friends that frequents the store or something. I ended up calling the district manager while the store manager tried to diffuse the situation...like everyone left the store at this point cause Mr. T was gonna explode at any second. I explain the situation to the district manager who says we can't take it back, I have to repeat myself again describing the loss of sales/customers he is causing. He told us directly to NOT call police and to deal with it. Before I could tell him that the employee in training vomited from the biohazard; he district manager started the customer is always right bullshit.

My manager couldn't afford to lose his job/career as he put years into getting a store.  I was about to quit and go to college full-time so I decided to just return the console under my name, still bad for my manager though but our best option without getting a swat team called in. It is basically a process where you sign that it is against company policy, etc. In the space where you say why; I wrote ""ROACH-BOX 360"" Boxed it up immediately and off to the refurb center it went. 

We made it clear to Mr. T that it was 'user error' and we fixed his fucking error. The customer is not always right. Get your house sprayed for bugs or don't live like a hoarder. 

I never got contacted about the ~$300 shrink. There are various reasons why they let it go, but thats a story on its own.

We replayed that on the surveillance video so many damn times, it was just clear enough to lip read the customer. Was worth the frustration with all the laughs from that. 

TL;DR  Roach-box 360. Enough said.

This is an email he sent to me a few weeks ago:

I come into work the following morning, and as I just sit down and about to login, he comes into my office and asks for my assistance.
I follow him into his domain, and the following occurs (We are using Google Apps):

* Fabio: So look here...Every time I get an email from managers it shows ""Me"" *Points to receiving recipient* 

* Me: Okay...

* Fabio: Oh hold on, see this one says me too! *Points to another email send by another person*

* Me: *Beings to explain the concept that google simplifies this as ""Me"" because it's yourself rather than your email*

* Fabio: *Butts in* Yeah but, can we change ""Me"" to have my name Fabio instead of ""Me""?

* Me: No. If (Jill/Bob) logs in, they see ""Me"" too because Google simplifies your email address with ""Me"", because it's being sent to you. 

* Fabio: So...You can't change it to Fabio?

* Me: No

* Fabio: Okay...Well no need then.

TL;DR: Fabio is bedazzled by the powers of ""Me"", turns to the wizards for guidance. Wizards are unable to aid his request and he gracefully waves his hair back and continues on with his adventures.  ",Me?,54
recon1991,2,8,1qxvn8,36,"Been following TFTS for a couple months now.  Love it all! First time posting here and not even sure this is all that funny.

**Background:**
I work as an IT Administrator for a non-profit organization .  As such, people think IT will accomplish various tasks not pertaining to upholding the network; i.e fix personal laptops, update iProducts, and etc.

**Story:**
As one of the part-time employees, I work on a limited time schedule(roughly 30 hours a week) and have been faced with end-user frustration.  Due to this limited schedule, My co-workers and I solved this by installing the Spiceworks ticket system.  It helped us organize and prioritize tickets with ease.  Staff members could e-mail or leave a written note on our desk to be put in the system.  *This lucky morning,* I received various notes stating that our network was experiencing issues.  Ugh, although this kind of thing isn't unusual as our providers are known for frequent packet loss.  I quickly skimmed over the written notes and continued my morning routine.  

When it came time to input these notes into the system, I found a gem in the stack.  The note contained the following:

-------------------------

* NICKY NOODLE
* Kiss with tongue &amp; handj**
* Sexuality
* Disco Ball
* Public Sexy Time
* The Queen of England &amp; Usher

-------------------------


Here's picture proof:

I wasn't sure how to go about this... But I did inquire with our providers and got some ""yeah we're on it"" statements.  

I haven't found the person that submitted this note and I hope they get their problems and questions answered.  

EDIT: I made the grave mistake of searching these terms on the web........

Space_Lobster,19,28,1qxvdp,63,"It was an early morning in the winter. It was a beautiful sunny day in the neighborhood- cool, but crisp enough to be enjoyable. This one day I received this deskto- Ok, this person was about 35-40 years old and refused to listen to anything I said-was acting like a two year old on candy and coffee, and I over-charged him for parts that were found just laying around. 

As usual, I take in the desktop and I asked ""What's the problem you're having?"" The customer points to the VGA port and starts to wiggle it. The explained to me they left the computer on during a thunderstorm and their internet on the computer stopped working. I said ""ok"". Then they proceed to tell me when one of their family members went to unplug it, they yanked the monitor chord too hard and it became loose. Now I'm smiling ear to ear. I figured it would've taken one or two parts and I was done with it. (I didn't have a basic video card on hand, so I calculated about a week with shipping the part). 

I take a look at the machine and noticed right away the VGA port is extremely loose, as soon as I open up the case, and remove the motherboard the VGA piece falls right off. (This was an old mobo, no DVI) About a week later I get the part, check out the internet issue, came to the conclusion the Ethernet port really was fried as well. So of course I add a new card for the computer. (By the way, this was just laying around) As I went to turn it on to test it, I get zero response. Do a power supply test, the power supply completely dies. I called the customer to let him know they amount of work I have done, and let him know about the power supply. (The power supply also was something just laying around) 

This is how the conversation went:


Me: Hello, this is Space_Lobster calling, how are you today?

Him: Took you long enough. (Really? It was barely a week)

Me: Well, sir I had to wait on parts that were on order, unfortunately I didn't have the parts just laying around.

Him: What was the solution? (As I already discussed a day prior)

Me: I had to replace the VGA, Ethernet and Power supply. 

Him: What happened to the video thingy?

Me: It came clean off the motherboard, and there was no way for me to really save it. (When I tell you clean, I mean you can't even tell it was meant to be there, it took some force to break as clean as it did.)

Him: What?

Me: (I explained how the VGA is on-board for about 10 minutes)
Him: So it fell off?

Me: *agitated* Yes.

Him: Can't you just...you know, put it back?

Me: *Facepalm and blind-sided* No...no I cannot. The new video card is only $15. (This I legitimately ordered) 

Him: Well, why?

Me: All the tracers are completely missing, I can't do anything other than replace it, even if I were to solder it, it would cost you a lot in labor. I'm saving you a ton of money right now. 

Him: What was the other things again?

Me: The Ethernet port, or as you know it as the Internet port was fried, but I was able to replace that without any issues.

Him: *grumbling* I said my internet wasn't working, why did you REPLACE it? You couldn't just fix it?

Me: trying to keep cool There was a short from the storm on the port, I tried all I can to fix the on-board, there wasn't much I could do for you other than a new part. 

Him: Great, just trying to rip an old man off. What about the other thing you did?

Me: I replaced your supply that died. 

Him: The what?

Me: The part that makes your computer turn on.

Him:**screaming** HOW DO YOU DO THIS TO ME? I'M NOT SOME ALIEN SCUM (INSERT RACISM HERE), I'M A GOOD WHITE CHRISTIAN (INAUDIBLE) 

Me: *hang up*

Him: *calls back*

Me: The next time you scream at me, I'm taking the parts back and giving you the computer just the way you gave it to me. (I quickly amazon a random power supply, print out the page as a receipt) The power supply will cost you $59.00 (It should have only been around $23 lol) 

Him: Fine! hangs up

At this point I don't see or hear from this customer for nearly a month. Finally comes in to pick up the computer. 

Him: How much do I owe you?

Me: ""$110 for labor, $90 for part"" (I was only going to charge him $50 for the fix at first, considering it was ridiculously simple as the parts should have only been around $35-45) 

Him: Staring at me

Me: Staring back 

Him: You really know how to rip people off, Best Buy would fix it for me for free.

Me: I really doubt that. 

Him: You shouldn't have the nerve to charge me that money, considering you've had it for over a month.

Me: I called you once per week to remind you it's here, how is this my fault you didn't show?

Him: You had it over a month!

Me: (To get him out of my hair) Fine, $100 labor. I'm not taking any less. 

The guy pays me, I give him the computer (normally I'll turn it on in front of the customer to show them everything is running like new.) In this case I simply just showed him the new VGA port and the new Ethernet port that he can now use. I'm thinking it's over at this point. His last remark had to be left.

""A real tech can fix things. I'm sure a geek kid would've put the parts back like I asked.""

Me: *facepalm*

Now I deal with a professional environment, even though the attitude is so much better, the stupidity is just the same.

Tl;Dr: Old man learns the tooth fairy isn't real.

vxstorm,4,15,1qxgr1,12,"First post here but I felt like sharing how I deal with those difficult clients, you know the knows that break something, ring you a thousand times blaming you and when you fix it, because you fixed it they still think it was your fault? Those clients...

So, I get into work to a lovely and polite help desk ticket (read abusive and idiotic) from one of our more difficult clients, I assign it to me as it should be an easy fix (authentication issue on them retrieving emails from the server if you were interested), I have a quick poke around the server for anything that pops out. Nothing really so I email them asking them to confirm that their passwords and usernames are correct etc etc the usual spiel.

I leave it for a bit and don't get a reply so I assume all is well and close off the ticket and get on with some ""proper"" work aka browsing reddit and writing scripts to make my life easier. Alls quiet on the help desk front so I prepare to get some real work done (why not, its already 2pm). Then I get a phone call... Its the client from this morning! Guess what? Their email isn't working, same error as before and that's when I realised that they weren't able to receive emails and so didn't get my reply from this morning *face desk*, because of my lack of response as you would expect (not really but its them) they are rather mad. I go through the usual troubleshooting steps, nothing seems to work. Wanna know why? The guy I was talking to wasn't even in the office, he was just saying he tried those steps (frigging hate those guys). I ask him to get someone from the office to ring me so we can actually get it fixed. He hangs up and before I've even settled back into my chair, I'm briefing the other developer about the ticket, saying how they might call back so if they pick it up could they deal with it in case I'm on another call? Sure thing said other developer, wrong call my friend.. I then did what any good tech support would do, I went to lunch!

I get back 40 mins or so later and the other developer has sorted it and I didn't have to pull out more of my hair dealing with the client, win win.

shiny_charizard_,50,40,1qx9zc,162,"I could probably retire by now. Especially when customers like this make me repeat myself five times. I try my best to be crystal clear when I tell them we don't have their files, but some of them seem to think that if they just keep bugging me about it, I'll magically find them hiding in a corner somewhere.

Background: Site hosting tech support. It goes like this. Customer gives us money. We give them storage space. When it comes time to renew, we send them a bunch of annoying emails saying something like ""hey we're gonna take your money, mmkay?"" and if we try to take their money and the payment fails (expired card, wrong security code, insufficient funds, etc) then we send them a bunch more emails saying ""hey we couldn't get your money, so that means you're not paying for data storage anymore... if you want to have sites on our servers, you gotta pay bro"" and if they still don't pay for their data storage, we deactivate their account. Their sites go offline for 3 weeks with an error that says to contact tech support. If they still don't do that, after 3 weeks of expiration, all files are deleted. If you didn't back up your files, you're a moron. INTERNET RULE #1: IF A FILE MATTERS TO YOU, HAVE MULTIPLE COPIES OF IT ON DIFFERENT HARD DRIVES. Whether this is your PhD thesis paper, or your website, make multiple copies of it so in case someone steals your hard drive, or a typhoon swallows your computer whole on your trip to the Phillipines, or if your account expires on a paid data storage service, you have another copy of it somewhere. 


Disclaimer: Personally I think we should keep data longer than that, but that data starts piling up fast, so I guess I can't really argue with that policy. They're not paying anymore, they're not a customer. Not my policy, not my rule, I'm just paid to deliver the bad news.

Something else people fail to understand: just because once upon a time we had a backup, it doesn't mean we will permanently have that data always and forever.

This poor sap submits an email about his account. 

**Him: ""My account was expired but I paid for it. But there's nothing there.""**

Me: ""Your account and all of it's files, databases, emails, backups, etc were deleted after 3 weeks of expiration, on [date]. You'll need to upload all of your files to the server again as we no longer have any data to restore.""

**Him: I didn't know this would happen. Last time my account expired you restored it. What can I do?** *looks like it probably wasn't expired for 3 weeks so when he renewed it, there were still backups*

Me: ""You can start new websites for your domains. We kept your data for 3 weeks after it expired but you failed to renew it quickly enough. All data, including backups, are deleted. On [expiration date], when it expired, we actually threatened to delete all data within 48 hours. However it looks like we did not, we kept it for 3 weeks. But you did not renew quickly enough."" *I also quoted the email which, surprise surprise, tells you that we're gonna delete your files if you don't renew your account*

**Him: I don't use that email account, so I didn't see this message. The files were deleted recently. You have some backup?. Please help me. I need those files. My clients have no backup. I'm desperate. Please help me. I await your response.""**

Me: ""We do not have any backups that we can restore. If you do not use that email address, it is your responsibility to update the email address on file to one you do use to make sure you receive important notices on your account. We kept your data for 3 weeks past it's expiration. All data was permanently deleted on the [deletion date]. We do not have any backups whatsoever that we can restore.""

**Him: ""I understand that. But a few months ago my account expired and you restored it.""** *doesn't change the fact that I've repeated myself 4 times in saying I don't have any files, whatsoever, that I can restore from a backup...*

Me: ""Your data has been permanently deleted, after your account was expired for 3 weeks. There is nothing further we can do.""

**Him: This time it was the same. It had been over three weeks and could be restored.""**

Me: ""We do not have any backups that we can restore.""

*As if telling him 5 times that we do not have any backups to restore, he opened up a live chat with another one of our technicians just to hear it from someone else.

roflwaffle666,8,12,1qx06d,35,"First time posting on TFTS, you guys are awesome.

Little background, I started working for my Uni's tier 1 tech support at the beginning of this year. Having some previous knowledge in the field troubleshooting comes as a sort of second nature. 

Anyway, move forward to today. I work in the libraries support desk and the way it's laid out is there is a giant circular desk in the middle with maybe 3-4 consultants and all around the desk are computers and printers (with colors as names for ex: Red Printer). 

So i'm sitting down at my workstation when a women comes up to me and we start this conversation:

Me: ""How may I help you?""

Women: ""I'm trying to print BnW but i'm not sure which printer to select.""

Me: ""There should be a printer labeled all_BnW_Uniname. Just select that one.""

Women:""But all of the printers are for different colors right? So the orange printer would print only orange?""

I then explain to her that they're just the names of the printers and they all print black and white and she thanks me and goes along her business.

Edit: I can haz spelling

At this point I turn around to my supervisor and he goes ""Next she's going to be asking if Linux comes with a real penguin."" and goes back to playing LoL. ",Just one color?,47
SkraeNocturne,14,8,1qwt6o,43,"Bit of backstory:

There's a ""server"" at one of our clients that runs the server software for their handheld scanners.  This software has a limit of about 60 connections at any given time.  This software (or at least their installation of it) has an issue with disconnecting sessions.  If a scanner goes to sleep or is otherwise taken offline, the connection remains open in the server software, even though it has nothing to connect to.  When the scanners come back online, they open a new connection in the server software, even though their old connection is ""open.""  The manufacturer of the software is aware of this and refuses to fix it because most of their customers aren't running as many scanners as the client does.  A quick note, this was apparently not by design, they discovered this when our client and one of our techs informed them.

So we set up a script to monitor when the connections are nearing the limit, send an email to our help desk to let us know, and restart the machine.  We are getting the emails, but it's apparently not always restarting.

Saturday, I got this email:

&gt;From:  Shipping person  
&gt;Subject:  &lt;program&gt; high importance  
&gt;Body:  Are &lt;program&gt; is down .Can you get it up

I don't work weekends.  Weekends are my day to run errands and relax, so I didn't see the email until 7 hours later.  If you have a high priority process go down, why would you email somebody on their day off?  Our help desk email and phone number are labeled on every computer they have.  I know because I put them there.  Using those will get the issue taken care of so much faster, instead of several hours later.

TL;DR:  ""This is high priority, I'll inform them using low priority channels.""",Just a quick one from the weekend.,51
TheLightingGuy,35,18,1qwt10,71,"So to start off, this is more of a rant than anything else but you guys would easily understand my concern. A good friend and colleague of mine have taken ownership of doing church IT work as their sysadmins. Wonderful people to work with with the exception of this one who keeps forgetting her password at least once a week. But she's not my issue. So a bit of a backstory

Before I came onboard to do this, I worked under their old It guy setting up Asterisk as a phone server. The guy was pretty chill, But something seemed weird about how he did things. It never clicked until recently. About 3 months ago, he just stopped returning phone calls, stopped responding to email, and has yet to stop in. 

Then one day something magical happened. The router he had setup (Linksys WRT54G flash with DD-wrt) just crashed and lost all the settings. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal except for the fact that our ISP has us running on a Static IP. So naturally, my IT senses kicked in and I started working away. The day later I sent in a quote for better equipment and it was approved. We ordered a Ubiquiti Edgemax router and 3 Long Range Wireless AP's (FYI if anyone wants a recommendation for that product, Streakwave is amazing!). Once we got those in, We took DHCP off the server and had the router take care of it, Setup VLANS to separate the staff, sanctuary, guest and phone networks, got up on a scary ass lift that you'd think would tip over any second trying to put the AP's up int he Rafters, and removed the old Router and routers that were setup to be AP's. 

Now here's the fun part. We haven't dared ask the Operations Manager (oversees everything from everyone) what the deal is with the Old IT guy. But my colleague and I just had to do some more snooping. 
We've found this all so far:

* Backups have not been done for over a year due to lack of space on the backup drives
* Server only has 5 CALS when there are at least 25 staff members that connect to the domain

And for the big WHAT THE FUCK one that made the operations manager super pissed off

* Trend Micro Worry Free agent has been out of date, with an expired not working license for over a year and a half

So currently, we seem to have taken over the entire church for their needs. We also are getting ~$2500 to fix most of our IT needs during the 2014 year. And lastly, Since I'm also an A/V guy, I get to be in charge of setting up our soon to be new conference room with all the goodies needed for anything they ever need. Don't get me wrong. Working for this church (as volunteer work for free mind you) is probably my favorite thing I've done and they're easily my favorite client since they're so easy to work with. I just wish the old IT guy kept track of things better because I'm sure you're all in agreement with me that some of those things listed are just inexcusable. 

TL;DR: Old IT guy didn't keep track of things and is probably going to be fired.

kaltag,13,9,1qwnfc,41,"Good Monday morning! I just finished up a 72hour PITA P2V migration of an old 2008 SBS server. I had tried the process the last 2 weekends but got random errors running the disk2vhd process on the data volumes. The conversion involved several TB of data so it had to be done over the weekend to be ready by Monday morning. I started the OS volume @ 5PM sharp Friday and let it go through it's disk2vhd process with no issue and it finishes about 10:00 AM Saturday morning. The other 2 data volumes I started and left to run. They are about a TB each of actual data. Sunday morning I check it and both disk2vhd processes failed with an ""invalid signature"" error again. Damn. At this point I'm sick of screwing with disk2vhd and this NEEDS to be done by Monday morning. Out of desperation I created 2 VHDs on the host server that matched the size of the volumes on the source server, mounted the VHDs and formatted them, then ran a robocopy from the source server to the administrative share of the VHDs. The robocopies finished without issue this morning about 5 AM. I then unmounted the VHDs, shut down the source server, attached the VHDs to the VM and started it up. After installing the integration services the drives were recognized and the shares came back. Phew. I got the network reconfigured and some misc issues resolved by about 8:15 this morning.

MrStonedOne,52,89,1qwdtk,348,"I work for a smallish small business IT consulting firm (Read: single digit employee IT support outfit with mainly word of mouth clients who run quasi-official companies out of their basement/home/etc)

Our accountant said his computer wouldn't turn on, so I came in to look at it: Sure enough, i could smell the magic smoke.

Take the baby back into the shop and go to do the standard hd swap to get it back up and running; Assuming that the psu and mobo were compromised, and the rest were on a short life

First thing I see is that a random molex connecter had black all over it, and a wire near it had melted, shorting with the molex connecter. ""Welp! There's your problem!"" Go to yank the drives out when I find [this beauty](http://i.imgur.com/jZ2Xuhq.jpg) with accompanying burn marks on the drive's circuit board.

Me and my boss yell a collective fuck, (Why this computer hadn't been backed up since summer i will never know).

Damage control time. (Read: desperate shit thats not gonna work) I grabbed some rubbing alcohol and q-tips and clean the carbon off the drives contacts. Plug it into a usb based sata reader and plug that into the shitty computer in the back. 

""This drive has not been formatted"".


Shit! Alright, down to earth time, I guess its not too bad, boss confirmed we still have hard copies of all the books. Accountant has an A+ Cert (He's a personal friend of the owner who knew more about bookkeeping when they were first starting this outfit up.) and should have known how to and why to do back-ups, Looks like he gets to work overtime re-entering the data into the accounting software.

I go to build up a new computer for him (with native sata support so it doesn't have a pos molex to sata connector). on a welm, i had popped the hard drive in the computer and attempted to boot it, hoping the usb sata connector was just being a shit. 

The post screen had came and gone, time slowed down, and I stared in the black abyss for what seemed like an hour, but was more like a second. I started to see a red and blue glimmer, ""can it be? is it?"".

I slump back in my chair as a wave of adrenaline and relaxation simultaneously hit me, and stare at it in all its glorious beauty: The Windows 7 logo. Let me tell you, you will never be as glad to see this glorious bastard than when you have un-backed up data on it's drive.

As the login screen comes up i snap back into reality. SHIT! I forgot to plug in the blank drive that was gonna replace this, where am I gonna back up his files to, i can't risk a reboot, this drive shouldn't even be alive.

I run to the other side of the shop and grab my laptop bag, grabbing my flash drive while thinking on the way back ""There were fucking burn marks on this drive's mainboard! Why is it working?"" Plugging it in I log in to the computer, and quickly start dragging folders over, listening closely for clicking.

Documents folder down, quickbook folder: down, time to just do the whole user folder minus whatever is read locked. 40%, 50%, 75%, 90%, \*CLICK\*.

I hear the sound of the hard drive spinning down and windows hangs...

Reboot time! ""Operating System not found. Press Enter to retry.""

everydaylinuxuser,38,39,1qwdc4,229,"The year was 1995 and I was a fresh faced student straight out of college into a large software house.

I was assigned to the London office to write Unit Trust software for investment banks but as they weren't ready for me yet I was placed in the IT department where for three weeks I would be imaging PCs and swapping out faulty network cards.

There were 5 of us new recruits in total, each fresh from office supplies carrying boxes full of stationery, including paper clips, pads, pens, scissors, post-its and a stapler.

The head of IT went through our instructions and told us about fire safety and the usual things you are told in an induction. 

During the induction I decided to play with the stapler, including loading it and then testing it...... on my thumb. 

As a staple went it to my thumb I didn't make a noise because I didn't want to disturb the guy who was speaking but he had seen it. He also watched in dumbfounded silence as one of his new recruits spent the next few minutes removing the staple buried deep into his skin.

Blood was spurting from the wound and to disguise the fact that I was in pain and that anything was happening at all out of the ordinary I put the thumb into my mouth to stem the blood flow. 

Now the bemused manager was facing a guy, who had performed an act of self harm, sucking his thumb like a small child who had just been sent to the naughty spot.

And the final nail into the coffin was when I decided the blood had not stopped flowing and so I decided to wrap it in a screen wipe (full of chemicals).

jaydude025,152,293,1qw7lx,846,"My partners brother is a complete moron.

I fixed a computer that was crashing and rebooting all the time by switching out the power supply with my old one and replaced the ram, while I was at it I also changed the thermal paste on the cpu as the pc had not been used in years and was all dried up. After about 2 hours of switching out parts and reinstalling windows and software I finally get the pc running normally again with no problems.

Now this is where the dipshit and his almighty knowledge of the gods comes in.

He is convinced that because I fixed it, it must still be broken because it was not him who fixed it, he takes my ram out and replaces it with new ram he just bought and the computer starts crashing with blue screens again.... 4 DAYS he is trying to fix that computer because he is convinced that the ram he JUST brought is not the problem despite the fact that is was working perfectly before he fucking changed it.

And so he finally buys new ram, And now cannot seem to install windows from a usb, absolutely refusing my help he spends the next full day staring at a blank screen like he is going to fix it using only the power of his mind!

Now it has been a few months since all this happened and it is working again, but only now has he realized that my power supply in still in there and he has brought a new one, he is also going to remove all my thermal paste and replace that to.

Now here is the good bit, I replaced the wifi card in it with a 300mbps one ""it only had a 150mbps card in it"" and now he thinks the new wifi card is too powerful for the computer and it is going to ""short it out and blow up""

And this is what I have to live with for the next several months.

PS: It is not his computer its the pc in the lounge room, I fixed it so my partner could use it.

Edit: He reinstalled windows because I installed my copy on there, and not his.

Richardrsb,13,4,1qvxwi,40,"I own a company in repairs of mobile electronics, PDA's Smartphones, and tablets.
Back in the days, Palm was the brand to go, and we repaired dozens of those smart
tiny boxes every day. I am talking 2003-2004. This is the Pre-Flash memory age, when the
power (battery) is removed, the  PDA obviously looses it RAM-contents.

While repairing a Palm m500 series, this happened. And the memory of this device contained 2 years
of vehicle administration. (Here in NL we need to keep record of our business-car usage, to avoid high taxes, so
this data is VERY important, because not being able to provide it, can be VERY costly TAX-wise).

Now, as a company we cannot be held responsible for users data, but it should be no problem, because
Palm, and all others provide its customers with powerful tool to back-up the devices data, in this case Palm desktop,
so a short so called ""hotsink"" will restore all data, including the sensitive and costly vehicle mileage data....
In addition, this particular model could also create backups to SD cards.....

 After the repair was complete, i returned the PDA to my customer. Het was shocked to see it was reset, and
no data was present at all. He shouted: ""All my vehicle data is lost, how are you gonna restore it?"" I replied: ""well,
your hotsync backup should do the trick. Simply put it in the cradle, and press a button. All you data will be restored in minutes!""

Turn out he never synced his device. Really never. He filed a complaint with his boss Vincent,  who paid for the repairs.
His boss was furious. Not to us, but to the employee.  Vincent mailed me a day later to tell me about the complaint, it turned out
that the owner of the PDA, was employed as an IT professional, and in particular was responsible for the company file server and the backups.

Unbelievable. The loss of his data costed him about € 4800.-

The year was 1995. 

Clinton was gearing up for his re-election campaign, the Bojinka Plot was exposed due to a chemical fire, the Oklahoma City bombing was perpetrated, and the Tokyo subway was attacked with sarin gas by Aum Shinrikyo.

However, as these are irrelevant to our story, we'll skip that and go straight to Houston, Texas, where an eleven-year-old fifth grader was headed to school with a rather hefty book in his backpack, one that most people his age wouldn't even begin to comprehend, let alone bother to pick up. He looked forward to the day of schoolwork, despite being bullied by his peers for being different and nerdy, and the many Macintosh computers at his school were an escape for him. System 7.5 had been released the semester before, and it had been installed across nearly every machine at the school.

""Number Munchers, Oregon Trail, Carmen Sandiego, OutNumbered, and Treasure MathStorm. Games all morning!"" he thought to himself as he walked in the school's front door and headed to his classroom. He picked up the copy of the Houston Chronicle that had been delivered to the school that day (20 to a classroom - some educational program paid for it), took out the front, local, business, and lifestyle sections, then snuck down the hall to the teacher's lounge.

Technically, he wasn't supposed to be in there. However, when it was the only room to get even halfway decent coffee...

Well, a detention would be worth it.

He retrieved a styrofoam cup of coffee, headed for the door...

He almost made it.

""What did I tell you about coffee?"" The computer teacher chuckled as she came through the door and took the boy's coffee, his disaffected grumbling not stopping her as she ruffled his hair. ""You'll stunt your growth!""

""Aw, come on, please?"" the boy replied, looking up at the woman with innocent doe eyes. ""It just tastes good and it makes me look more adult when I read the papers!""

""I thought I told you last week,"" she replied with a smile. ""Don't be in such a hurry to grow up. You'll get there eventually, and you'll always wish you'd spent more time as a kid.""

""The kids are stupid,"" he grumbled. ""They don't know how to not die of dysentery in Oregon Trail. They don't know how to catch Carmen. They keep asking me how to use the Fodor's guide! They can't even solve the math problems in OutNumbered before the TV goes away and they get zapped.""

The teacher knelt. ""Not all kids are like you, you know. Some are lucky, some aren't quite as lucky. Either way, don't complain. Just help them if they get stuck.""

""Fine, Ms. D.,"" he muttered. ""Can I PLEASE have my coffee? I have stocks to check.""

She shook her head and passed him the bubbling beverage. ""I don't want to know just why you're doing that.""

He scampered off, coffee and newspaper in hand.

**LATER THAT DAY...**

- - - - -

After being slammed around the playground into various pieces of play equipment, the boy was tired of it. He went into his sanctuary, the computer lab, and sat down at one of the Macs, then started a game of Number Munchers.

A pair of hands started mashing on his keyboard, causing him to look up in annoyance. ""Hey! Cut it out!""

The boy's malefactor shook her head and continued slapping his keyboard, causing the Troggle to eat his Muncher.

""What'd you do that for?""

""You're stupid,"" the girl sneered at him. ""You're a nerd and we all hate you. Go back to the school you were at before!""

Quiet anger and frustration bubbled up inside of him, but before he could say something, or do something, the computer teacher leaned over and tapped the girl on her shoulder.

""Ahem. You know you're not supposed to say things like that, right?""

""Sorry,"" the girl apologzed, quite insincerely.

""Get to your lunch break. You're not allowed in here right now. If I catch you acting like that again, you don't get to play games in here for a month.""

After the girl walked out, the teacher turned back to the boy and sighed. ""Look, they're going to come after you again and again until you stand up for yourself.""

""I know,"" he muttered quietly. ""I just don't know what to do.""

""Just don't hit her. It's not nice, and boys don't hit girls."" The teacher walked off, and the boy pulled the very heavy book out of his bag and started reading.

**THAT EVENING...**

- - - - -

The boy was in heaven.

His mother worked for the county teaching ESL (English as a Second Language) to Hispanic immigrants at that school on Monday and Wednesday nights, and sometimes, if his father was working late, his mother would bring him and his sister along with her, but she left them with the childcare crew... which, a lot of the time, took the kids to the computer lab and let them have three whole hours in it.

After a particularly good round of Carmen Sandiego, the boy returned to reading his massive tome, and an idea struck him, one with which he could revenge himself on his tormentor.

Fortunately, there were precious few children in the computer lab that evening, and the machine he went to was unoccupied.

After a few quick looks around, he slipped a floppy disk into the drive, and opened up a single program on it. He flipped through pages in the book, occasionally muttering to himself as he traced the words with his finger, clicking and typing the whole way, performing a veritable ritual on the machine, one with an unclear finish.

An hour later, he ejected the disk, shut the machine down, and went back to his book.

When his mother took him and his sister home, he felt a deep satisfaction, knowing that his class had the lab first thing tomorrow for a double period.

- - - - -

**THE NEXT DAY...**

- - - - -

""Okay, kids,"" the teacher called out loudly. ""Go to your assigned computers, sit down, turn it on, and get ready. Today I want you to play either OutNumbered or Treasure Mathstorm. Miss Weaver said that she wanted you all to brush up on your math skills.""

The boy went to his machine, complied with the teacher's request, and began playing. A short while later, the bully raised her voice.

""Ms. D! The computer isn't working!""

The teacher got up and went over, double-clicked Macintosh HD... and the Trash Can opened. She closed it, reopened it, and the same thing occurred. She opened the Trash... and Mac HD opened, with nothing visible inside it except the System Folder and some documents.

""Huh. Well, I'll have to fix this. It'll take a while."" She looked around, and there were no machines free. ""Well, there's no computers available, so you're going to have to do a packet of worksheets we have for math. Sorry.""

The boy smiled to himself at his workstation, and when the class went to its next period (lunch), he went over to the teacher, who'd had no time at all to work on the machine.

""Um, Ms. D? Can I help you fix the computer?""

She shook her head. ""I don't think so. This isn't something someone like you would know how to fix.""

""I think I kind of do know how to fix it, Ms. D. Can I at least try, please?

She shrugged and gestured to the machine. ""Be my guest.""

Twenty minutes passed, and a sea of typing and clicking came from the machine the whole while. The teacher had stopped what she was working on, and went over to watch the boy at work.

""So... someone renamed the Applications folder to a single space and deleted the icon?"" She stroked her chin. ""And then they changed the icons for Macintosh HD and the Trash Can, then renamed them to each other?""

""I think that's what happened,"" the boy said, a huge grin on his face.

She smirked and tousled his hair. ""And I suppose that that's going to happen to it every Tuesday and Thursday morning that you all are in my classroom?""

""I don't think so, Ms. D,"" the boy replied quietly. ""I only think I'm going to do it if she picks on me again."" He looked up in alarm at his faux pas. ""I mean, um... I just told on myself, didn't I?""

The teacher knelt down and looked in his eyes before hugging him and whispering in his ear.

""Told on yourself for what?""

The boy looked up... and a smile was on his face.

""Come on. I think I've got a few things to teach you,"" the teacher said, beckoning the boy to follow her into the computer room's storage room. ""I could use someone who can help me out with the computers here, and I think you're the right kid to do it, Jack.""

Tomagathericon,17,22,1quk95,144,"Bear with me please, because this needs some backstory.  
Some time ago, i was working for a smaller bank that employed lots of elderly women. They had only one tech guy, and he couldnt nearly handle everything the people needed, so most of the less important stuff just got ignored. Even though i wasnt actually hired as tech, i heard people complain about minor things and helped them out just cause it didnt take long. Word got around i made work easier for people, and soon, i was doing all the less important things that didnt require their official tech guy.  
  
So, one day, one of the women in charge for bank transfers complained to me that creating a transfer history for customers took very long.  
Now, to explain this, all the transfers are saved in a system called LDMS (Large Document Managing System), with different lists for each day.
In order to create a transfer history for a customer (these were usually created and billed per month), youd have to search the system for the customers bank account number and get his transfers from each of the lists manually (as each day was a seperate list).  

Now, youd think they would just copy what they need, paste it in a textfile, then print that file when they have everything. Nope, that would be too easy.  
Instead, what they did was print every single transfer, one by one, each on a new page, then get an empty piece of paper, cut out all the transfers they printed (this is the part where the shears come into play), glue them on the empty page, wait for it to dry, then make a copy of it which they would then send to the customer. Theyd usually require several of those since one piece of paper wouldnt hold more than half a dozen transfers that way.  
  
I tried to show them the magics of copy &amp; paste, and while they did notice it going much faster and easier, the next day they had forgotten about it and went back to their old methods. I believe they are still doing it this way.

My apprentice technicians were sweating mightily under the sustained incoming fire from a horrendous she-beast, who claimed that every time she used a certain computer, they would remotely shut it down on her. This was possible on some of the equipment, but only if you have the requisite access (which I surely hadn't given them) and know-how (being a heavily customized Linux system, it was not a simple thing).

A quick check of the access logs showed that was absolutely not the case.

Certain that my techs were blameless, I sallied forth into no man's land to draw the fire and see if I could not vanquish this demon back to her pit.

First thing I notice: she's not even on one of the machines that can be remotely shut down; the machine she is using is on a completely separate network specifically locked down as tight as possible for security, as it handles some classified data. So what she's describing is especially impossible.

&gt; SB: Your techs keep turning off this computer when I'm using it! It's not funny any more!

&gt; ME: I can assure you, that's absolutely NOT what is happening.

&gt; SB: Well, every time I use it, it turns off!

&gt; ME: Show me.

Now, this computer was installed in a 19' rack, with a pull out monitor/keyboard for the local user. Someone had placed a chair in front of it, but there was virtually no leg room at all. This was not an issue for the male users, who would tuck their feet back under the chair as far as possible, or just stand.

She-Beast, on the other hand, had a different approach. She twisted her legs off to the side, and proceeded to cross her legs at the knees. This became important when, after a couple of minutes, she became bored with the work she was doing and started to fidget as she continued typing.

Yes, she started to swing that raised foot back and forth a little; each time swinging closer and closer to the UPS power switch... And sure enough, eventually she hit the switch and turned off the rack.

Triumphantly, she turned to me to show me the fault... Only to find I was walking out of the room so I wouldn't have to laugh in her face.

*****

ADDENDUM: It turned out she would also sometimes hit the fuseholder next to the switch, partially dislodging the fuse. The other users would come across the fuse hanging out and just put it back in, never thinking to report the issue.

shadymanny,43,66,1qtv92,382,"Some years ago, I was assigned to a consulting gig in NJ for a large utility company.  Not really happy about it as I am from NYC, but whatever. I had gone in as a Citrix consultant, setting up a farm to serve up their apps.  While there I was to work with a very large, national IT consulting company.  The IT company was handling everything else, routers, switches, WAN and their Novell network.  

As I was setting up my farm, the network was really slow.  I took it up with the project manager of the IT company.  He was so confused.  I asked to look at his configurations.  Being a master CNE at the time, I pretty much noticed everything they did wrong.  Within a few hours, the network, WAN, Novell servers all flying...The CIO noticed and came down to talk to me.  

CIO asked me (a 24 year old punk at the time), to take over as project manager, ousting the very, very senior project manager of the IT company.  I took this seriously and went about undoing everything they had done incorrectly.  

Before long, the project was going great--everything worked well.  My company was pleased at the additional billable hours, the IT company was happy I bailed them out.  The CIO asked for another project, of which I can't recall, but happily obliged to help.  I also hinted he should replace the other IT company and bring in more people from my company.  So the CIO calls a meeting and starts to cut back on the large IT company's staff.

I go outside to smoke cigarette and bask in the glory of my coup d'état, when I spot something I had never seen before: a chipmunk.

lawtechie,46,127,1qts9b,666,"My first tech support gig was at an advertising agency. Mad Men it was not. 

For some reason, the office park had unreliable power- we'd have 1-5 minute shutdowns at least weekly. Ironically, we were less than a mile from the headquarters for the regional power company. 

So, to fix our intermittent power problems, we put an UPS in every cubicle. The artists got these serious 50 lb systems since they had 20"" CRTs. 

Regular users had some APC brick about the size of a shoe-box. 

One of my end-users, a female account executive sends in a ticket:

AE: Every time I have a presentation due, my PC shuts down randomly. Can someone please fix my broken PC?

So I look at her machine. Nothing's _obviously_ wrong with the PC or the UPS. I open her presentation on my PC. It's not corrupt or infected. No infections on her PC. 

All the cables under her desk are tight and velcro-tied, so there's no way she's inadvertently yanking power. 

Since we were slow with replacing batteries in the UPS, I suspect a weak battery. I swap out her UPS and close the ticket.

A week later, another ticket from AE.

AE: Please, please fix my PC! I had another presentation due today and it just powered off!



So I run up. Her manager and my manager are trying to figure out how incompetent, lazy and stupid I am. 
I absolutely can't replicate the problem. She's convinced her PC senses that she's got last minute work to do and it hates her. Her PC only shuts down when she's got a presentation on that day. I'm stumped but swap out _everything_- her PC, monitor, keyboard and UPS and make a note of it on the ticket. I'll check back with her daily.

Two days later, she calls me. It's done it again. I tell her not to do anything and I'll be right up.

She's furious. I can't let this one go, so I ask her to go back to what she was doing. 

I finally figure it out and start laughing. 

I ask her if she only wears high heels on presentation days. She does. 

I point out that she uses the UPS as a foot rest. When she's barefoot or wearing flats, the plastic ridges on the side of the on/off rocker switch on the UPS prevent the switch from being hit. 

When she's wearing heels, the heel is narrower than the switch and protectors, allowing her to hit the off switch long enough to power down the system. The spring tension in the switch moves it back into ON position by the time anyone comes back to investigate.

She starts laughing herself. I make a cardboard cover for the switch and she goes back to work.

Near the end of my shift, I get one last call from a younger woman who needs help getting several devices connected.

The first is a PS3. Its already connected to the network, has internet access, but it can not access the PSN. Being the nice gal I am, I decide I'd grab the ports for her. (Out of scope, but as this would be *much* faster than educating the CX about ports and where to get what she needs, I grab em from Sony's website.) I ask her to grab the IP address of the PS3 from the network config, and she's able to do it without any hitch. *SURPRISE*

No luck getting connected to the PSN. I decide to make sure its not the leased gateway causing any issues, so I DMZ the Playstation and have the CX restart it. When it boots, I ask to check the IP address again (DHCP and all). Same one, DMZ still valid. STILL unable to connect to PSN. Tell CX she's out of luck on that one. Tell her to try again when Sony's network isn't so congested. (Forums revealed problems)

smeltofelderberries,14,14,1qs7vg,82,"I'm a college student with no formal tech training. However, I enjoy computers and am decent at basic troubleshooting. Yesterday a friend put out a request asking if someone could disassemble a laptop. 

It turned out she had spilled water on her computer. Fortunately everything was backed up, but she had a paper to write that weekend so having her laptop would save her from having to try to get a public terminal at the library.

I carefully removed the screws on the back plate along with the battery. There were some big droplets of water in the battery area which did not seem like good news for the future of the computer. After I finished taking the screws out, we set the computer up in a partially opened position to dry both the keyboard and the bottom.

Cut to 8 hours later and we're going to try to put it back together. I reattach the screws, pop in the battery, and try to boot. Unfortunately, there is no response from the computer. I suggest plugging in the power adapter. After fiddling with the surge protector, it gets plugged in. Again, no response from the computer. As my gut begins to churn, my friend realizes that one of us bumped the off switch on the surge protector. Attempt three is a success, the computer boots, and the day was saved.

Being I had remoted it, the screen wasn't so sharp--I wanted to make sure he didn't rename his printer with some random numbers.  Nope, he had 27000+ print jobs waiting.

midashand,22,28,1qrsy2,128,"Hello again everyone!

In my spare time, I still do some random freelance work for friends of friends and business in the area. This was essentially how I started my IT career, but I've mostly moved on. However, there are still a few people/businesses that I still look out for when they need IT help.

A few weeks back, I get an email from local business owner, Tom. Tom says something along the lines of ""The two front desk computers keep dropping connection to QuickBooks. Can you come take a look?"" After a bit of finagling, I managed to get him to send me a ""screenshot"" of the error so I knew what I was getting into: http://i.imgur.com/djmDRfU.jpg *Ugh, this doesn't look pretty....*

The way the business is set up, Tom has his computer in the back where the sales/accounting stuff happens that uses QuickBooks multi-user mode to allow the two front desk computers to process payments and invoices as well.

It is a this point that I should mention I despise and detest QuickBooks and refuse to work directly with it. If Tom needs help specifically with it, he contacts a colleague with an accounting degree that is also tech savvy. 

Anyways, I head over after work and start digging in to see what I can find. The first suspect is the new All-In-One router that the business recently installed when they switch internet providers. I can't find anything wrong there, all the computers have (slow) internet and everything is fine.

Next suspect is Tom's computer. ""Tom"", I said, ""Has anything odd been going on with your computer lately?"" ""Any trouble with Quickbooks?""

""Nope"", hey says, ""everything's working fine. My QuickBooks never gives me any errors, its just up front. ""

After a quick Look-See myself, yep it all looks good. No abnormal behavior that i can see.

And this is where I started pulling my hair out. I tried everything I could think of. I tested the wiring, as some of it is ancient. I replaced the switch that feeds the back room Ethernet ports. I ran Cat6 all over the floor going from router to computers. I tried swapping routers. I couldn't find ANYTHING wrong with any of it.

Now, please keep in mind: I have a full time job. I am doing this work in the evenings. Tom wants to go home. I want to go home. I usually stay for an hour or so, and then come back a day or two later.

Two weeks later, I had given up. I simply couldn't find anything wrong with any of the computers or the network. I let Tom know I was at a loss and that he was probably going to have to hire some ""big guns"" to figure out what the deal was. 

I was depressed. I'd worked for this shop since before I started college. They had never had a problem I couldn't tackle. I'd burnt hours of my free time over the last two weeks trying to figure it out. With each knew idea, I thought ""Ah! Surely this must be it!"", only to be crushed beneath the weight of failure again.... I was depressed and dejected. 

A few days later (Last Monday) Tom sends me the following picture with a note, ""Hey Midashand, my computer just gave me this message this morning when I tried to turn it on and its making clicking noises"": (Yep, you know where this is going) http://i.imgur.com/HHcmLYb.png

""SWEET MOTHER MARY, TOM!!!! THAT'S THE CAUSE!!!! YOU TOLD ME YOU HADN'T BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS!!!!"" 

Since I was only there for an hour a day, I was limited in my ability to check for hardware problems without bringing the whole sales system down until the next evening when I came back. I couldn't very well leave Tom without a computer while I chased ghosts with diagnostic tools for hours on end. And truthfully, his system was behaving perfectly normal. No weird sounds, no delayed HD access, nothing. Besides, after repeated assurances from Tom that nothing was wrong, checking system hardware wasn't even on my radar. I forgot rule #1.....

""Well"", he said, ""I guess Quickbooks had been locking up every now and then... but it never gave me any errors so I figured it wasn't a big deal."" *facedesk*

A quick use of Amazon Prime landed a new hard drive on my doorstep a day later and I got to spend the ENTIRE evening installing Windows and related software. (Also, side rage note: WHY DELL!? WHY DO YOU REQUIRE A 1.5TB+ HARD DRIVE TO USE THE RECOVERY DISC!!!!) *ahem* I even managed to get most of his data off. Although his 7.5GB .PST file died a horrible death. Not even really sure what was in it.... His email is still on the server, but definitely not 7.5GB worth....

Anyways, Everything is fine now, QuickBooks is purring along... Although I'm sure its just a ruse as it contemplates its next attack.....

acthrellis,174,214,1qrlh3,819,"**WARNING: LONG RANT**

**Background**:  I am not nearly as smart as most of you, I never went to college, just took some begininer (PC Repair &amp; Networking) classes at a tech school, and then studied certifications on my own.  2 weeks ago I was promoted from a temp position to a full-time IT position, in a company with no in-house IT department.  I've never had an official fix-it job, I freelance when unemployed, and have always been the resident my-mouse-is-possessed-help-me go-to, so this is a huge step for me.  Our company has been RAPIDLY growing and expanding over the past year, so much that no one can keep up, and they can't hire people fast enough.  We have almost a dozen separate IT firms contracted, each one for something different.  One for email, one for helpdesk, one for internet, one for voip, one for each piece of proprietary software, etc.  Shit's crazy.  They have discovered about 3 years too late, that this isn't going to work, and we need our own IT.  Enter me.  I am starting out by supporting our brand-new, custom-made software that goes out to our facilities.

I always assumed it was just ignorance, not pure stupidity.  That all people needed was a chance to learn, and they'd eventually be okay on their own.  *Stop laughing at me.*  So here, are couple from these last two weeks that completely blew my mind.

**Lady calls in, can't login to software.  I have her walk me through what she's doing:**

Lady: ""I open the thingy, click my name, and click the login button.  It's giving me some error.""

Me:   ""Did you type in your password?""

Lady: ""What's a password?""


Now the best part of this: The very first time you attempt to login to this software, it forces you to choose a password.  You cannot ever use this software without personally setting up a password.  I look into her user profile, and it's (I swear I'm telling the truth) ""suckdick12345.""  So, 1.) she has obviously logged in before, and 2.) I am not allowed to do password resets (IDKwhy), I have to tell them their password over the phone.  Ugh.


**Another lady calls in.  The billing reports are all screwed up.  I find out that she can see the future, and is effectively discharging patients before they've received any treatment.  I don't know how this works in her head, because the patients don't leave until they're ready to leave, so.. uhhh.  Anyway, I tell her this, and she says:**

Lady: ""But I like my way.""

Me:   ""I understand, but this is how the system works.  Wouldn't it be much easier to do it right the first time, instead of having to go back in multiple times every day to edit the patient?""

Lady: ""No, because I'm right.  Also, I don't like the color of the software, can you make it pink?  I think if it was pink people would be much happier at work.  And add a link to Facebook so I can check my friends when I'm bored.""

Unfortunately, my phone immediately ""dropped"" the call right then.  Weird.


This got way too long, so I'll save the others for another time if anyone's interested.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the resources and observations!  Like I said, I'm new to this level, and I can't tell you how much you're helping me.

plasmastorm_,34,14,1qr1n9,124,"I do general residential and small business support. Got called out to a client's house to ""connect the printer to out new laptop as we can't seem to get it working""


""No problem"", I say, allowing 20 mins for a simple install of drivers.


I arrive to find a Chromebook and a Lexmark printer, and a completely computer illiterate client. I ask where their main PC is, so I can install Google Cloud Print to share the printer with the chrome book... ""Oh, the Vaio? We just binned it now we have this new one... also, where's the DVD drive on this one? We wanted to watch a film last night and couldn't. And can you please install MS Office and &lt;proprietary windows-only software&gt; we need to work from home.""


I explain to them that the Chromebook doesn't run Windows, won't work with their current printer, it wont play DVDs, the closest they'll come to MS Office is Google Docs and their home working software won't work. I explain that a Chromebook is designed mainly for simple web use and probably not right for their usage, and suggest maybe they take it back and exchange it.


""Can't you make it work? It's nice and shiny and it was cheap."" They plan to keep the Chromebook and ""get our IT guys at work to make it work“... Yeah good luck! They have bought an HP ePrinter though, so at least they can print, and I went back to set that up for them.


Don't get me wrong, I like the machine itself. Might even get one for out and about... But they've bought it without doing the simplest of research and it's not right for them.

sharpie32,60,161,1qqw7h,433,"So I was talking about my student loans in /r/explainlikeimfive/ and I briefly brought up my first work experience.  A couple of cool cats asked me to go into detail about it because I mentioned the entire IT crew intentionally jumped ship at the same time and a propane tank explosion (unrelated, but how fukkin' cool would that be.)

I started the job as a ""Security Intern"", which included your average help desk work like fixing keyboards and monitors and answering questions, but also meant I got to do audits of the University.  It was unpaid, but it was ""relevant work experience"" that I knew I would desperately need.  This was fine, because it was the opening to a lot of really cool shit that I got away with.  We had something called a Computing Commons where students had access to specialized PCs.  Some of them had Dev SDKs for games.  Some of them had Autodesk.  Mostly kids used them to play Minecraft or WoW or Heroes of Newerth.  During that time there, I had Admin on those systems and so I knew most of what was going on with them.  If one went dark, I knew where it was and could go fix it usually by imaging it or pulling it into the IT Dept if it was hardware related.

This was well and good until one day I strolled in and discovered that one of my friends who was the ""Security Technician"", essentially my boss and getting paid, was quitting.  He hadn't graduated yet, but had a better job lined up.  Guess who got the bump up?  This guy.  $11/hour to do the same shit I was already doing.  FuckyeahSeaking.  So now I was on payroll and shit was going smooth.  I could pretty much make up my own hours.  I had the Client Systems triage fukkin' down.  I wasn't building the images or doing the complex stuff, but the IT Arch-wizards were glad I was there.  I allowed them to focus.  I was the one who absorbed and deflected the idiocy and I got paid.

All great things do eventually go sour though.  (And you do have to know the sour to really enjoy the sweet.)  I walked in another day and there was something wrong.  It wasn't the typical angry typing in silence when you knew something was wrong with a server...  It was different.  You could smell it in the air.  You could smell what I could only describe as the fresh tears of an Admin.  (I own that name OldSpice, fuck you.)  Come to find out that the Client Systems Admin, who was my boss now, was changing his grades.  Now, you might ask why was a student the Client Systems Admin?  Well, because that's how you do it when you're a diploma mill!  Who can you pay less than one of the students you're supposed to be educating?  Well anyways, he didn't deny it and he could've got away with it if he hadn't become too greedy.  But alas, guess who got bumped up again?  Not this guy, actually.  No one did.  Which was okay, because he was a cool guy and left us with a very stable image of XP that accommodated everything we'd need for at least a little while.  So life went on with one less friend, because he left mid semester and never actually graduated.

Now's the best time to tell you about the IT Staff.  There was J, who handled all of the servers and their services and S who handled all of the network infrastructure and the systems security.  J forgot more things about Windows and Linux administration than I'll ever know.  S was the kind of person you were thankful wasn't a foreign national.  He was the kind of guy who lived for getting shells and man could he get shells...  (Getting a shell is a loose term for exploiting a system and getting a payload into memory that gives you a shell on that system.)  Finally, there was M.  M was the IT financials and the magic he could work over the phone with suppliers will never be rivaled.   ""But that's all?"" you ask?  Yes, these 3 guys managed a University of too many.  They did it alone.  They did it entirely without thanks.  There were times when it seemed like the stress would be too much, but they believed they were making it a better place.  They thought that if they weren't there, then who would protect the neckbeards?  Certainly not their parents...  They paid for them to be here.  To get them out of their basement.  There *was* also the IT Manager, R.  He was one of the greatest guys I ever knew.  He had a lot of other roles to fill, but he trusted J, S, M, and I and so we were largely unmanaged.  It was how we survived and it was how the school survived.

One day, sitting with us in our circle of chairs, R just slammed his fist down, stood up and said ""I don't usually do this, but unless any of you object, I'd like to bring Sharpie32 on full time.""  No one objected and I swear to you that was one of the most prideful moments of my life.  By the end of the day, there was a contract on my seat.  I found out later that it was one of the last things he did before he quit.  I was sad, but I was also happy because I was making more money than I had ever in my entire life.  **$32k/year.**  (FYI: happiness and sadness are not two great tastes that go great together.  They are not peanut butter and jelly.  More like jelly and shit because I imagine peanut butter would take away some of the shit taste, but not jelly...)

Shortly after him, S &amp; J quit as well.  I'm pretty sure R knew they would quit too, but I have nothing but my perspective on the whole thing.  I don't remember who had a job lined up first, but J and S explicitly timed it so that both of them would leave together.  This was mostly because of politics, but also because there was never time for a rest or vacation.  Their palms would sweat on their keyboards from the stress of managing these systems alone, with thousands of students and staff depending on them.  With the CEO explicitly not hiring on more staff, things were just slowly falling apart and they were sick of it.  Sick of not being paid enough (I found out later they made $45k/year each there.  Both had put in 3 years at least, never a raise or vacation.)  Sick of the disrespect;  we'd have this bitch of an old woman walk into the office and just shit talk about it because there were computers in various degrees of repair.  We would have to drop everything, no matter how serious, and arrange ticketed computers that interns were working on in neat little piles because who knows fucking why, fucking up everything the interns just did to troubleshoot.  There were also days, once a month, where we'd be locked in one of the theaters for the entire day while the President would masturbate himself and his circle of investor assholes and tell us about how things were going to get better and ask us what we thought.  No one ever put forward anything useful or critical because they were afraid of getting shitcanned.  (As a footnote:  If they'd known that one day a few years into the future, they'd be lined up (literally) and fired one by one like they were pigs getting slaughtered, I'm sure they would've done things different...  But anyways.  I couldn't get fired, because it was me solely responsible for the Microsoft and Linux infrastructure, the network, and the client systems and M who bought everything and could quell the beast that was the staff and faculty.  So at least we had that going for us, which was nice.

Things really started going down hill close to Christmas time though... that's when we rotated the systems in the Computer Commons.  Obviously this is a problem for Windows XP.  Windows 7 was coming out and our image, which I didn't know how to Admin beyond pushing to systems, was hella outdated and work for me was piling up because of it, because of the servers, because of the network.  I made the decision to drop Ghost, mostly because I hated Symantec, but also because we had Microsoft tokens out the ass and Windows Deployment System was apart of the technology M$ tokens supported.  Keep in mind, I didn't know dick about doing this.  So I learned from the ground up and I burned through tokens like a pimp making it rain and in 2 months we went from shitty XP to a less shitty Windows 7 environment.  But also in that time, I went from not being on Adderal to being on a prescription and my hair went from not falling out to falling out and I went from not putting on weight to eating like a fucking hog.

Why was the Windows 7 shitty?  Well partly because I was still learning, partly because we were using roaming profiles, and partly because for the two weeks before the migration I was alone in the IT department frantically trying to build these images, discovering if you didn't set the skipRearm flag before you sysprep'd an image 3 times, you irreversibly fucked your image.  Seriously, when Windows 7 first came out, that was pretty much undocumented.  I remember when it started getting cold.  They shut off the heat in the University because it was usually empty.  I remember it reaching 32 in there and I sent M a text, saying ""Hey man.  I'm freezing in here.  I have a jacket but I'm still really cold, my feet are numb.  Can you call maintenance, I can't find their number.""  He sent me back ""lol.""  I never did get the heat on in there and so for the last two weeks before the deadline, I fought the freezing cold to make that shit happen.

So can you imagine being 20, being solely responsible for this kind of environment and standing before 300 computers, starting to image them all and knowing, just fukkin' knowing that if this didn't work, that you were going to fuck up not just your own day but **everyone's** day.  You'll never guess what didn't work.  (Spoiler:  Pretty much everything.)  It took 8 hours to image 40 systems of the thousand we had, because I could never figure out where the multicast was getting lost at in the network, each one was being handled unicast, creating its own link to the server, creating a read to the same exact single Windows Image file.  I felt really fuckin' clever when I set up a RAMFS and placed the image in there to speed things up a bit.  But never the less, shit did not work.  Shit did not work for a long time.  At first it was that no one could log in.  I fixed that, it had to do with the roaming profiles and how we had a system variable reference a certain value which affected what roaming profile they'd pull based on what the system was supposed to be.  Then it was all of the undocumented ""bandaids"" that had been wiped away in XP.  Things like printers and start menu customizations and shit that people needed like shortcuts to shared folders instead of using the fucking network maps under Start &gt; Fucking Computer, because they were Babyboomers and change scared them.  Some of them were even worse Babyboomers and just flat out wouldn't use Windows 7.  I had to go back to XP for them and personally educate them on everything about the transition.  Which, believe me, can be a lot if you're not up for figuring it out yourself.  All the while dealing with shithead kids that would torrent the network into the ground, an undocumented network and server infrastructure, and updates that had to be done manually.  There were nights I just slept in the Computer Commons, because it wasn't worth the drive home.

Shit was still fucked up around Valentines day.  The students were never so pissed off that they threatened to leave though.  They fucking should have though.  I would have, if I wasn't me...  They didn't give a shit though.  They could still play video games and that's all they ever needed.  Valentine's day was important to me, because the staff and faculty fuckin' rolled into IT that day and brought me a pile of candy the size of my dick.  (For the record, popcorn comes in 4 sizes: Small, Medium, Large, My Dick.  You get the idea.)  One of them even brought me a pig with a heart sewed into its hands.  One pissed off day a few months later, I actually cut the heart out of its grip so that it was just a pig.  She found out and sewed that shit back together.  I wish I'd taken that pig when I left...

Things eventually settled down though.  I persisted, overcame, and continued to do the best I could.  They were worried about the security of the systems, and they fuckin' should've been, so they hired another student who was and still is one of my best friends.  He took over the network and security and helped a ton there and for a short while it was him, who I'll call D, M and Sharpie32.  I was able to focus down on the Windows  images and I was making real strides.

Then one day they hired a new IT Manager.  That was pretty much when things started going down hill.  I could've survived and probably would've stayed there a lot longer if they hadn't brought this guy on.  The President actually hired him because he wanted to keep him on a sports team the President played on.  He hired him because he wanted to own a human being.  And so he did.  This guy gobbled the President's balls and absolutely swallowed the gravy.  Anything the President wanted, this guy would do and worse yet the guy had no management experience.  None at all.  Guy didn't know dick about management, so most days I would literally pretend there was an emergency and go take a conference room so I could get work done.  It was that or having this fucking guy act like Napoleon Dynamite and play Lindsey Sterling videos.  He ruined that shit for me.  Not that I liked it that much, but I went from ""Meh"" to unconditionally hating that shit.  He'd talk about wanting to ""bang"" her in his shitty Napoleon Dynamite voice, which was his real voice.  Nevermind the fact that he had a wife and kid.  (A kid that looked like a Nair'd chimp by the way.)  Eventually, they brought on a guy that swore he knew vCenter.  They needed this because they wanted a virtualization professional for a really stupid project that I won't go into detail about.  Guy didn't know how to use a serial cable to connect to vCenter.  I had to educate a guy who was making more than me on fundamentals of Server Administration with a usb to serial cable, which was fine, but the guy was making more than twice my wages.

Needless to say, shit got pretty tense in there.  M, D and I were brutal in our reviews of the new IT Manager and the President didn't like it.  Of course, they let go of the guy they could to make a point.  They shit canned M.  I was furious, but there was nothing I could do except continue doing my job.  He left and the best I could offer was a going away present.  Universally, up until the new IT Manager, we were all huge gun enthusiasts, M especially.  He found zen in the long distance shot.  He owned a rifle that I've long since forgotten but was chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum.  I called him up shortly after the shit canning and we negotiated his going-away present:  The opportunity to shoot a ""grill size"" full propane tank out in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

So of course we had to do this in the wee hours of the morning.  Got there at 3AM, had to take some pretty mean trails that only a lifted vehicle could make and when we got there, it was still pitch black.  Stars look different when there's no light pollution to fuck with your night view.  

**EDIT 1:**  So anyways, we're out in the middle of this park in the wee hours of the morning and he's stoked and I'm stoked and I walk it about 150 yards out to the side of a giant hill.  You don't know terror until you're out in the wilderness 150 yards away from the only light, which is a truck's low beams.  There's just something about it that makes you understand why fire was the first thing we figured out.  But anyways, I dragged that shit out there with my knife out because I sure as shit didn't want to get eaten by a bobcat or something.  Looked back and saw that it lined up pretty well and briskly jogged back...  Terrified.  I get back there and M's like...  dude, where'd you put it?  I look back and it's too fuckin' dark to see it.  So I break open my emergency kit from the truck and there's a glowstick in there.  I walk out, tie that shit on, and finally get back.  M's already prone and stoked to fire by the time I get back.  I instantly regret the decision but because he needed this, I looked from in the bed of the truck over the cab.  What felt like an hour was probably 30 seconds as M zeroed in, prone, and took his shot.  The round entered the tank very off center but straight on creating what I can only describe as a spinning machine of death.  At first you could see it spin because of the light, but it quickly picked up enough speed to throw that off. That's when, for the second time that night, I discovered what terror really is.

It sound like some kind of helicopter getting up to take-off speed, but somehow it hit something in the ground and it jetted probably 40 or 50 feet to the right, from my perspective and proceeded in typical asshole fashion to start spinning up again.  It did this two more times toward us, during which I truly thought it was intentional, but finally died down.  After it stopped spinning for the last time and silence returned, I looked down and M was still prone.  He'd never moved.  He just, in the epitome of alpha male badassery said ""cool.""  We both walked out to get it, partly because you don't leave shit behind when you go out in nature and blow stuff up, but also because he wanted to show his 8 year old daughter.  He said she loved this kind of stuff.  We shot some targets after that, then went home when others started showing up with similar ideas in mind.

helpdesk1478,12,11,1qq8ia,64,"So this doesn't relate to my work in tech support, but it relates to my home DSL connection.  A couple of months ago we had a huge thunderstorm.  The next day, I see that our DSL modem has a red light.  Aw shucks.

So I disconnect it, plug it in at the box.  No joy.  Phone line connected to the box and as far as I can follow it back. I see no problem.  

So I call our derp ISP, A Technical Tempest.  After making me run all over doing the same things I'd just done, they said the line test failed.  Well, yeah.  I told you as much.  The fastest they would send a tech was three days.  No budging.

When the tech finally got there, he followed the line back thru my neighbors yard (which I can't see into because of hedges).  Turns out, the storm had knocked down the line and my derp neighbor CUT IT.  TWICE.  From where it entered his yard to where it exited, gone.

Theory5,14,19,1qprf5,72,"So I am working with Networking to try and fix some issues with a third-party product that both our teams use. I had an issue and sent it to the contact on our side to talk to the contact on the product support side. The contact on our side gets back ""it'll be fixed in the next upgrade...""

The company that built the product didn't give any more information besides that. I found that fishy, so I dive into the documentation. The closest bug I found was listed as a ""known issue"" in both the current versions release notes, and the upgrade release notes.  Odd...

So I called up our contact on their side, as i was tired of talking through 2 people just to ask a simple question. The guy tells me to email him my problem. I did, along with a request asking if I had the correct bug #, and why there was the discrepancy between the engineer and the release notes. I get back ""It'll be fixed in the next upgrade.""

Ok, now I'm suspicious. He didn't confirm or deny that the bug # was correct, so I sent back an email asking two questions:

1) DO I have the correct bug listed?

2) Why is there this discrepancy? 

I get back ""I'll have to check with support, what is the original ticket #?""

Now, the contact on MY side is telling me that she was ASSURED by the sales engineer that it's a known bug (even though they didn't give her a bug #) and the next upgrade will fix it and ""It's a science, its not always so black and white. That's why they call it computer SCIENCE. Just because the company knows about it doesn't mean they have a bug# for it. I would trust the engineer, he knows what he is talking about.""

ilawlfase,10,10,1qpnc9,35,"I work for a partner company of a big ISP.  I get all the calls that the ISPs techs don't really want to handle [or it seems that way sometimes].  Honestly, most of the time, it's very very simple fix.  Occasionally it's actually a computer issue unrelated to the router, but still an internet issue.

But today, I got a small warning.  Beeping in the background.  At first, I thought nothing of it and thought it was simply another tech tranferring a customer to me.  So I do my greeting as usual and wait for a tech to let me in on what's going on.  No.  There was a tech, but they didn't brief me.  They just let the customer at me.  Right away she told me the tech transferred her to me, and her monitor wasn't showing anything.  I knew I was gonna have a bad time.  I mean, at worst your internet can make you blue screen under certain conditions.  Then she let me know ""the big black box"" won't stop beeping.  Then tells me that it's been fixed by us before.  I know people that were doing my job did not fix it, as it's not in our job description.  But I do know that some of my higher ups could have done it, but that costs money...something that my job does not [at least not to the customer directly].  I do know of an issue with windows 8 drivers not being installed correctly and it bluescreening the customer.  Maybe another windows 8 customer?

Cs: ""I don't remember"" [eh, this is common]
Ilawl:  ""Is it new?  How long have you had it?""
Cs: ""No, I've had it like 3-4 years.  I don't know.  I don't usually use windows, I only use the computer for the internet.""

At this point, I mute myself.  This woman clearly doesn't know what windows is.  I really don't want her to hear me screaming: ""I""M DONE""

Of course I'm not done.  I return to the call and she continues telling me that the techs from my company fixed her issue.  I put her on hold so I can talk to my supervisor to make sure I'm on ill advised on what we actually do.  I'm newish, but I really don't think I'm wrong on this.  They tell me to send her to an outside technician, or get her to my higher ups who will charge her.  I begin to ask her if she had that service before, since we took away all previous subscriptions to the service so they wouldn't have to be charged for basic tech services.  She tells me she never had a service like this, but the modem isn't working because her monitor isn't showing anything.  I proceed to tell her the topology [simplified] of how her computer connects to the internet and how she views it.  I tell her the monitor is connected to her computer, and her computer is connected to the internet.  I cannot fix her internet [if there is even an issue] until her computer is fixed.  She says she knows but it's happened before and the big black box won't work.

I know now that the beeping was probably a RAM issue and she's probably had that problem since she started with our service.  Probably not our fault other than providing internet to someone who would make a computer cry like that.


The call ended with her telling me [with clenched teeth I could tell] ""To have a nice day."" and she hung up on me as I was explaining to her the 3rd time that it wasn't our fault.

KCCOfan,6,8,1qpgki,73,"So a few years back, I was working for an Actuarial firm, when one day I can hear a beeping sound coming from one of the offices behind the IT dept. I walk over, following the sound, to find one of the senior staff looking at his laptop with a confused look on his face. ""It's weird, it just started making this beeping noise, I rebooted and now I'm stuck here"". So I walked over and had a look. The laptop was stuck at the BIOS so I suggested that it may be a stuck key on the keyboard. I pressed all the keys, to see if perhaps there was some thing sticking. No joy or response from the keys. 
I said to him ""It looks like the keyboard is broken, I'll take it and replace it with one of our travel laptops"" ""Awesome!"" he said.
So I unplug the power and lift the laptop. The moment I lifted the laptop, out pours half a cup of hot coffee all over the desk and floor. ""We'll there's your problem"" I said. ""You've spilled your coffee into your laptop. It's a good job I didn't get electrocuted!""
""Oh"" he said. (At this point, I have no idea how I stayed calm. I should have hit him over the head with the laptop) ""I didn't realize that much coffee had gone inside!"". To which I said, ""Why didn't you just tell me you spilled coffee in the first place? You're an actuary, can you not put 2 &amp; 2 together?"" - nervous laughs were had by all.

how_it_do,18,37,1qp8fy,196,"November 14th. It was 4:55 PM. I was closing shop for the day when suddenly my employer calls me into the back office. He shows me a blank piece of paper. He must sense the confusion I feel, and starts to explain what it means.

""The scanner isn't working!"" he exclaims, waving the paper in my face.

""Let me take a look at it"" I say, fearful of facial paper cuts.

I approach the scanner, looking for signs of potential failure. I look at the monitor beside it, displaying the program required to use it. There's a document displayed on the screen. I try printing it and receive another blank page for my effort.

A thought occurs to me, one that couldn't possibly be correct. This scanner has been used for five years or more, could this possibly be the source of his problem? I lift the lid of the scanner. Lo and behold, there is nothing underneath. The document in question has been removed before it could be printed.

""Where's the paper?"" I ask, glad the solution was as simple as that.

""Why do I need the paper? It's already on the screen!"" he says, becoming irate.

I am unsure of where his confusion is coming from. This is a process he has done correctly for over five years with no problem at all.

A sudden realization comes to me. He's a victim of IPA - instantaneous procedural amnesia. Symptoms include forgetting a step in a process ever existed, becoming angry when told that the process hasn't changed, and becoming even more angry when told the process can't be changed to fit the new perception of how it should work.

There is no help for those who suffer from IPA. The only thing you can do is attempt to placate them and say it's just the computers acting up again as they are wont to do from time to time.

Agtsmth,3,7,1qp45n,51,"Long time reader first time poster. You get the picture. 

Many moons ago I was a field engineer for a large company that we will refer to as ""IQ"". IQ had lots of large service contracts for onsite support all over the country. The contract that I spent my time on was a large financial institution that we will call ""CPB"". CPB had a server farm in my area so we rotated on call rotation for it. The major problem with CPB was that they never kept their run book up to date. 
So at 5 on Thankgiving day I got a page for a server. 80% of the time it was an IIS server that stopped responding. A quick reboot later you were enjoying your holiday. This would not be the case. The machine in question was an IBM blade that was recently installed by another technician in my group. We will call him ""F"". After getting the location from ""F"" and him telling me that this blade was in a development domain I asked the customer if they wanted to lower the response time. Nope. Ok then.

The systemboard on this unit needed a replacement. Easy you say? Nope. Since it was new CPB wanted IBM to replace it. Que call to IBM for warranty service. One thing I like about IBM is they don't play nice without a contract. So I hop on a conference call with the CPB NOC, IBM, and whoever their oncall admin was. The call went something like this.

CPB NOC: ""Hey we need a systemboard for this unit right away!""

IBM: ""Do you have a contract on this. No, well it will be 8 hours then.""

CPB NOC: ""We are CPB.""

IBM: ""We are IBM. No service contract, 8 hours""

CPB NOC: ""Ok, we will wait.""

(I wish my employer had done stuff like this at the time, but they had no backbone. IBM drops off the call and the technician will be there within 8 hours.)

After setting this up someone on the call says, ""Call the server team"". Their manager M (complete moron who once asked if there was  a difference between Windows and Linux) happend to be on call and this is how it went.

CPB Admin: Hey, do you know anything about this blade server?

M: Yes, it was installed a few weeks ago. What is the problem?

CPB Admin: We are not showing a service contract on it. 

M: I haven't gotten around to it yet.

CPB Admin: Ok, thanks for your help. You can drop off now.

(At least everyone else knew M was worthless.)

I head home for some reheated Thanksgiving dinner and meet the IBM tech back at the building close to midnight. So at this point I am getting paid to be a doorman for another tech. Easy money. After replacing the board and firing the blade back up the nics won't team. Software is not included in our contract so I am done. With all the conference calls and such I didn't leave site until 6 the next morning. Beauty of it was that all of it was billed by the hour since the server was not under contract with us. Since it was now Black Friday I had plenty of money for shopping. Server was removed within a month and shipped to another farm. At least my Thanksgiving was profitable if nothing else.

**TL;DR** I spent Thanksgiving working on a server that was not in production and then it was removed a month later.

Aenerb,17,41,1qp3bg,256,"This is my favorite story from my days of being a sysadmin.  

**[Background]** In college I managed to get a job with a company my dad worked for. From the day I started to the day I left I was the only IT guy / sysadmin for this company worldwide. We only had a couple hundred employees in 5 sites across the globe, so while it could be taxing at times it really wasn't that bad. I'd managed to automate most of our processes so I could spend my days answering the occasional trouble ticket, toying with some new functionality I wanted to create, or browsing whatever MMO forum I was playing at the time.  

**[Story]** One morning as I strolled in to the office I was stopped by one of the Admin Girls. She was having trouble receiving emails, but could get to the rest of the internet just fine. The Admin Girls were always the best to work with, so I hopped onto her PC to check it out. Everything looked great; she kept her machine pristine and didn't click things she wasn't supposed to. I told her I'd look into it from my desk and would contact her when I found out what was going on.

Back at my desk I noticed a couple notes from others saying that they, too, were having issues. I tried to log into the mail server and discovered that it was down. Strange, as it was working the night before and hadn't had down time in years. I grabbed my IT toolbag and made the trek down the hall to our server room.

Our server room was very small. It had a couple ""racks"", but these were basically just metal wire shelves that housed our full tower servers. The mail server sat on the bottom shelf, and was typically a giant black hulk of metal. Today, however, it looked _really weird_. It was... dirty. Actual dirt dirty.

Upon closer inspection I discovered that overnight the server became a temporary home for termites. They'd bored up through a crack in the cement floor, moved their way into the mail server, built a mass of dirt clump tunnels, and then fled the scene.

I took a picture of it (unfortunately this was 10 years ago and I cannot find the picture anymore), and sent it to my boss with the subject, ""The mail server is buggy"".

Cust: Nope, just my phone through a filter and the router filtered.

About six months ago I made a major overhaul of my pc hardware. I had bought a new mobo, cpu, ram and kept the same gfx, psu and storage.

When I put it all together it booted all fine from my usb stick and I proceeded with a fresh win7 install. So far, so good.

The next day when I came home from work, I turned it on but didn't bother to turn on the speakers or the screen, and went my way to the bathroom.

I heard 2 short beeps while I was taking a shit. 

I feared the worst, and after wiping and washing my hands and I immediately looked for the mobo manual to find out what the 2 beeps meant (....memory problems).

I held the power button down, turned off the psu, and opened the case. I reseated the ram modules, the gfx card and all the cables just to be safe.

I turned it on, this time with the screen on. All looked good while in the uefi bios, and then it asked me if I wanted to start windows normally or in safe mode... I thought wtf? I did not power it down without shutting it down first yesterday... 

As soon as I selected Start Windows normally, I hear the 2 beeps again. Windows boot up fine and I am wondering why the mobo beeped again. 

As soon as I started typing on google to find out more about my mobo model, I hear it again. 2 short beeps. What the hell???

I put my ear next to the case and wait for the beeps again. When it does, I realize that the beeping is not from the motherboard.

These are some of the conversations that I've had with people over the phone. I sincerely hope you enjoy and get a chuckle out of them.

-----------------

Customer: So I've recently purchased one of your routers and I've installed it on my network, but my internet speed still sucks! I want a full refund!

Me: Okay sir, before we do anything, please let us know your plan's connection speed.

Customer: It's the fastest I tell ya. 5Mb/s Fiber.

**headdesk**

Customer: I've purchased this hard drive only recently and it has failed on me! What kind of crappy products are you guys selling?

Me: Hmmm, may I ask when did you purchase the drive ma'am?

Customer: Oh about April 2012.

***Cue pregnant pause***

Customer: ""I want to discuss the pricing issues with your brand of hard disks....""

Me: ""Sir, we're technical support we only provide technical support over the phone for your pro-""

Customer: ""Blahblahblahblah price is too low blah blah blah blah other brands are cheaper blah blah blah""

*30 minutes later*

""So anyway all I wanted to know was where is your service center in Singapore.""

**Table flip**

Some backstory for this one.

Our call center support number was recently changed (by recent I mean 5 fucking years) to a new number. And for some reason this new number actually belonged to a... how should I say this... Basically it belonged to an existing ISP.

Customer: ""I need you to replace my set-top box.""

Me: ""I'm sorry?""

Customer: ""Sorry isn't going to replace my set-top box, unless your guy is named Sorry.""

Me: ""This isn't [ISP], sir. We're [Redacted].""

Customer: ""Ohhhh.""

So you're still gonna come over and replace my set top box right?""

Me: Could you spell out your email for me Sir?

Customer: Okay. 

*proceeds to speak faster than the speed of light.*

Me: Okay sir I need you to spell it out for me slowly, is that okay?

Customer: Okay.. So A for Alpha, X for Christmas...

Me: What?

Customer: Yeah, X for Christmas.

Customer: Where is the user manual for this product?

Me: It should be in the box...?

Customer: Well genius if it were in the box why would I be calling you?

Me: Did it fall out of the box, sir?

Johnnywycliffe,21,20,1qod8r,91,"I normally consider myself halfway tech competent. I can fix our home printers, set up the router, and fix most issues my folks have.
Recently, I made an ID10t error.

I was asleep in my car, in front of a gym (long story) when the coach walks out and taps on the glass. I wind down the window and she tells me that their laptop isn't working. I grudgingly get out of the car and follow her into the building.

Normally, this gym blares music like it's going out of style. Today it's suspiciously quiet. The coach leads me over to the laptop and tells me she can't get pandora to work. It takes me all of three seconds to figure out that it isn't connected to the Internet. I open the network connection tab-window-thing and ask her to pick the network off the list.

She, of course has no idea. He husband, the head coach does though!
I'm put in touch with him, and he tells me the name of his network. It isn't of the list of networks. Dandy.

He has me go into a room in the back that is a complete mess. There's a router somewhere in here, but since his daughter (the OTHER head coach) was renovating last night, he didn't know where it was exactly. I locate it quickly enough, and it's completely black. The lights are all off. I look around for a power switch or a reset switch, but I don't see anything.

I start throwing ideas around in my head. Caffeine might've helped right about then. Fifteen minutes later, I was about to give up when I tripped over something. A power strip, unplugged. 

At this point I'm face palming. First thing to check is whether or not it's plugged in. It wasn't. I plug everything in and suddenly intranets for everyone.

I don't think I'm going to forget that step anytime soon.

TL:DR; It's called wireless because NO WIRES NEEDED!... Right?",Have you tried plugging it back in?,111
Warlord_Shadow,20,63,1qocb4,251,"This is a story from back when I was studying to become an IT tech.

I still honestly can not tell whether the supervising teacher knew what she was marking, or if they had only learned to recognise what the correct answers to everything were. She could quickly mark things, but ask something that was slightly different and she would struggle.

So this was technically a 'networking' certificate and it came time for me to do some router config (SUPER basic stuff. Port forwarding, some blocking etc)

I read through the instructions and work out pretty quickly that I need to do this on a real router (90% of the course was done inside some very nice pre-made VMs)

I go up to the instructor and ask for the router that I meant to perform the config on and she points to the device sitting in the middle of the computer bench.

I was a little bit puzzled at this, as I believed that that router was the one with some very specific config that all the computers in the room were using.

I question her and she says ""No, I'm sure thats the one you need to use. Hold down the factory reset pin and get to it!""

Now, this day happened to be one where the class was only half full (being the optimist I am), which meant that as I started unplugging things out the back of the router no one started yelling about their internet going down.

Another stupid quirk of this network was that half the desktops ran over wifi by default. SO even if I did actually pull an active user, it was 50/50 that they'd be using wifi anyway.

As I was pulling the final cable and raising my mighty pen to hold the reset pin someone spoke the words I was waiting to hear...

""I think the internet is broken""

That's when I decided that I'd make absolutely sure, and pulled the input cable out of the router.

Sure enough, everyone started complaining.

I then plugged it back in, and surprise, surprise, everything was fine (bar that one guy)

I went back to the 'teacher' and informed her of what she asked me to do. She seemed a little surprised, but didn't put much thought into it before she went back to having her answer sheet and the one she was currently mark side by side on her screen.

I stand there for a little while before she looks up again looking confused as to why I'm still there.

""What do you want? I thought you were doing the router prac?""

""I was, but you asked me to reset this lab's main and only router!?""

""Oh, well maybe it was that one over in the corner you're meant to use then...""

...

Well it would have been a lot easier if she'd pointed to that one to start with...

So a batch of updates comes out and our main 'visuals' person is on vacation. They are high priority and really can't wait for her to get back in a week. I've got some down time so I get given the task. 

Catch is that I need a particular account password which was recently changed. The new one was sent to Visuals who told me on her way out that she forwarded it to me and the managers in case we needed it. But oops she didn't send it to me. 

So I go to the manager on duty to check to see if the email went through to the managers. So she gets into their mailbox and goes to search for it. She puts in ""(name of Visuals) passwords"" and gets nothing.

Fantastic201,39,41,1qo1ad,229,"So I'm still in school for an exciting career as (hopefully) a sysadmin. I do repairs and simple computer stuff on the side for family and friends for free as long as they pay for the part. I've got a friend who is a mechanic and my car recently broke down. I call up my friend (Z), and he comes out and tows me back to his shop. He tells me that my transmission gave out and that even though I'm a friend, it's still going to be costly. I figured as much. We talked for a bit about cost and the amount of time I'd be without a car. He then mentioned something about his computer being weird and asked if I could take a look at it. I said sure, and he hands it to me while he started doing some work for another customer. I booted up and the desktop forever to actually load. As soon as it did, there were pop-ups *everywhere*. I mean, he had been browsing porn and downloading all manner of things for six months on IE with no virus protection and all other manner of protection turned off. No firewall, no updates, nothing. So I went out in the bay to talk to him and told him I could remove all of the viruses and errors but that it would take some time. He said that it was fine and told me to bring it back whenever. So I take the poor thing home and begin. Ten bloatware/crap programs, 64 viruses, and 300 registry errors later, it started running correctly. I could almost hear the thing weeping in joy. So I finished up with the updates and brought it back. He then tells me that he cant get the printer to connect, and he wants to be able to scan all his documents and receipts of work into his computer. No problem. I download drivers and set it up so the files scan directly to his my pictures folder and then made three other folders for him 'Recipts' 'Work Documents' 'Other' so that he could sort them as he wished. Then he tells me he has issues connecting the laptop to his TV so he could watch Netflix and do work. I Connected the thing via HDMI to the TV and then changed the output from duplicate to extend and adjusted the output as such. Everything works beautifully. He's super grateful and tells me he's going to get my car back to me as soon as possible. Skip about a week forward, and he calls me down to his shop to lend him a hand with my car. He's the only guy there, and he said he just needed me to hold a part while he tightened some bolts.
I headed down, and he's on the phone with Volkswagen (my brand of car) about a part that looked off. Volkswagen emails him a schematic of my transmission so he can verify a part before we finish up. He tried to log into to his yahoo mail and it keeps redirecting him to some profile set up. He clicks the 'no thank you' button three times over and it keeps redirecting him. He finally lost it and punched his computer screen and cracked the shit out of it.

Z: Well fuck... Can you replace screens?

Me: Yeah I can.

Z: How much is a new one?

Me: Anywhere from 50$ - 100$

He shuts his laptop lid and hands it to me.

Z: Oh and how long did you work on my laptop before?

Me: Around 5 hours.

Z: Well tell me how much the screen will be, and I'll comp you 5 hours off my cost on your car plus the screen and time to put it in.

mike40033,36,34,1qnp13,149,"I had a long-standing problem with one of my two monitors at work. It would blink on and off sporadically, and sometimes display a shower of flickering green pixels. 

Some of you already know the cause of the problem from this description. Here's how we found out what it was.

It didn't bother me too much - I could still work - however, one day I mentioned it to our computer support guy. No problem, new monitor. Problem persists, but it's reduced. He upgrades the video drivers. Problem persistently persists, so I decide to just live with it.

Scroll forward a year. Time to move desk. Max the Maintenance Man (not his real name) helps shift my PC. Max did all kinds of odd jobs around the company - changing light bulbs, setting up conference booths, cooking barbecue lunches. Max is a hero, we were all sad when he left recently. 

So, my PC is set up, and Max asks ""do you want a new monitor?""

He waves his hand towards a stack of brand-spanking-new monitors scattered on a nearby table. 

""Now's the chance""

So, I say, why not? After all, my monitor is still blinking, with green snow. Max helps me help myself to two new HPs to replace my Samsungs, and I power up. 

It's still snowing. 

The computer guy gets wind of this, and suggests upgrading the video drivers. The catch is, i'd have to log out, and can't really do that until the next day because of a program I was running. 

The next morning, Max comes and says ""maybe it's a cable problem?"" So, he grabs a new video cable, swaps out the old one, and...

Done! A year-long monitor problem is instantly solved!

""See? This pin here is bent""

Lesson learnt: hardware includes cables. 

TL;DR: Max the Maintenance Man saves the day.

Nulagrithom,18,14,1qnlst,71,"Hello TFTS! First time poster here. 

**Disclaimer: This isn't _particularly_ entertaining, and it turned in to a long read. I just need to let this out somewhere. You can get the gist of it from the phone call. To understand the frustration, read on.**

Today is the day. Today is the day that something so ridiculous has occurred, the only sane reaction is to either drink it away or post it on TFTS. I have another hour and half before I can do the former, so here goes. I'm not really sure where to begin... Let's start with the strange habits of _h. Userus_. Feel free to read the following in a documentary-style narration:

---

_The User is a peculiar creature. Some users are very attached to their machines, so much so that when they temporarily move to another desk, they feel a need to bring their entire workstation, worn out mouse and all, with them. The User also sometimes feels a need to bring various knickknacks and treasures on their brief journey. One could surmise these oddities are used to remind them of their home._

---

We've been playing musical chairs with a certain cubical. Through some convoluted reasoning that has yet to be made clear to me, it's necessary to change cubes when changing 'jobs', even if that change comes in the middle of the day. A worker may spend half a day in the temporary cube, then return to their desk for the remainder of the day. This usually happens when responsibilities are shifting, and other moves are taking place.

I've switched the workstation in that cube five times over a span of 3 months. The first time I didn't question it. The second time I didn't question it either. The third time, I asked why we were moving things around. I received no answer. The fourth time I got annoyed with the constant back-and-forth. I got a little pissed in fact, and people knew it. This didn't stop them from asking me to rearrange half the equipment just as I'd finished setting everything up. By the fifth time, I'd given up hope of making sense of the arrangement.

But today. Today was ridiculous.

I received a request to switch out the PC in the musical-cube with the PC of an employee who recently left the company so that an adjacent employee could perform the duties of said employee. I was puzzled by this request, and asked what software on the other PC was necessary to perform the duties. I received no answer.

Nope. Not happening this time. I added an RDP shortcut to the user's desktop and informed the user they could remotely access the PC. I received another request, this time with my boss CC'd, to move the computer. We rehashed the situation, again with no explanation of why physically moving the PC was necessary, or what software was needed.

**And now, ladies and gentlemen, the phone call:**

_ring-ring! click--_ This is Null.

`Hey, I'm remoted in to this computer, but it's not working.`

Alright, let me shadow you and take a look. _I punch up the PC for remote assistance._ What's going on? _I hear whispers in the background, which is never a good thing._

`Am I supposed to log in?`

Yes, log in under your username.

`But I thought this was $exemployee's computer?`

Yes, but their account has been disabled. Use your account.

`But how...` _They're cut off by somebody else talking. This conversation is going nowhere without communication from all parties apparently involved._

Let me head over there so we can figure it out.

`Okay.`

---

_I walk across the building. When I arrive, the users scatter. I'm perplexed. Who's going to show me the problem? I mill about aimlessly until the user who was on the phone returns._

""Hey, I'm going to go do $thing. You can go ahead and play around on that,"" _the user gestures towards the computer_ ""and figure it out.""

Umm... I'm not exactly sure what you need. That's her computer right there. _I point to the RDP window._

""Yeah but, isn't like, stuff supposed to come up?""

Huh? What program do you need? Do you need some kind of website?

""I don't know. I thought if we used her account that stuff would come up.""

---

What. I don't... What? It dawned on me then that nobody knew what $exemployee actually _did_ with the computer. They know a thing needs to be done, and figured if they logged on to the computer, the computer would just take care of it!

firestorm_v1,18,27,1qmwbi,129,"Another story from ~~my repressed memory~~my stint of running my own company since my last one was so well received. (Thank you!)

This story is a bit different than the last one in that the company was aware of all their servers and of their small network configuration.  Their ""server room"" was a storage closet that had file cabinets on one side of the room with the two servers sitting under a small desk.  On the desk, they had a monitor and keyboard (with KVM) for the servers with a PIX firewall and a 24 port switch. The PIX serves two VLANs over a trunk to the switch which then segmented off the network between the servers and the workstations.  

The down side was that the switch was old and eventually it gave up the ghost.  What follows is a tale of significant facepalming...

**Phone rings**

    Me: Firestorm_v1 with blahblah networks, how can I help?
    Cu: Our network is down, we can't connect to the server! Please help!
    Me: Ok, lets check a few things, can you get to the Internet?
    Cu: No, I keep getting ""page cannot be displayed""

**walks customer through typical troubleshooting..  Unlike most customers, this person sounds pretty on-the-ball about troubleshooting.**

    Me: Ok, let's take a look at something, can you open your network control panel?
    Cu: It says SomeFancyAdapter is not connected.
    Me: That's odd, can you check another computer?
    Cu: Hmm, this one says the same thing.
    Me: Ok, can you get to the server room?
    Cu: Sure, one sec.

**Customer heads to the server room and opens the door.**

    Me: Ok, you should see a green-ish box with a bunch of wires coming out of it, do you see it?
    Cu: Yes. It has lights on it.
    Me: What color are the lights?
    Cu: It looks like they're all brown.
    Me: Ok, that's definitely not good.  Let's try something. Can you pull the power on the switch,
        count to 10 and then plug it back in?
    Cu: Ok, done.

**Customer describes switch booting**

    Me: Ok, now what are the lights doing?
    Cu: Looks like the lights are still all amber.
    Me: Well crap, it looks like your switch has died.  I have a similar switch in my inventory, but
        I got to go to storage to get it.  I'll be there in one hour to get you all back online.
    Cu: What do we do in the meantime?
    Me: I don't know, your switch connects your computers to the servers and the Internet, without
        it, you are pretty much dead in the water.  I'll get you up as soon as possible, but I have to
        get a replacement switch first.

**Customer is not happy at the prospect of being down for an hour, (understandably).**

    Cu: Is there nothing else I can do?
    Me: Unfortunately, no. The switch is dead and without a replacement, you can't connect.
    Cu:  I can go get another switch from (big retail box location)!  There's one down the road.
    Me: It's unlikely that (big retail box location) has this switch. 
    Cu: Well it's gotta be worth a shot! My users are idle, they need to be working! (panicked voice)
    Me: Your network requires a switch that understands VLAN configurations and when the new 
        switch is installed, it has to be configured for it.  This is a pretty complex process and 
        requires a specific switch type.
    Cu:  Ok, well get here as soon as possible.

As described, I rush from my office to the storage location, pick up a spare Cisco 24 port switch and hightail it to the customer's site. I greet Cu at the door and he looks like he's seen a ghost. I walk into the server room with the new switch in tow and see that the old switch had been completely disconnected.  All of the patch cables are in a mess on the tabletop where the switch was sitting and it's almost impossible to tell which from what.  I also noticed a brand new Linksys router sitting proudly on the top of the stack, with the PIX right under it.

    Me: What is this doing here?
    Cu: After I spoke with you, I called up my friend and asked him to help.  He came over and bought
       this for me. He said that all I had to do was plug it in and things would start working.
    Me: This is a router, this is not going to work.  
    Cu: Well, I thought it would work and so did he, ends up he just made things worse.  A switch is
        just a switch, right?
    Me: /facepalm.

After explaining to him what the difference between a managed switch and a linksys router was and after configuring the new switch with the proper VLAN information, he was back up and working again and some color had been restored to his face. I told him that if he finds a problem, follow my instructions to the letter and do not accept help from anyone but me.   I also told him to take that Linksys back to where he got it and get a refund as the PIX was working properly.

Thankfully, after this incident, I never had to worry about this customer doing any shady stuff again. I guess he just needed to trust me to do my job.  BTW, that'll be $300 for the switch, labor, and emergency priority.

TL;DR, This is not the switch you are looking for.... ","Customers don't make good network architects, not even in emergencies",156

                                    How to Win PFYs and Terrify End-Users

- - - - -

Two weeks had passed since the tablets went out to the students, and sure enough, one student - one clever, clever kid - had figured out how to get a local admin account on the devices with a WinPE flash drive with NTPWEdit on it.

Now, normally, we wouldn't be able to see that he was using it without a lot of work, and since we'd since run a script with net user ACCOUNT_NAME /active:no every two hours on every single tablet via psexec @assetlist.txt due to the imaging company screwing up anyways, the rest of the company didn't think that the damage was there. I was a paranoid bastard, though, and I set up an alert in Computrace. The tablets would call in every two hours and report a bunch of stuff, like their IP address, software installed, et cetera. My alert would text-message me if anyone logged in using a non-domain account when the device called home.

Fortunately, the idiot kid used it to make himself another local admin account, this one with his Internet handle as the user name, which tripped the alarm and texted me when it called home.

Apparently, subtlety wasn't his strong suit.

The next morning - a Friday - I had the tech who goes to the campus confiscate his tablet. He called me with the kid in the IT room, just for me to explain. Being that I was on a bit of a DBZA kick, I decided to talk over the phone using Mr. Popo's voice.

""We know what you did. I hope you enjoyed it.""

""Um... can I have my tablet back?""

""Monday.""

""... uh, am I in trouble?""

""You'll find out on Monday.""

""Are you going to contact my parents?""

""You'll know by Monday.""

The tech booted the kid out of his office at that, and after a quick discussion with me about the kid (parents were wealthy as can be, kid was a gamer with an iPhone and time and money to burn, got a full ride to a certain ultraconservative Texas college for engineering, et cetera), he hung up the phone. I pulled out the PDF of the school handbook, and after perusing it, confirmed what I needed, and repeated the process with some paperwork I had archived.

Monday afternoon rolled around, and sure enough, the kid's parents were sitting in the principal's office with him and the campus tech. I knocked discreetly on the door after a few minutes and apologized to the principal for being late.

""I don't think I know you. You're not the campus tech. Who are you?"" the kid asked, with far less fear in his voice than one would expect. I guess he figured that his dad's money and status (exec in a certain computer company) would protect him.

""I'm the senior network administrator,"" I replied, sitting down and smoothing my slacks.

""Forgive me,"" his father announced. ""I don't see why we need to be here. So he got caught misusing a computer. What's the big deal? Just take it away from him for a while.""

I shook my head. ""Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Were it that easy, we'd just take the tablet away and refund your insurance check. However, there's several things that we need to factor in to this. First off, your son was using illicitly obtained administrative access to create backdoor accounts on the tablet in question. Secondly, we have heard from various students that he decided to spread this method around and show other kids how to do it.""

""Wait, what?""

""Quite. And when we called him on it, he asked us if he was in trouble, and if we were going to contact you. I don't think he was sorry about it, more like sorry he got caught.""

At this point, his parents were glaring at him, but not seriously, and he leaned back in his chair, confident that any punishment would be something light.

""So at this point,"" I continued, ""there's precious few things we can do. We would LIKE it if your son put an apology in writing to us for this, but that's really a formality at this point. Given the severity of what he did, immediate expulsion, with failing grades in every subject, is the punishment we have in mind for him.""

Their faces went slack, his jaw dropped, and even the principal looked over at me with an arched eyebrow. However, the campus tech nodded, and the principal kept quiet. 

The principal had an inkling. The campus tech... well, he KNEW what I had in mind, and he was impressed.

""EXPULSION? You can't be serious!""

""Oh, but I am serious. And don't call me Shirley."" The joke was ill-received, so I continued on. ""There's an acceptable user policy. It's in the code of behavior in the student handbook that he signed off on when he started the year. You signed off on it too, since he's a minor. You all signed the forms AGAIN when we gave him his tablet. It states in there that an offense of this severity is punishable by means up to and including expulsion. Quite frankly, given how confident your son made these kids with his methods of getting administrative access, an example needs to be made.""

I turned to the kid. ""And don't forget what this means. You get expelled, your free ride to STATE_COLLEGE goes away as well. I'm sure that you could get in by other means - though why you'd go there in the first place, I haven't the foggiest - but a full year of failing marks is kind of an eye-raiser to even the most permissive college, and if they see 'expelled for attempting to defeat computer security measures' on your transcript... well, I don't think that it would end well.""

The hyperventilating started, and I leaned back in my chair, letting it sink into everyone's heads that I well and truly hold a banhammer over some kid's future, and crossing me while it was over his head... well, it wouldn't end well at all, since I appeared to have the campus tech and principal on my side.

""YOU CAN'T - ""

""Of course,"" I smoothly said, cutting the red-faced father off before he could reply, ""we may have an alternate solution that's far more preferable. Back in my day, kids that were as... creative-minded... as he were regarded as possibly having a future in the information technology field. In fact, the administration would even give such kids extra training and knowledge, in hopes that they would use their skills for good. As a matter of fact, that's what my high school did for me when I did something far worse than what your son did. Given the level of skill required to do what he did, I'm certain that we could find a place for him in our new technology internship program here for the rest of the term, if not the year.""

The hyperventilating slowed, and the father looked pensive, while the mother was glaring daggers at the kid.

""Of course, your son would have to realize that being granted his privileges again would come with a price. He will leave all of his cellphones at the office in the morning, and the only computers he's allowed to use on school grounds will be our provided devices. Any further attempts to circumvent security or perform malicious acts - or even ones that we perceive as malicious against our systems and networks - will result in immediate, uncontestable expulsion."" I glared at the kid, throwing him a lifeline. ""Is that eminently clear?""

He nodded assent, and his father agreed.

""Be in the campus tech's office tomorrow morning, 7:30 AM."" I rose, shook the father's and mother's hands, and walked out with the campus tech.

""I can't believe you pulled that off,"" he said, walking beside me. ""I expected them to go ballistic.""

""Quite frankly, so did I,"" I replied, checking around the corner to make sure we weren't being followed. Once we were back in his office with the door shut, I sat down in the comfy chair and kicked my feet up. 

""So, any plans for your new PFY?"" he said, raising his Mountain Dew in a salute.

""Oh, we can't trust him with anything, especially local admin. He's going to be doing a LOT of triaging, diagnostics, and gruntwork, perhaps some reimaging. Good, honest tier 1 helldesk work. In fact, I think I'm going to make his cellphone our out-of-hours contact for any non-server-related stuff for the campuses, with an expected acknowledgement time of 15 minutes to respond to the ticket.""

Our maniacal cackles rang out through the office, and he clinked his Dew bottle against my Doppleganger.

lnx64,19,19,1qmkyh,179,"This is more of a sad story to me than something funny.  It was actually the 2nd month ever being in a call center.

Ok, so I used to work for an ISP some time ago, that will remain nameless, and I got this call at around 10pm at night.  It was for the ISP's firewall software, as the customer (a mother), set it up, and well, blocked everything..  She didn't understand the reasoning for a white list, and that just blocking everything would well, block everything.  She called in, mad at me that we don't make it easier.  I tried to calm her down, and was seemingly able to.

After probing the customer and empathizing, I realized what she had done, and proceeded to switch the firewall software onto a different setting, that doesn't block all.  Then she did the unthinkable.

""My stupid daughter probably did this"", she told me, after she just told me she was the one who turned on the block all (white list) function.  I promptly ignored her, because I can't really obviously involve myself in that.  That was about to change.

She puts her daughter on the phone, who I should mention, is in tears, and is verbally getting yelled at by the mother (from what I am hearing on the phone).  At this point, I'm freaking out, because I was new, I wasn't trained well enough for this..  My training was 3 weeks, and that was it.

I just do what I can, and yes I got written up for this.  I stop following my script that the computer tells me I need to follow, and talk to this daughter as a human, I tell her it's ok, I'm here to help, and we will get the internet rolling again in no time at all.  I managed to calm her down, the mother finally walked off somewhere, and I was able to then get her full attention, as I imaged in my head what screens she's seeing (I kinda have a photographic memory and remember most operating systems visually, including the firewall software our ISP issued).  Within 10 minutes, it was going again.  Turned out the mother even removed our preset white list (which was quite comprehensive actually), and we had to turn off the firewall, and redownload our software.

Think it's over?  Mother came back on the phone.

At this point, I'm still not going by script anymore.  I didn't want to put the blame on the already angry mother, besides, it's unprofessional.  So I instead just told her that there was a ""corrupted"" white list, and we got it fixed, and it's working just fine now.  She looks, sees internet, is happy.  Then she messes with the white list again, while on the phone with me.

""Are you sure you want to erase the contents of the white list?""  she mutters.  ""Yes"" she says..  I face palm so hard I swear the entire floor heard it, even the customer, who was on mute.  ""The internet, it broke again!  What did YOU do!??"" she yells at to me.

""Miss, clearing out the white list prevents any site from loading.""  I tell her..
""What?  I don't understand, you did this somehow!  I want your supervisor!"" she yells.

""Certainly."" I say.

Xferred the call to level 2 support, told them over IM the entire case notes I was logging...

""Her again?"" said level 2 support.  Turns out this happens all the time with this lady.

flatmop,11,10,1qmkcu,60,"Today I tried to log into a workstation (the last one that was free in the room), only to find that some chump had yanked the Ethernet cable out and snapped the springy plastic tab that held the connector in place such that it would no longer stay in place. I came back with a replacement I found conveniently lying on the floor in the next room, but I couldn't quite reach the dado trunking from where I was sitting, so I asked the guy at the next desk to plug it in for me. A simple enough request, right?

At first I thought maybe he was mocking my request or trying to be difficult as he jammed the end of the Ethernet cable repeatedly, flipping it over a couple of times like that would make a difference. But no, this was an earnest attempt to plug it in. 

""No, that's RS232..."" I trailed off in pure disbelief. He was trying to plug it into a DB9-style serial port connector. I don't even... I mean, *it's not even vaguely the right size or shape!* I directed him to the adjacent network port on the dado trunking, but that wasn't the end of it. He still had to unplug the busted cable from before, but instead of squeezing the springy tab thing, he tried to yank it out the socket in the same way that had probably broken the last cable. 

""Yeah, you need to press on the plastic bit to release the cable."" I instructed. Too vague! Instead, he starts pressing on the plastic surrounding the sockets, not  on the connector itself.

""Underneath. Great... thanks."" 

Seriously though, how does someone get that far through life and end up working in a technical job without ever having had to plug in an Ethernet cable, and much less without having managed to solve one of those shape-sorting toys you played with as a baby. That's  literally all there is to it, sorting shapes! Unbelievable...

Given that my other suggestions (one of which, was a fully functioning script to use as an example) were apparently too complicated, I offered to help set up an SSH key pair to bypass the login prompt.  Along with step by step instructions for creating the keys, this is what I told them:
&gt;To get an SSH key pair set up, we’ll need a pair generated by the client you’ll be using.  Once that’s done, you’ll keep the private key that was generated for your use, and upload just the public key to your account on the sftp server.  Let me know when that’s done, and I’ll install it on the server.

HypotheticalRicotta,22,19,1qm4ol,91,"I manage the database at a private highschool, and recently we've moved all of our student records into a new database system. The new system is easier to use than the last one, but the front office is very resistant to change.

The first week of the year I explain to the front office how to track attendance, and they thought it was amazing. They used to have to enter attention codes for every student. The new application only requires them to enter the students tardy or absent: everyone else is assumed present. There was a hiccup two days later with the attendance codes, but I quickly fixed everything to their liking, and was under the impression that everything was going smoothly.

Yesterday on the way home from work I got an email from our UPS that we went on battery power and 1 second later went back on to grid power. No big deal, we have a generator and it didn't even kick on. This happens all the time. A few minutes later I got a call from one of my users saying they had no network. He was cool with walking down the hall to the switch closet and he quickly found the switch had not kicked back on. Powered up, good to go.

First thing this morning I go over to that building and check everything out. As I am walking down the hall I hear an UPS beeping, calling out to me, ""change my battery, change my battery"" with the incessant beeping I have come to know and love.

Trouble was, I couldn't tell exactly where it was coming from... It wasn't the one in the switch closet. Our buildings are rectangles with a hall on the inner perimeter and the acoustics are crazy. A conversation at one corner of the hall can be heard with ease at the opposite corner.

So I stood in the hallway and waited, 2 minutes beep, beep, beep: can't tell where. I enlist the help of our facility manager who is making his morning rounds. BUT he tells me he lost most of his hearing long, long ago in a previous job.

2 minutes later; beep, beep, beep so tantalizingly close, but still cannot tell which direction. I move down the hall and attempt to gain the help of one of our engineers (construction, not IT) but he is unable to hear it and has work to do.

It went on like this for about 20 minutes until I was re-positioning for the 4th or 5th time and the facility manager found me in the hall listening and said, ""Oh, that was probably the microwave. Someone had left their food in it and it was beeping. I just stopped it""

codeusasoft,38,36,1qlnil,187,"I figured I'd go ahead and share the tale of what occurred tonight.

I have a computer repair and build service I do for spare change, its picked over up a lot this last year so I had to implement the policy to all customers not to call me after 9:30pm. When my pants come off the last thing I want to do is help you with your problems. But as my clock struck 9:31pm and my pants are half way off my phone begins to ring.




I reluctantly pickup and I'm greeted with a barrage of incoherent nonsense. The client is Ms.G; she had dropped her computer off a few days prior. Her computer OS was so boggled down with malware, spyware and bloatware that if it were a person I would have shot on principle. She requested I upgrade her computer to Windows 8 (from 7) because she was told it make it faster; she had Windows 7 32x installed and her cpu supported 64x so I informed her that I'd have to reformat her drive completely in order to install Windows 8 (to upgrade her to the x64 version). She said this was okay and I started to work.



45 minutes later and I'm done. I call her to ask if she needs any programs specifically and she informs me she needs Microsoft Word, Excel &amp; etc etc. I let her know she would have to purchase the Microsoft Suite for those applications as they aren't included with Windows 8 and its at this point I can hear her getting upset. So I reassure her I'll take care of it and install Libreoffice. She comes and picks up her machine and all was well.


**Was.**


So once I finally get her to calm down she tells me whatever Chinese program I installed won't open her excel document. At this point I'm baffled, probably because my pants are off and my hot pocket was beeping in the microwave. She demands I come over and fix it for her as she can't get her work done. Usually this be were I said come by tomorrow and tough luck, but she sounded as if she was about to burst out crying and I hate feeling bad. So I hop in the car and drive 30 minutes to her house and knock on the door. She takes me to her office and on the screen is Calc, nothing out of the ordinary. She again goes on a tirade asking me why I'm supporting Chinese companies and not Microsoft who hires U.S. employes and ask if I'm a communist. I have no earthly idea why she assumes Calc was made by the Chinese and have to explain to her its a free open source office suite made by people all over the world including the United States and ask her just to show me the issue she is having.

So she goes to her email and clicks an attachment and Firefox prompts her to Open With or Save, she chooses Open With and while it does open, Calc has made it ""Read Only"" as its a temporary file thus it can't be edited. She turns to look at me with a thousand yard stare as if i am a moron. I tell her to re-click the attachment, click save and choose the green arrow and open it. Like magic it works and to prove I'm surely no communist I charged her for a full hour.

tl;dr: Temporary files are evil and Libreoffice is Chinese.

Background: Our products are pretty simple. Once set up, the student simply logs in and takes the test, or whatever. The teacher doesn't have to go in and fiddle with stuff. They just watch their students to make sure they don't cheat, and pull up the results afterward. 

Around the time of this chat, we had just done a face-lift to our site. Only the Login Page, and the Home Page were changed. Even then, nothing changed functionally or even organizationally.

distgenius,3,4,1ql6t5,40,"We've all heard the stories.  Pleasant interactions with users when providing support happen, my cousin's friend's mother's co-worker's niece had someone call in and they were civil and helpful and very thankful that tech support resolved their problem as soon as they could, even though it wasn't right away.

Then one day, you catch a glimpse yourself.  Maybe the stories are true...

**Background**

I work for a company that produces EMR software for the mental health world (both the records and for managing their business).  We also sell a package that would be used for ""managing care"", which is more for the insurance company side of things.  The two worlds intersect a lot, and when I hired about two years ago my only experience with mental health was providing moral support for my wife while she attended graduate school for counseling psychology.  Now, I know a lot more than I expected, and have a load of stories that I could share.

I spend 4 days a week providing support directly to end-users for both software packages, as well as creating reports, doing one-off data pulls, and also doing QA on updates and upgrades.  The fifth day is my chance to catch up on whatever I haven't been able to focus enough time on without having to be there on the phones or manning the ticket system.

About a month ago, we had rolled out a pretty hefty upgrade to one of our customer sites, which merged two of our applications into one web app.  They are one of the few stragglers that were on the older version, and the transition went as smoothly as we could have hoped, considering end users didn't want to test, didn't pay attention in training, and they had a metric arse-ton of customizations that we had to bring into the new ""base"" system. Of course, the same things they said worked in the test environment immediately broke on day one and when we went back into the test system, sure enough they didn't work there either.  The last month has been more hectic than normal, and filled with cases of end users completely forgetting their own internal policies and processes but sure that the ""upgrade"" broke something.  I'll fully admit that the upgrade could have used more time for testing, and wish that we could have caught more of the problems internally, but I can't throw too many stones at my co-workers.  It seems like nobody can manage to ""break"" an application quite like an end-user.  Especially the ones who still miss the days of paper forms.

**Today**

I''m on site, in the tech office.  The day was drawing to a close.  A half hour before I get to punch out and go home, a user calls.  We'll call her U, for unicorn, because I'm still not sure she really exists. The other players are DG (me), and M, the customer's tech support manager.  M answered the call, because the other techs were in the middle of something.

U: So I know I talked with with you earlier and you put a ticket in, but I wanted to check on it because I hadn't heard anything.  I'm concerned that my staff might be doing something wrong.

M: Let me check with the engineer, and see if they've had a chance to work on your ticket.

M mutes the phone, and asks about the status.  I explain that I haven't had a chance to dig into it just yet, but something about the ticket information didn't mesh- the words all meant something our system, but the combination didn't add up- so it would be great if we could clarify the problem.  Un-mute phone.

M: So our engineer is looking for some clarification, and I think I was the one who created your ticket the last time you called.  I must have not taken good enough notes, do you mind explaining it again?

At this point I'm nervous- M is great as a manager, but I'd feel more comfortable with one of the L1s or L2s.  They're more familiar with the different shadowing systems they use, depending on the user's setup, and they're also at least passingly familiar with our software.  In the majority of the calls we handle, it is much more effective to shadow them than to have them explain their steps out loud.

U: Sure, not a problem.  We're finding that some contracts have rules with expiration dates well after the end date of the contract...

And U goes on, to explain in great detail, that she's pretty sure there was a validation that stopped people from entering in things like this, and she's not sure why it exists but there definitely *are* contracts with these anomalies.  

DG: Just to be clear, are you concerned that processes that depend on the contract are attaching to these rules for dates outside the contract itself?

U: No, I know that isn't happening, I'm just concerned that my staff are entering in invalid information.

DG: Do you mind if I do some digging and call you back before the end of the day?

U agrees, M thanks me for taking the time out at the end of the day to dig into something new, and off I go.   The tech side is pretty basic- the validations are working fine for rule entry, but we're missing one on the actual contract dates.  There is nothing to prevent a user from changing the contract end date to one before a contract rule ends, which doesn't affect the parts that depend on the rules because the first thing those do is check that an active contract exists for the date in question. To top it off, it wasn't even one of her staff that had changed the end of the contract, it was someone in the billing department- they probably saw a contract that didn't end on the fiscal year end and made a bad assumption.  Fifteen minutes of digging, no big deal, found my answer.  I signal to M that it is time.

M calls U back, and we relay our findings.  

U: Thank you so much!  I'll let my staff know about that part, and I'm sorry to have taken up your time with this.  I was just concerned that we were doing something wrong on our end!  I'll fix the end date on the contract myself.

M smiles, the happy smile of someone managing a support department that is continually underwater in a sea of tickets.  I sit back in my chair in amazement.  I...actually...caught a glimpse of the unicorn.  I'm still not completely sure, of course, but the stories don't seem quite so crazy anymore.

Gambatte,27,8,1qkzr6,75,"This happened several years ago: I was renting a room from a friend. He only had a laptop at the time and I had my full blown gaming PC. Said friend asks if he can use my desktop while I'm away on a work trip (about three months). Sure, I'm not going to be there, so go for it.

Qualifiers: this friend has done all of the same electrical and computer courses as I have, plus is into computer gaming, so I'm fairly confident in his ability to sort things out if something should go wrong. Plus, all he's going to be doing is playing WoW; it's pretty much the only PC game he played at the time.

Queue: Two months later; I get an email from the flatmate (FM):

&gt; FM: Hey man, I was using your PC and it shut down randomly. I've had to go back to using my laptop.

&gt; ME: Okay, that's weird... Don't use it any more and I'll look into it when I get back.

So... about six weeks later, I get home; looking forward to relaxing by maybe killing some internet dragons for geek cool points *(edit: by geek cool points, I mean guild DKP; the system by which we determined loot distribution. Achievement points weren't added to WoW until several years later).*

First thing I do is turn it on, let it run and after about twenty minutes, it shuts down. Okay, something's not right. I try turning it back on, it powers up and I get back into Windows. About this time I notice that there's a CD in the drive, so I eject it... and promptly drop the thing, because it's far too hot to actually hold.

Okay, this might be a problem... Shut down gracefully this time, pull the computer, crack the case, dust everything down (by no means the worst dust creatures I had encountered), try again... No joy. I tried some monster overclocking heatsinks *(note: PC was not actually overclocked)*, but eventually I gave up and just dropped the cash on a new PSU, motherboard, CPU, RAM and video card (because I couldn't determine the exact source of the heat, and what the hell, I was upgrading anyway).

As I'm putting the new hardware in, my flatmate proceeds to tell me this gem:

&gt; FM: I was raid leading Onyxia, and your computer kept shutting down every ten minutes. It was really annoying - I thought I was going to get kicked and miss out on the loot!

&gt; ME: So when I emailed you to say ""Don't use my computer, I'll fix it when I get there in a couple of weeks"", you decided to just keep on using it?

&gt; FM: Well, it works much better than my laptop!

TheArchPriest,6,7,1qkkw2,47,"Just a quick insight; I had been working in IT for two year doing pretty much everything at a shitty outsource IT company. Websites *Check*, Computer Setups *Check*, Helpdesk *check*, Server Setups *Check*, Black Magic *Check*, list go on and seems not to matter if I'd say I am not comfortable with doing this (Being thrown in the deep end repairing or updating sensitive systems on my own without any insight, background or even backups on the rare shitty occasion). I found for whatever reason I was sin-binned to pretty much one client after awhile. I didn't really care about it, as I liked working there, well most of the time.

This is a story about **Old S**, she is meant to be technical support for the ERP system that the company runs, she does an ok job but try to get he to investigate anything and she flips a lid. 
Most of the time we can take what she says with grain of salt however because it is the ERP system we are obligated to do research and she knows it.

So early morning I am sitting at my desk and hear a disappointing *sigh* and shuffled footsteps coming towards my office the signature of another episode with **Old S**.

**Old S :** TheArchPriest the network is not working and I am not able to do my report in the ERP system.

I find this odd as I have active SSH Session and Emails coming in, not to mention reddit.

**Me :** Are you sure it is not an ERP issue Old S?

**Old S :** No it is IT my Connection keeps dropping and nothing shows up in results when I run the report.

While this has got my slightly curious that it *could* be IT I'm still not there.

**Me :** Is anyone else having the same issue?

I know this annoys her, as there is a *very* large gap in age she sees me as someone trying to undermine her, not as someone trying to solve the issue. 

**Old S :** Well I haven't checked. It is happening to me though and I *know* it is an IT issue.

**Me :** Ok Old S we don't know for 100% yet why don't you show me what is happening?

So we walk around to her desk and she runs through the report and sure enough nothing shows up just an empty box. May as well I have no clue what *IS* meant to show up as this is her job not mine and that we have support from the ERP company to deal with ERP issues that she refuses to use ( Partly because I think she doesn't want someone else validating that she is bad ).

**Old S:** See told you IT issue.

**Me :** Slow down there Old S, we still don't know yet can you please go run this report one someone else's system

She looks at me starring blankly trying to convey *But I just showed you it was an IT issue*

**Me :** We have to be sure and make sure it is not a wider issue

Old S reluctantly does what I ask as she know I will not help her any more if she doesn't comply. I go back to my office and check a couple of things on my end to do with servers and the network and come up bust. There is nothing that could be causing her issue.

10 minutes latter I hear the *sigh* and the disappointing *sigh* and shuffled footsteps towards my door.

**Old S** It works for service but not for me I checked again It has to be a network issue TheArchPriest

Now to me this is just plain odd and to most technical people I would presume it would point to her system, her or her ERP account. At this point I am betting on her. So I ask her strait up.

**Me :** Are you sure you are doing it correctly?

This makes her flustered, in her eyes I have clearly undermined her authority and all the years she has with the system and the company.

**Old S :** TheArchPriest **it is IT!**

**Me :** Well I am unable to find any issues on the server end. So either you *could* be doing something incorrect by accident or it might be your ERP account

**Old S:** No it is not my account as my account always works.

**Me :** Well we might have to raise a ticket with ERP as I don't know what else we can do.

**Old S:** No we do not need  to do that.

Now I am annoyed. This happens a lot with Old S, we get to a stalemate where she has come to me for help but doesn't want to listen. So I be sneaky.

**Me :** Well there is one more thing I can try go back to your office and I will meet you there so we can test it.

**Old S**: Good

Old S walk off and I just sit there for a good 5 minutes, then make my way to her office.

**Me :** So Old S I have made some changes on the server end can we please walk through the process very slowly as I need to see how everything responds and at the same time tell me what you are doing.

She seems pleased that I have taken *responsibility* for the issue and complies. She goes through all the way to a point there she is putting in start and end date ranges for the report to run in and I notice that she has swapped the dates around. However for some reason there is no validation and the ERP system just lets you carry through.

**Me :** Old S should those date be around the other way?

**Old S:** What date, no I told yo....

It suddenly hits her after wasting 2 hours I finally get to see the look of defeat on her face. She swaps the date ranges around and the report runs as intended.

I just look at Old S and wish her a good day.",It is definitely an IT Issue,54
Arizth,83,93,1qkf2s,366,"Heyo, TFTS. This one is about as short and quick and subtle as a manatee in a little black dress flailing about a china shop.

A) Is actually malfunctioning

2) Needs supplies, and be able to insert said supplies if need be.

Me: Good afternoon, support.

ND: My fax machine isn't working. It needs a toner.

Me: OK, and you are sure it's the fax machine? Not the printer?

ND: Yes I'm sure! I had one of the maintenance guys here and he said it need a toner! (sic)

Me: ...Right, ok. Please take a look at the screen of the machine, and tell me what it says.

ND: It says sleep. It not makin copies, for like two days now. It need a toner! (sic)

Me: Right, I don't think that's the problem, then. If it was low on toner, the screen would display ""Toner low"". What issue have you been seeing when making copies? Are they very faint, or is the feeder tray not taking input?

ND: Man I don know! I'm not a technician! Just come up here and fix it!

We go back and forth like this a few times, each time with me using smaller words to describe the input tray, until I sigh in disgust and agree to come up. Surprise surprise, it doesn't need toner. The nurse was putting documents in face up, and the scanner would only work if the documents were face down. I set about trying to explain this, but she cuts me off with:

ND: You fixed it already? See, if you weren't arguing and just came up earlier, it would be workin so much faster! (sic)

Me: /disgustedsigh

I turn to walk away, and see out of the corner of my eye a orange light. turn my head, and there sits the printer, piteously flashing it's LEDs to let it's neglectful masters know that it was out of both toner AND paper. I shook my head in disgust, got a toner and ream of paper, and fed the printer. It whirred it's thanks, it's LED burning an ecstatic green.

SkraeNocturne,6,18,1qkd58,91,"Yesterday, I had a user say that her computer would not boot.  I head down, sure enough, it won't boot and there is a lovely noise coming from the hard drive at poweron (long low pitch buzz, short high pitch buzz, in music we would call them slurred notes.  This repeats 5 times).  Normal boot says that there is no boot media available.  One time boot menu says there is no hard drive (remember the noise?).

I check the cable connections, they're good.  I try different cables.  Still nothing.  I even try pulling the hard drive to see if it can be seen by another computer.  Nada.  Even though I know it's hopeless, I fire up SpinRite.  It sees the drive!  But it refuses to run even at Level 1 (typically, the only hard drive problems that SpinRite can't fix given enough time are mechanical).  I don't have time to call due to other stuff happening, so it gets put off till today.

I've found that filing a ticket or chat support usually resolves my issues quicker than calling when dealing with vendors/service providers, so I opt for Hell's chat feature.

At this point, I realize that I am acting like that guy who thinks he knows better than the technician who does this for a living, and so I go ahead and run it.  Aside from not having a hard drive, no issue, and I let her know.  It is at this point, I start to feel justified (although, I still feel bad about it since I get it all day long) for being ""that guy:""  Remember how I said that I told her that the diagnostic says there is no hard drive.?  After hearing that the tests came back clean, she says:  ""Since we already tested the system hardware and it is working as designed. This is considered as a software issue.  I suggest a system restore.""

Thankfully, after reminding her that the diagnostic said there was no hard drive, she was able to authorize a new hard drive to be sent out.

Me: Your laptop screen is cracked.

EM: Cracked? What do you mean cracked?

Me: The screen is broken, thats why it looks like that.  We can send the laptop out to our service center for an estimate, but it usually costs a couple hundred dollars, so it probably isn't worth it (it was a cheap laptop).

EM: I just purchased this like 3 months ago!

Me: Yes, I know. You didn't purchase an extended warranty, and the manufactuer will not cover physical or accidental damage.

EM: I didn't do anything to it!

Me: I'm not saying you did anything, but something caused the screen to crack like this.

EM: I woke up in the morning and turned it on and now it looks like this.

Me: Again, I'm not trying to say you did or didn't do anything to the laptop, but it is physically damaged. I can't explain how it happened for you, I don't know how it happened. Your laptop screen is cracked. 

EM: I live alone! There is no way it could have been damaged! I was using it last night! It isn't physically damaged, it just broke on it's own.

Me: It is cracked in the middle of the screen. You can see where something hit it. (I point to the screen). 

This goes on in circles. for another 20 min. I can't blame the guy too much, I would be a little upset if my lcd was cracked, but fuck man, do you argue for 15 minutes with the guy who replaces your windshield and expect him to know how it broke? It took so fucking long to get the message across, and this guy was an asshole. Eventually I told EM I would be back and just grabbed a manager. The manager talked him into purchasing an extended warranty on a new laptop, and if he did that, he would give him a FREE laptop. (same model). EM left with a free laptop with a warranty he paid $100 for, and he complained about paying for the warranty all the way out the door.  

This wasn't the first or last time I would deal with a pissed off customer.  At we wear clip on ties, it was usually 1 asshole per 8 hour shift.  Your work schedule says your shift ends at 10, but it was really over whenever the manager released you. 


TLDR:  elderly man comes in after we are ""closed"" and  argues with me for 30 minutes as I try to explain his lcd is cracked. Manager takes over and gives the guy whatever the hell he wants because  the company caters to assholes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Greetings, fellow tech support soldiers! 88 here with another tale of that most blessed of lists, the Black List. For those not in the know, one of my previous positions had this idea implemented. At this time, my boss was an awesome guy, and he'd listened to my idea of The Black List, had me get the numbers together, and pitched it successfully to the C_O level. The Black List was a set of people who would receive absolutely no technical support whatsoever. This was communicated to their bosses and was not lifted until the supervisor had assured us (with proof) that the user in question had been reprimanded and instructed in better communication.

This would end up being my defining incident in the time I spent at FirstAid. It came on the heels of a very bad professional incident in our department, but in my personal life things were going great. I was dating Heavylegs, and happy as could be. Of course, we all know what happens in IT when things are going along smoothly and happily.

It ends.

It started with a massive cock-up by a Level 3 engineer that, to this day, I maintain was not at all an accident. L3 was on his way out, and had decided to screw over everyone at the company. Of course, he did this in ways that most users wouldn't know or care about. Group Policy edits were made to completely remove the data limit in Outlook for storage. File servers and networked file storage had their access rights either cleared, preventing access and requiring repair, or cleaned such that anyone could access anything.

Did I mention that FirstAid was a medical facility with several dozen clients of medium or larger size? This was a major problem. Had we not been on the ball and, in fact, on the lookout for L3 to pull this, we'd have been seriously hosed. As it stood, we barely managed to fix things overnight before the next shift. 

We missed something.

Remember that meat-grinder department I so do love telling stories about? We met [my erstwhile companion](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1l9auo/the_black_list_broken_hearts/) there, as well as dealt with [a not so small problem](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1lqild/the_black_list_alpha_counter/) there. This department was, of course, led by one person, and that one person reported to the C_O level. We shall call her Anna.

When Anna decided to come in for work early on Day 1 of what would become War, she decided to start her daily routine of getting into everyone's business by making her way to the shared network drives and seeing what she could find. Depending on the data that she accessed, she could have been fired and sued, or even arrested.

So, of course, she decides to look for a certain legendary file. What does she find, there on that network share? A copy of the Black List. Our CIO required a digital copy of the black folder that Awesome Boss kept, and it was a simple spreadsheet of names, departments, and dates of submission for the B&amp;hammer. The CIO did not, sadly, keep this file somewhere relatively obscure.

Yes. Anna was able to get into IT\BLACKLIST\ with no problems. She made a copy of this file on her desktop and decided that it was time her people got removed from the list. As she scanned her department, she noticed that Heavylegs was now freshly in the clear; she had just been removed from the list the previous week, and we had celebrated that fact with... well, I'll tell you when you get older, TFTS.

This could not do, and Anna was at the front door of the office as Heavylegs and I arrived. I was not even in the door before Anna was screaming at me, and us, telling me that I was setting a horrible precedence for getting off of the Black List. I gave Heavylegs a kiss and told her to go on inside, and when the door closed behind her, I responded to Anna *very* politely.

**88**: I've just arrived. What the fuck are you talking about, Anna?

**Anna**: IT IS CLEAR THAT ANY WOMAN ON THE LIST CAN GET OFF THE LIST BY SLEEPING WITH YOU!

Nope. Not even going to fight this one. My cellphone is in my hands as she screeches, and Awesome Boss is called. As he had just gone home not more than a few hours before, I apologize for waking him, retrieve HR Girl's number, and give her a call.

As Anna continues to gripe at me, I inform HR Girl of the situation and request that she send someone out. Ending the call, I see HR Girl exit her office inside and come my way, stopping to lean into an office door and linger momentarily before she heads my way.

Followed by the Director of HR. 

DHR was as tall as I was, six foot five. He was far better built than I was at the time, and probably could have doubled as a granite statue if he so chose. In hindsight, it was probably good that HR Girl brought him, because she would not have been good backup as Anna described how it was bullshit that someone had to provide sexual favors for Black List removal.

As DHR exited the building, Anna turned to continue her tirade. She fell silent at DHR's upheld hand.

**DHR**: Anna, there is no reason to be screaming at this employee as he is coming in for work.

**Anna**: This man is perpetuating a list of sexual favors to be allowed to work!

**DHR**: So you decided to go around the chain of command and confront him directly? 

At this point, HR Girl comes over to me and escorts me to my desk. Our conversation is about how baseless the accusation is, until it hits us both as Girl Power, my current L2 apprentice, comes to meet us.

*How in the hell did Anna access the List?*

As GP begins to update me on the status of the file permissions, it hits us. A check of the logs later and we see the truth. Before the rights were fixed, she managed to get in. *She made a copy.* I rolled my eyes, and shook my head.

**HR Girl**: I'll speak with DHR after this and let him know.

I began the holy procedure of Cover Your Ass and gather all of the information necessary to prove that this list is not exclusive. HR Girl lets me know that DHR would like to see me, so I collect this evidence and gather a few other bits of information, just in case, before I head for HR with GP in tow.

As I approach, I see Heavylegs in the windowed office, and she is in tears.

Rage. I know exactly what is about to happen, and it infuriates me. I turn to GP, and she knows. 

**GP**: 88, you don't have to do this. 

**88**: You're right. I don't. I'm going to go in there and fight. What I need you to do is call Awesome Boss and let him know what's happening. Tell him I owe him a bottle of the good stuff, but it's time to call in a favor from Nick.

**GP**: Nick!? What does the CEO owe us? Why are you going right there?

**88**: They're about to fuck with my relationship, GP. I'm not going to let them. I'm going to go nuclear in there if I have to.

With a fist bump, we part. I turn back to the room and move to the door, opening it. Immediately, conversation stops, and the only thing I have is the scene: DHR and the Director of IT, sitting across from my now-weeping girlfriend. On the side of the Directors is Anna, smug and practically dancing in her seat.

I am told to have a seat in the chair next to the Director of IT. I politely decline, and move down to where Heavylegs was attempting to control herself. I kneel, and whisper words to her. Those words are not your business, but they helped to start the calming-down process. I kissed her on her forehead and sat down next to her, placing the rather-large folder of evidence in front of me. 

**DHR**: 88, we're here to address some serious accusations towards you and the IT department regarding the Black List. Could you tell me what your relationship is with (Heavylegs)?

**88**: My relationship status is none of your business. However, the requisite paperwork for dating a coworker is on file with your office. I have copies here of it, including your signature.

They aren't expecting this. DHR shifts uncomfortably.

**DHR**: That will not be necessary. The concerns here are that sexual harassment is occurring with women on the List; specifically, that if they sleep with you, they will be removed from the list.

**88**: Patently false. I am not even involved with the process for removal. You are. In fact, I have here a list of Black List removals, which are signed off on by HR Girl and yourself. I also have the original Black List documentation stating that the approval and removal processes both go through your office. Are you telling me, DHR, that you are also accusing me of violating the rules of this list, designed with mutual cooperation between our departments specifically to avoid this type of conduct?

*Director of IT is smiling. I am not. Rage is coursing through my body like a venomous bite looking to burn me out.* We go back and forth, DHR attempting to get me to admit to sexual harassment, and my refusal. He gets progressively madder and progressively paler as I present my evidence: 

Transcript of the meeting where Heavylegs was removed from the list. This meeting took place between Awesome Boss, Heavylegs, Heavylegs's Boss (Oh, that's Anna, isn't it?), HR Girl, and the Director of HR. It included signatures of all attendees.

One of our projects involves receiving a lot of files from another agency then processing it in our system and sending the resulting information to a third agency.

Almost every time we make some change to anything we have a conference call to organize ourselves and make sure we are covering all our bases. Here's a typical conversation:

Me: ""Ok, so we're getting two more columns added to the incoming table with XYZ column names, in 123 format, and ABC data. We know how we're processing it, what do you want us to do if it's null?""

&amp;nbsp;

Agency 2: ""We shouldn't ever get an empty field, so no don't send it to us if it's empty.""

We decide to go with returning an error code in the confirmation forms. We let them know this during the conference call.

area88guy,90,41,1qjgk1,164,"A break from my standard Black List stories; this is about one of my roommates. I call him The Boy, because he has many child-like/teenager-like qualities: 

1. He follows his penis around like a divining rod. I could tell many NSFW and not-TFTS stories...
2. Failed out of college because he wanted to play WoW in class rather than study, yet...
3. ...he claims to be just as good at computers as I am (two degrees, five years and more experience in the career field) if not better.

Last week, The Boy texted me in a very, very pissed mood. Y'see, it turns out one of our new roomates' cats had chewed on his computer's power supply wires! Oh no! Thankfully the machine had been turned off or hibernating, or we may have been having Chinese that night.

""But wait,"" those of you with half a brain are asking, ""how did the cats get into the case at all?"" Did I mention that The Boy was horrible with his money, and had his case opened up because it had been ""tricked out"" and generated too much heat for its tiny frame? 

Yes, that's right. The Boy leaves the side off of his PC case. In a house with cats. With his computer easily accessible to our four-legged friends.

As the house IT guy, it fell to me to ""investigate"" this clearly intentional damage. Upon taking a look at it, I noticed that the power cables were indeed kitty-chewed, and that the problem would be fixed with a closed case and a new power supply. Simple, right? 

WRONG BECAUSE ZOMG BRO I NEED THIS MONEY FOR GHOSTS AND BATTLEFIELD 4 AND WOW AND SHITTY INCENSE AND FAST FOOD AND...

The Boy refused to buy a new case, or a new power supply, remembering that he'd been in electrician's school for a while. Of course, *that was the school he'd failed out of*, so when he said he was fixing it, I made damn sure to move his power strip to its own breaker.

A less than polite customer was having difficulty - They recently had a PC in for depot service, and the infection they had required a fresh OS to resolve. When they got the system home, the wireless would not connect - As expected, the wireless key was not yet known to the computer. And of course, the customer had no idea how to put it in. But I guess, at least they knew it.


So, they swing by, and we loan them a network cable - Plan is to plug it in, and take remote control, and connect the wireless for them. All goes smoothly, right up until I ask them for the wireless key.


""I can't tell *you* that, it's my password"" is what was said to me. I ask if they would like to type it in themselves, because they *do* know it. I also inform them that they can hide the network key with the tick-mark at the bottom, so that I can't see it.


This seems agreeable - They then proceed to type the key in, it's their phone number. They pause, hit the tick-mark to hide the key, and then click ""Connect"". All is well in the mind of the customer. I wish them a good day.

Bagellord,10,9,1qjfuh,42,"I have failed as a tech. I let my foul mood and annoyance get in the way of my due diligence. Here's how it starts:

My mother has been selling some of her purses/shoes/whatever she no longer carries or wears. She's been taking pictures and sending them. The other night while I was attempting to do something foolish in KSP she asked me to help her since my photography skills are slightly better than the average potato. I do so, and then she goes to email 8 high res pictures via gmail (this is a Samsung GS4). I tell her that won't work too well (email size limits and all) and tell her I will come up with an alternate solution.

I retreat to my bedroom, install dropbox, log into my account, and upload the photos she wants to a folder and share it with a link, provide it to her, and all should have been well.

All was not well. Before she asked me to take care of it, she had tried to send the email several times. Gmail did not like this. Suddenly things are being weird on her phone, so she summons me to fix it (the usual ""nothings working!""). Grumbling I take the phone again and start trying to get gmail to stop trying to send the emails, and end up rebooting the phone a time or two. This was since I apparently rebooted while the SD card was mounting or something and corrupted it.

More grumbling ensues.

I start poking around with the SD card on my computer via USB and don't see anything, so I think ""Oh, it's empty. No reason not just format it and fix it."" This was where I messed up. I should have removed the card, located my card reader, and done a more thorough job. I wiped it and deleted a large chunk of her photos and such.

Of course she doesn't have G+'s photo backup on or anything like that (grumble grumble grumble). I realized what had happened when she called me from her Dr's office because she couldn't find pictures of a nasty spider bite she had. I then realized what I had done.

So now, I have the SD card hooked to my machine at work and running Recuva on it. Hopefully I can retrieve everything and then I will set up some kind of backup for the photos when I get it all back on her phone...

My lack of a decent camera has unfortunately prevented me from posting the gruesome results to /r/techsupportgore.


A fairly common problem we see are broken DC jacks. Usually someone drops the laptop while it's plugged in, or rrrrrrips the power cord out at the wrong angle. Occasionally someone sits on it. Usually it's possible to replace it and have it working and charging again, assuming the laptop isn't an ancient primordial relic (and they often are).

I was lurking in the work area at the back of shop, furrowing my brow at just why Mr X's laptop initially tries to log into a non-existent duplicate user on startup, demanding an equally non-existent password (a half-complete user profile error fix, it turned out). Meanwhile, my colleague is talking to Ms Y in the front of the shop, but being a small shop it's only behind one wall and I can hear the conversation.

Now, Ms Y had apparently brought in her laptop just recently, for a broken DC jack. I don't know why it broke the first time, but they had handed it in for the standard repair service, taken it back and it had somehow been broken again by Ms Y's husband, Mr Z. The idea of bringing in the laptop to be charged again for another replacement DC jack had not sat well with Mr Z. Since we had done it before, surely Mr  Z could do it himself and save another labour charge! So he had apparently ordered a DC jack from eBay, and attempted some amateur splicing of Parts to PC.

Ms Y then sheepishly admitted to my colleague that Mr Z had superglued the DC jack to the motherboard. Dollops of superglue. And the laptop was dead. And she was facing the significantly higher charge for a new motherboard, or whole new laptop.

I'm not super IT tech guy, I have a high interest in computer tech, software, and hardware. As most of you are probably more than aware older people tend to have problems with even the most menial of computer tasks, not judging them because it's a different generation. Well a couple years ago my dads friend asked him to ask me to help her with a problem. She had just received a free computer, the local library was upgrading to Vista (I use the term upgrade loosely here) and gave away all the Win95 computers to those who wanted them. The only problem was that she didn't know the admin password to the computer, so it was just a nice looking paper weight.

So I googled it, and found the best way to recover a password on 95 was to pop in the recovery CD. I didn't posses one, and it wasn't really a thing that was floating around at the time so I dug deeper and found what was basically a boot-from-disk brute force for 95/XP that would extract the pw and present it in plain text when it was done. It should be noted that this whole searching and re-searching thing took me quite a bit, and was buried deep in the pages before I could find it because of how old it was. So I burned it to a disk and went over to her house, started up the computer and as I went to restart noticed a piece of paper taped to the top. I pealed it off and turned it over to find ""PW: XXXXXXXXX"" printed on it.

""Between RAM and hard drives, which tends to have a larger capacity? Which tends to be more expensive per gigabyte (GB)?""

This story happened the 6th or 7th day of school. 

It was first period for me, which was Biology lab. The teacher went to go turn on her computers and it beeped. Obviously, this is usually a big uh oh for people that know what it means and not a big deal for some people who don't. 

Since I'm ""the Computer guy"" (or even worse, ""Hackson,"" which is of course because my first name, ""Jackson"" and I'm not a (complete) idiot, therefore I must hack computers), people start saying ""go fix that!""

Since I wanted to make a good first impression and not look stupid because according to my classmates I know how to fix the problem, I head up to the front of the room.

I pull up the BIOS codes on my phone for the particular Dell machine (can't remember the specific name now), and start diagnosing. 

While I'm doing this, I hear a line that still makes me laugh. The teacher asked me ""Is it because I left the disc in the drive overnight?"" This is especially funny because this teacher is not very old. She is in her mid-to-late 20s. I feel like she should have at least a basic understanding of computers, right?!

(A little note here: She just runs the Biology lab, but she is really a chemistry teacher. This woman works with chemicals. In a room. With children.)

Eventually I figure out the problem, RAM issue, fixed by replacing RAM. I didn't want to say RAM specifically because I was afraid of hearing a ""I'm not technical so I don't know that."" So I just said ""it's a memory problem"" and put a post-it on the monitor for IT to read and fix.

Two days later I had bio-lab again, so I hadn't seen her or had a status update since then. She came up to me and said ""Oh they fixed my computer! It only took them a minute! It turns out it wasn't a memory problem, it was a RAM problem!""

The first indication of anything going wrong was when the Network staff began receiving emails about the elevated temperature in the server farm. Usually this is an indication of the HVAC going out, which hasn't happened since the new server farm was built and all new HVAC equipment was installed. 

The second indication was when people started to arrive at the main office, and everything was dark. 

Because the power had been taken down at 1800 the night before (Friday night) and wasn't scheduled to be back up until after 1200 on Saturday, this meant that all of the branches that opened before 1200, couldn't function on the network until the system had been rebooted, all the day-end processes had been run, and everything was verified to be in order. 

Meanwhile, there were no phones, no email, no internet, no ILS system, nothing for all of the jurisdictions. When anyone would call any of our numbers, they'd either get voice mail or a fast busy, depending on how the VoIP line was configured. 

Everything was coordinated using cell phones and personal email until power was restored in the middle of the afternoon. The recovery involved just about every one of the Network staff, including the DBAs to bring the ILS DB back online. 

Meanwhile, the waifu and I were getting trashed on beer and wine, not caring, because it was one of our few days off together. ",Thank the Gods it was my day off...,95

bwhaines,21,18,1qh65p,96,"So I work for a university computer support center, where we assist students (and occasionally faculty) connect to the university network.  The network requires the use of an admittedly unreliable program to monitor for viruses and etc, but it's university policy, so there really isn't anything anyone can do about it but play along.  The catch to our center is that, since we are funded by university housing, we only assist on-campus student.  Today at work, this guy shows up:


Me:  ""What can I help you with?""


Customer:  ""This is where I go to get my computer connected to the internet right?""


Me:  ""Yes it is.  You have your laptop and charger with you?""


C:  ""Yeah, it's in my bag.""


Me:  ""Great, and you live on campus?""


C:  ""...yeah.""


At this point, I get suspicious.  We get people lying about that point all the time, thinking they'll weasel their way into the system.


Me:  ""Alright then, just type your ID number into this computer here and I'll get you checked in.""


(A minute later) C:  ""The computer is saying my ID number isn't valid.""


Thus, confirming my suspicions of his lying.


Me:  ""I'm sorry, where do you live on campus?""


C:  ""Actually, I live on [address redacted].""

Me:  ""Unfortunately, we can only help students who live on campus since we are a part of the housing department.""


At this point, most people realize they've been caught in a lie and walk away.  But not this guy, not this time.


C:  ""So, what if I give my computer to a buddy of mine and he brings it in?""


So, you're admitting to me that you not only lied once, but fully intend to try to trick me again?  Little does he know that if we find any evidence a computer belongs to someone other than whoever checked it in, we contact university police immediately and they can press theft charges.


Me:  ""Unfortunately, that isn't going to work.  The owner of the computer must be the one to check it in.""


C:  ""Well, can't you just help me out this once?""


Really?  After openly trying to play the system twice, you want me to do work for free AND risk my job in the process?  No thanks.

PolloMagnifico,297,491,1qguwv,1396,"**Now, a short disclaimer. This information went through two technical people before coming to me, so I may have gotten some bad information.**

At my previous job, I was responsible for managing a large number of laptops out in the field. Basically they would come in, I would re-image them, and send them back out as needed. Sadly, the guy I replaced was bad at managing his images. So we had four laptop models, and all the images were in terrible condition. Half the laptops would come back because for some reason something didn't work right.

So I set about re-doing the images, and got two of the four models re-imaged. The field supervisors thought I was the greatest thing ever, and told me their emergencies had been cut in half in the short time I had been working there. They were sleeping better, there was less downtime, and I had gotten everything so efficient I was able to re-image any number of computers that came in and get them back out the same day.

Well, something important to note was that they had a multi-install key for Microsoft Office. They refused to give me the key. And one of our images that I hadn't gotten to fixing *didn't have the right key*.

Well, we had to send out this laptop, and had no extras to send in its place. Originally it was going out in a month, but the next day it got bumped up to ""the end of the week"" and later that day to ""in two hours"". I needed the key, the head of IT wouldn't get back to me, so I used a tool (PCAudit) to pull the registry information and obtain the corporate key.

It was a very simple database that tracks the different roles that are available for advancement within the company and who currently has them. Normally, I work with SQL Server and Oracle but it wasn't worth my time and energy doing any additional work on this particular database.

Since this ""has to be secure"" I was only allowed to do work at her desk on her laptop. After some time and giving enough logical arguments to improve productivity, I was allowed to put it up on the network, in a secure location, that only the two of us had access to - that was a little better.

Then I was told that since IT could potentially see the database (not that they care) I had to further secure the database. She told me, ""I've heard about those Chinese hackers, and I don't want them to get into this very critical database!"" I almost said, ""That since we we are a multi-billion dollar company, that is probably the first thing they are going to be looking for. A database that contains what types of jobs each person has and is available is the first thing hackers are looking for."" Fortunately, I decided to hold my tongue.

I figured the best way (at least for her to think so) was to just put a password on the database itself. She thought that was great and we discussed the best password to use, for far too long.

A week later I get an email, ""What was the password we decided on?""
I'm so glad she took our security so seriously.


UPDATE: I love all the great stories!

To give you some insight to what I am dealing with, last night I was working at her laptop and her crappy mouse was barely working. So it is not frustrating enough that I am at her desk dealing with this, but to click a button takes three to five circles of the mouse before it responds to move over the button. I think my pleasant façade started to fade quickly because she said that she's been having problems with it all day, but it sometimes works. I said I had an extra at my desk but she refused it. Fortunately, I realized that if I press very hard on the mouse it does respond. So that was a good way to relieve my tension.

Then, today, I was looking at all her data entry. I saw that some people were entered twice. Those I just fix without telling her. However, one was entered as John Doe and then again as John Doo.  I asked which one is correct. She responded with 'Yes'

*Well, sounds like you've got a key pressed down or stuck.* (We've had quite a few users with keyboards that break or with stuck keys due to breadcrumbs or chocolate/candy crumbs that stick to the back of the keys.)

No, my keyboard is working just fine.

*Try pressing down each key once and see if they stick or won't respond just to make sure and then try to reboot.*

Alright, I pressed all the keys like you asked and rebooted. The keyboard feels fine and it's still giving me the error.

*Ok, alright. Hmm, you don't happen to have a USB keyboard plugged in as well?*

Oh, yes, I do actually! But I'm not currently using it.

*Well, let's take a look at it anyway. Since it's plugged in it might very well be the cause of the problems you're experiencing.*

djbattleshits,54,15,1qglxu,34,"**TL;DR EDIT**: after telling me it's a non-issue, it's apparently an issue and is being fixed. ITT - smart user, dumb IT tech I worked with, clueless middleman me, and a miraculous IT director who realized what was going on as soon as alerted.

Background on me - Not IT, I expect many critiques of my lack of knowledge below, I welcome the opportunity to learn,  but unfortunately I'm the closest thing people can call without sending a ticket to actual IT so they usually do. I get the really dumb questions and act as a much appreciated idiot filter for IT. 

My real job is to manage all company data entry and my staff of 5 processors (for mail, yes we get tons of it), and management (in terms of SQL query building/maintenence, report writing, and generally finding stuff people don't know how to find). I work at a large member based association, think American Dental Association, but not there. Point is, people pay their fees online.

I've now gotten two calls in a week about people who visit our site to pay fees, and they apparently have had their children or grandchildren put the fear of God into them about ensuring the sites they're entering their credit card info into are Secured Sites (HTTPS in the broswer). 

Because our website stops being our website at the point of sale, and just simply displays a website-like formatted version of our database with their account info to complete the transaction, there's no more HTTPS because the security isn't being handled on the web end, all submitted data is handled in-database and then securely sent to our payment processor. (correct me if I got any of this wrong, again, not IT, just close enough to know generally what's going on).

Anyway, the calls go something like this - SC- Scared Caller - ME- Me

SC: ""I tried to pay online, but I got scared because the S went away. Your site is unsecured.""

ME: ""Sir/Ma'am, the transaction you're completing isn't happening on our website, it's happening in our secured database. We've designed it to look exactly like the website so it's easier for you to use, but you can be assured it is secured. You see the (prefix for database) at the front of the URL? That means you're connected to our database securely.""

SC:""Then where's the S, you need to put that back, you're going to scare people. I don't trust your site anymore.""

ME:Facedesk, take credit card over the phone, hang up, facedesk again.

Maybe someone here will have a better way of explaining it. IT just twitches like I do, knowing they SCs are completely wrong, we aren't changing anything, and we all just sigh and sit down and hope these calls don't keep coming.

**Edit 2**- fix is a'coming, the IT reps that handle tickets are probably being schooled by their boss, more than likely my child like descriptions of things didn't help any, but again, I'm kept in the dark on purpose. 

**EDIT** - 
From the other replies and discussion it seems that 

a) SSL isn't being provided by the database provider, although they have an SSL certificate, it's not being displayed on the users end or in my sessions for that matter.

b) I can manually initiate an HTTPS session with our database, but it doesn't do that by default

c)I still don't quite grasp how somewhere between Chrome, my ISP, and the database provider, the data could get compromised, unless someone is tapping the ISP or the ISP is tapping us. 

d) Obviously much smarter minds than mine went into setting this all up, so logically, if there were a security issue with the current set up, it wouldn't be the current set up. Am I wrong?","""Your site isn't secure, I can't see the 'S' anymore""",49

-----------------------------------------------

Greetings, fellow tech support gurus! 88 here with another tale of that most blessed of lists, the Black List. For those not in the know, one of my previous positions had this idea implemented. At this time, my boss was an awesome guy, and he'd listened to my idea of The Black List, had me get the numbers together, and pitched it successfully to the C_O level. The Black List was a set of people who would receive absolutely no technical support whatsoever. This was communicated to their bosses and was not lifted until the supervisor had assured us (with proof) that the user in question had been reprimanded and instructed in better communication.

I have an absolute hatred for people who use whatever buzzword happens to be popular. Sure, there are times that such words are useful, but other times they are more of a hindrance than a benefit. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1kchjw/the_black_list_accounting_douchebaggery/) was an example of someone who knew what to say to get IT to respond immediately, and it got him in deep water.

My least favorite word is ""urgent"". In any capacity of IT, this word is seldom used properly. ""URGENT!!!!"" can range from a keyboard with a stuck key to a massive city-wide power outage. At FirstAid, we made sure to stress how much we loathed seeing that word, and encouraged better classification of issues. 

No one listened. Including the microbiology and testing facility. Everything was urgent to them, and not just ""urgent"". I could filter out ""**URGENT!!!!1**"" from our ticketing system and find no less than 20 hits. All from this department, whose R&amp;D nature made them think they were the most important group at FirstAid. The day in question was no different.

A new tech had recently joined the group, and I shall nickname her Girl Power. Why? GP was outgoing, social, bubbly-but-not-braindead, and most of all smart as a whip. A box of whips. A crate of whips on the USS Whip. Gp knew her stuff, but hadn't yet had the chance for practical experience beyond a Tier 1 helpdesk position. She was my first hire, and I was immensely proud to show her the ropes. To this day, she's like a kid sister, and accompanied me on any rounds I needed to make. 

I arrived one morning with my frequent armload of caffeine and fried sugar for the L1 techs, and noticed that GP had brought them a case of Coke that morning. A tear threatened to break past my defenses, but I sucked it up and distributed the doughnuts as best as I could remember. Several L1s mentioned that GP and The Boss were looking for me, so I squared everything away and headed for my desk. 

Nearly immediately after logging in, I was pulled into a three-way IM conversation by The Boss. It turned out that there had been a bit of a disagreement with the microbiology and testing labs regarding a series of computer issues that they were having. 

They thought we should devote 100% of our resources in IT to fixing their computers, and my Boss disagreed.

The first message after The Boss explained things made me giddy with excitement. You see, GP had not yet been hipped to the Black List, and while she'd known we were hiding something from her, she hadn't yet figured it out. So, when we were sent: 

The Boss: 88, time to brief your shadow on the list.

...I may have peed a little. 

Boss explained that three of the seven primary lab computers were experiencing slowdown of a degree that could not be remotely determined. L1 techs had failed to placate the labrats' complaints and cries of ""URGENT!!!!111oneone"", and someone had decided to fill out a ticket for the issue...

...every ten minutes...

...since 2:00AM that day.

It was currently 9:30AM.

The Boss released us to execute on our own recognizance, and I swung by GP's desk to pick her up. Armed with our wits and our skill, we headed for the facility. I briefed her along the way, and I swear her eyes took on a glow that could only be described as ""**PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER!**"". I then described the ""itty bitty living space"" part, and also told her what to expect at the facility.

Any of you who have done time near any sort of medical testing or waste will know that the smell is abysmal. It smells like Godzilla took a runny shit on a bloated corpse, added jalapenos, and then cooked it all for a few years. Between this and the nature of the work, anyone entering the facility was required to wear biohazard suits after checking in. 

We did so, and entered the facility, making our way quickly to the affected testing area. What we found was no less horrific than a library with collapsed bookshelves. I'm no biologist, or biochemist, but the state of this particular lab went against every fiber of my being. GP choked on what I can only suspect was bile as we took in the scene, while I deftly stepped in front of her to meet the onslaught of researchers.

Alpha Douchebag decided to step up first and declare that we were ""hours late"". I raised a hand and cut him off. ""Don't care. Lead us to the affected machines."" More sputtering and cursing ensued, and I raised my voice. ""I'll call the board and have your team shut down if you utter another syllable. Lead. On.""

Stunned silence, shocked face, and then finally blessed movement. We were led to three machines in the back of the room, near some of the dirtier sections of the room. The machines in question were filthy and indeed sluggish. I logged each user out and shut the machines down, a nagging suspicion in the back of my head. Instructing GP to disconnect the other two machines, I unplugged mine and put it on its side. Opening the case confirmed my suspicions.

What could best be described as a growth of bacteria had crept into the motherboard. It had started at the ""bottom"" and found a power line, snaking its way towards the processor fan and the primary hard drive. The former was, I can only hazard a guess, protected by the fact that it was moving ""blades"" that somehow kept the monster at bay. 

The hard drive's board, however, was covered, and to this day I have no idea how this gunk hadn't made it INTO the drive itself and fried it.  I immediately dropped the drive into the case and reached for one of the phones to call The Boss. A similar clunk behind me told me that GP had found something similar in one of hers.

88: Boss, you really aren't going to believe what we've found here.

AD: IS THAT YOUR BOSS? PUT HIM ON SPEAKERPHONE, YOU IDIOTS NEED TO LEARN THE MEANING OF URGENT!

Boss: I heard that. Don't bother. What did you find?

GP and I described the scene in excrutiating detail, all the while keeping AD at bay. I eventually handed GP the phone to tell her share of the story and squared off with AD.

88: Explain to me why-

AD: SHUT YOUR MOUTH! I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR SUPERVISOR! MY BOSS IS (middle management person name) AND SHE WILL NOT BE PLEASED AT THE LACK OF PROGRESS!

88: Perhaps, then, you should go ahead and call her down.

AD: I WILL!

AD trundled off to call his boss, and I turned back to wait for GP to finish. She did, and handed me back the phone. The Boss authorized the Black Listing even before I asked about it, but I wanted to make sure we had this one nailed down.

88: Boss, is Matcha watching the cameras?

Boss: He can be. Do you need evidential backup?

88: I do. Plus, I need you down here. (AD) is pulling his boss down here, and we're going to have a serious issue on our hands. If you can, bring HR Girl. You aren't going to believe the state of this room.

Boss: I believe you. We're on our way.

Hanging up, I informed GP of what was about to go down, and she actually wrung her hands with anticipation. We stood back and I moved the machines to give the cameras a somewhat better view, but I knew better than to try to get pictures myself.

In came The Boss with HR Girl, and both began to inspect the room. When The Boss came down to us and looked in the computers, he actually gagged. ""Words never do this sort of thing justice."" GP and I agreed, and HR Girl was positively green in her suit. AD and AD's Boss arrived next, and were stunned to find GP and I with backup. AD barely entered into his tirade before his boss started walking toward us. The Boss held out a hand to indicate that she should inspect the computers. She did so, with that trained calm that most researchers in movies are portrayed as having, and looked at me, then GP, and finally my Boss before speaking.

""I'm a computer idiot, and this looks bad even to me. Are these machines broken because of this biohazard?""

The Boss looked to me, and I shrugged. ""I cannot be certain. I refuse to work on this machine, however, due to this biohazard. I refuse to let any technician under my umbrella work on this machine for the same reason, and we do not have a safe room prepared for this sort of instance.""

My Boss nodded his assent, and AD's Boss nodded as well. She turned to HR Girl and my Boss. ""I formally apologize for this breach of containment for this bacteria. I will get to the bottom of this immediately and accept any sanction for our team that is necessary, as well as providing information on which bacteria this is.""

AD was furious. The Boss grinned and nodded at me, and I delivered our favorite line to AD's Boss regarding her workers. ""We have a list of several people who felt it necessary to submit tickets every ten minutes this morning about this issue, neglecting to inform us of the state of your lab. These users also decided that it was necessary to use words designed to make this problem our top priority. In hindsight, it should have been everyone's priority. Due to their conduct with our ticketing system, with the authorization of (Director of IT), and backed by (Director of Operations) as well as supported by (HR Director), I am notifying you that your techs (names here) are now on the IT Black List. This means that they will not be permitted to submit helpdesk emails, they will not be allowed to delay any updates, and they will not be responded to in any form regarding an IT-related incident. HR Girl is here to witness this, as well as to take evidence for FirstAid as necessary for conduct in this lab.""

AD's sputtering obscenities could be heard behind all of us, making sure we knew that we were all morons and that their very important research was being ruined by our carelessness. AD's Boss was red in the face, either from anger or embarassment. She nodded with my statement and apologized again, and we took our leave. 

For the next week, L1 techs were treated to lunch by the Microbiology and Testing Department as an apology for flooding the queues. GP was a bit shaken from how disgusting everything was, but caffeine set her straight. We decided to completely destroy the hard drives, since they were little more than OS drives with shortcuts to various network programs/drives anyhow, rather than even attempt to clean them. They were disposed of in accordance with state and federal laws.

Oh, and AD was fired, and I think sued. The litigation would have left his asshole in ruins. Turns out he was the main perpetrator of the lab's condition.

I never stepped foot in the labs again.

Hope you are doing well.  

My father told me you might be a good person to speak to.  I had a rudimentary software built a while back and need to make it much more dynamic and less ""Excel"" in orientation.  He said you may be able to take on a side job and build me a GUI interface and make it look sexier.  
  

What is your email address?  I'd like to create a couple of logins for you to see the tool, look at the back-end reporting that our account managers and dealer clients see, and give me an estimate on what it would take to make it pop.

Side note: I've never offered to help any of my family members. However, I have told them many times before that I don't take side jobs.  
One of the things I hate most about being contacted by family members for this sort of thing is that they always use the most teeth-gritting causing buzzwords that make my skin crawl, too.  

I just told my cousin that I just accepted a new job at a new company and that I don't take side jobs. I hope he handles it well.

His response:  
Damn - that isn't a great answer :)  

Alright... I'll use someone in India.  

I take it you don't have any advice on what type of person I should be reaching out for, do you?  Do you know estimates on what something like that might cost?

Congrats on the new job, by the way.  

To which I reply:  
Depends on what exactly you're asking for. If you want a design, you'll need to hire a designer. If you want it to be built out on top of your tool, you'll also need a developer. There's a lot to consider, which is part of why I'm turning you down.  

You said you have software, which is excel-ish, but hosted online. So I assume it's something like a .NET application. If it's PHP or Java, you'll need to make sure that whoever you hire to make the edits will know how to work within those platforms.  

Before you can hire someone to make those edits, you'll need to provide that type of information. You may want to work with a recruiting agency that can hook you up with the right type of developer. Silicon Valley has a ton of recruiting agencies that reach out to lots of people. I'm sure that Chicago has a lot as well.

SapphireSilence,20,70,1qe168,300,"So, as stated in a previous story, I work for my university's help desk. More importantly, I take the Saturday shifts. It's nice - I work alone, very few calls, I have some time to read and do assignments. Not this time. The events of this story happened roughly 2 months ago, 2 weeks into the semester...

So I get to work about 5 minutes before the shift actually starts (1 PM), set up my call logging software and take the phone off forwarding. Almost immediately I get an incoming call, which should have been my first clue. 

Me: Blah Blah University help desk, this is SapphireSilence speaking, how can I help you?

Student: Yeah, do you know when the wifi in (residence hall) is coming back?

M: I wasn't informed of any planned downtime.

S: We're not even getting (our connection management software) to come up.

M: That's odd... I'll check on the status of that building and give a call back. 

I never got a chance. After that call, I was flooded with at least 5 other calls in the span of four minutes. Each one from a different building. By 1:10 PM, I'm close to panicking because out of about 20 or so buildings, 8 of them have no network access. I called my boss and the head of the networking department, both of whom had no idea what was causing this and worked with me for two hours to fix the issue. And the entire time, the phone is ringing off the hook with students and staff not being able to access the net. 

Turns out (from what I understand of the resolution) one of two main controllers for our network had planned downtime that Friday night. Once that controller was taken offline, it was supposed to switch to the backup unit automatically, but the person who took it offline didn't check that the backup unit kicked in.

racutt,11,22,1qdxh0,87,"Obligatory first time post, blah blah blah.

Anyways! Here's a short one for you all here at TFTS! Now I'm just the basic High School Senior/Family tech support, but it's things like this that question my sanity. 

Quick background, my father is very tech illiterate, but he is one of those who WANTS to learn and is always willing to. He is a point and press like typer, but is surprisingly fast than I thought he was capable of, where 2 years ago he had trouble watching a video on youtube.

Now, this morning, he comes up to me wanting to respond to a post on craigslist. Now for some god forsaken reason, if you try to send the email through the direct outlook/live link, the client does not recognize the sending address as being valid. All he had to do was copy the address, and paste it into the ""send to"" dialogue box. The conversation went something like this:

racutt: Okay click in the box

D: This box?

racutt: Yes, now press ctrl A

D: What does that do

racutt: It selects all text, now just-

D: I can just right click and press copy

Proceeds to do so only selecting the first quarter of the address and then getting frustrated that it wont send (mind you this is on a laptop touch  pad, so I feel his pain)

racutt: You have to pres ctrl A

Holds down the buttons for a good 5 seconds

D: Now what?

racutt: Now press ctrl C

Again, holds down the buttons for 5 seconds.

racutt: Now go to your email and go to where it says ""send to"" and press ctrl v

D: why do they make this so difficult?

Does so, and surprisingly doesn't hold down the buttons and correctly pastes it this time.

racutt: Okay, now type your message and press send

D: That it?

racutt: Yup

Following me giving him a cheat sheet on how to do all this himself. I am glad he wants to learn, and actually retains the information, but sometimes it's hard to explain what he thinks is hard, takes an average person literally 2 seconds to do.

StonedPhysicist,173,152,1qdqjr,703,"Spent two years in IT support, mostly dealing with students who couldn't read sequential lists of instructions, or remember to keep their antivirus up-to-date. After leaving that job, I went on to do some lab tech work, and thought I was free from laptop woes, until **he** arrived.

**Day 1:**  
About 16:55 one evening, I was about ready to go home and I got a knock on my door:

&gt;*Student*: ""That row of computers suddenly turned off.""  
*SP*: ""Alright, let's take a look. Not really my department, but... okay, I assume the circuit breaker must have come on. I'll have to get someone to take a look in the morning, just use some of the other PCs.""  
*Student*: ""Oh okay. It just happened when I plugged my laptop in.""

I fired off an email to the IT tech, who said that that row was quite bad for tripping the circuit breaker, so not to worry, he'd sort it out in the morning.

**Day 2:**  
All I had left to do was some admin work during the last hour of my day, until I hear a familiar voice at my door:

&gt;*Student*: ""Hi, I was wondering whether you could take a look at my laptop? It's not charging.""  
*SP*: ""Again, I don't really deal with computers any more, let alone personal ones, but... I guess I can look and see if it's anything obvious?""  

The student then takes out his power supply, and just slides the outer casing straight off (**alarm bells immediately ringing**) and points at several smouldered components.  

&gt;*Student*: ""Could you maybe fix this? It's been weird for a while.""  
*SP*: ""Uhh... no. Tell you what, here's the address of a repair place nearby. Just get a new power supply, it's a fairly standard one you've got.""

**Day 3**
Friday has finally arrived. I have my coffee nice and warm, but the mug doesn't even make it halfway to my lips when my door opens:

&gt;*Student*: ""Uhh.. do you have a 3-pin plug adaptor I could borrow?""  
*SP*: ""I doubt it, sorry. How did you manage to get a European plug instead of a UK one?""  
*Student*: ""It's not a European one, it's the cable from my old adaptor. I mean... you know how there are three pins?""  
*SP*: ""Yes...?""  
*Student*: ""Well, mine doesn't have the top one, and without it, the plug won't work.""  
*SP*: ""Yes, that's the earth. if it's not earthed, the plug doesn't w... wait, you're wanting to use a plug without an earth, which fried your old power supply, and tripped the circuit breaker?""

Me: What do you mean you opened it up?!? What did you do with the battery?


I: I threw it in the bin. I thought it was broken.


It is at this time that K walks back in to the office, coffee in hand, and notices the laptop's lack of a battery.

Unfortunately, I just can't keep quiet about this one. 

We have a particularly troublesome client of ours. Despite many attempts, he refused to call our support line and log his call. Many of his issues could have been dealt with by our tier 1 team. Users added to distribution groups, helping a user with a printing issue, that sort of thing.

Instead he opted to ringing me and my colleague on tier two directly. If he couldn't reach us, he would email. Nine times out of ten, he would email at ten to five expecting things done immediately. He would refuse to take calls from out tier 1 reps, even our senior tier 1 was blown off by him.

Now, when this guy talked, he ran. Every word and sentence comes spewing out in a mess of spaghetti.

For fifteen minutes he sat, screaming, taking so quickly I could barely understand him as I tried to diagnose the issue. When he finally stopped talking I confirmed that yes, the spreadsheet hadn't been put into the queue to be run. All he needed to do was add the information into it and click go. (We were strictly hands off because the information was financial in nature)

He screamed. The verbal spaghetti continued. He wanted us to do it, all of it. No matter how often I tried to tell him that we weren't allowed to touch it he went off on another rant.

Eventually I yelled back ""We WON'T do it. We want to but we can't because our lawyers and your lawyers TOLD us not to touch it""

She was really nice and professional asking me if I could look at her laptop and do a general clean. I kindly informed her that I would love to, but I was about 500 miles away for school. Her response: ""When will you be home?""

The saga continues.

The Owner has found an external hard drive that's 2 years old that used to be the backup drive, however it's apparently corrupted or something. She's sending it to me to look at it and figure out whether anything's recoverable off it.

We talked and she's done some investigating on her own, and basically she's scared shitless of trying to go into Tor and pay some nameless, faceless person what's now about $3k with zero guarantee of getting anything back. She'd rather pay to have a clean room recover her hard drive for $1k (the one she's sending me) since she'd know, at least, that the money was going someplace reputable.

Lastly, I logged into Teamviewer and grabbed the key and I'm trying to figure out what the passkey / passphrase is. If you guys want to take a shot at it, have fun. I'm doing this for her as a favor, but mostly because I want to see if I can do it.

**Lady:**  Hello, yes, the wifi doesn't work on my laptop and this is very inconvenient.

**Me:** OK, which one are you connecting to?

**Lady:** What do you mean?

**Me:** What's the name of the network you're connecting to?

**Lady:** NameOfCompany.  But it doesn't work.  Sometimes it works after five but never during the day.

**Me:** Right. So it only works in the evenings?

**Lady:** Yes, after five, before that it doesn't work.

**Me:** Could you bring the laptop over to us in person?

**Lady:** It is not my laptop. It works at home.  Your wifi doesn't work properly

**Me:** At home it will be a different connection so we would still need to check the settings for NameOfCompany to see why it doesn't work.

**Lady:** But it works at home - it is nothing technical!!

**Me:** Yes, but you have a different network at home.  It has different settings.

**Lady:** It is NOT my laptop!  It is nothing technical!  I do not want to waste my time coming to the desk, just fix it now, it will waste 2 hours of my time to come and see you.

*(this is doubtful as she's on site and we're no more than 10 minutes walk for anyone)*

**Me:** I can't fix it without knowing what we're looking for.  There's no reason for the wifi to work only after 5pm.  Are you sure you can't bring it over to us?

**Lady:** Well I didn't bring it with me today because it's useless!

**Me:** Next time you bring it into work, you can come over and see us and we'll get it working.

**Lady:** BUT IT WORKS AT HOME SO DO I HAVE TO QUEUE?

**Me:** Er... As I said the network you'll have at home is different so-

**Lady:** NO!  That's not what I meant.  It works at home so do I still have to queue when I come?

**Lady:** There is always a queue at the desk! Do I have to still queue with the people?

**Me:** If there's a queue, *yes*, you have to queue in it.

Bland pleasantries exchanged and we end it at that.

After much discussion around the office, we concluded that the reason it works after five is probably because she's taken it back home again and is using her flawless sparkly totally functional home wifi... and has in fact probably never connected to the one at work.

If she came to the desk in person, I certainly didn't get her, so we may never know whether the wifi started working before five.

About a week ago I went into my class, set up my laptop, and started doing coding for my java final, about 15m later the class started and everyone with a desktop discovered that they had no internet connection.

After about 5 minutes of troubleshooting with the teacher, I remembered that I had been working on some networking booting stuff on one of my desktops. 
As it turned out, when I turned of the software, it didn't kill the DHCP server it was using for the netboot. 

The upshot was that when I  reconnected the computer to the main network, my little man in the middle DHCP server was a shorter hop for all wired clients in the class, and as such prevented any of them from accessing the internet.

HildartheDorf,27,22,1q9h5a,120,"So, as resident IT person for our small (25ish people) for our company (with, you know, a whole full time job that isn't IT to be getting on with). And someone utters those horrid, horrid words. The ones that make me want to run away screaming. ""The printer isn't working.""

So I go have a look, it's one of the main office printers (along side the dot matrix), an almost antique HP laserjet, thankfully it's not a networking issue, but it's leaving an enormous black smear down the left side of every page. So I warn everyone not to print to it, unplug it, strip it down, get the drum out, to find a label stuck to the drum. Completely black (the labels are ""printed"" with heat, so the temperature inside the printer had made it go black), so I have no idea what it had on it originally. Trying to take it off just makes the entire drum disintegrate into brittle shards of plastic in my hands.

So now we have no printer (that accepts plain A4 at any rate, the dotmatrix uses pre-printed triplicate-invoice paper) in the office. Ask if I can redirect everyone to General Manager's printer while we wait for a new one. Share the GM's printer on the network, add it to everyone's machine, brief GM that he needs to leave his computer on or no one else can print. Everything is fine.

Get new printer next day, it uses USB. Print server uses Parallel ports. I face-desk. Ask boss, acquire old unused PC, install debian over the weekend, install print server, bring it in, set it up. Install driver on everyone's machines, set default to the new printer on the new server. Inform everyone that the new printer is working, you don't need to disturb GM any more.

Later that day, Gormless Office Worker (GOW) walks in, claiming the ""printer doesn't work"". Knowing GOW this probably means that Word is uninstalled because the shortcut moved. I swear, storm in, print test page to new printer. It works (obviously). Ask what is wrong ""well when I pressed print, nothing happened"". Spend half an hour trying to reproduce this fault (did I mention I have my own job I'm now like a day behind on?).

GM walks in, goes to his office, turns his machine on, swears loudly. Over a hundred print jobs belonging to GOW all start trying to come out of his printer. GOW had decided to manually print to GM's printer because ""I thought that one was still broken"". Ignoring the fact it's a completely different shape, size, still shiny with newness, next to a brand new server, the default had been changed back again to said new one, and everyone else is printing to it fine. And of course, she pressed print 99 more times when it didn't work the first time, just to be sure.

I mutter something about ""default must have switched back when GM turned his on"" and unshare the GM's printer. Then go back to my own job and smash my head into a wall.

OfficerNelson,82,89,1q8aro,342,"My [last theatre tech story](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1o8vfm/when_the_light_is_green_the_trap_is_clean/) was moderately well-received, so here's something far more sinister and equally as lengthy. Trust me, it's long, but the ending is great. And it's sort of being written live!

I work as a lightboard op in a highly-rated regional black box theatre. It's small (holds around 200 people) but much more fun and fiscally rewarding than my volunteer work at other theatres.

**Boring technical stuff...**
At my other jobs, we had pretty crappy equipment. My first spot around 8-9 years ago had an ETC Expression, which was good for its time, but we weren't allowed to program cues - we had to do all blackouts and crossfades manually. After that, I jumped to a really cheap black box theater which had some tiny off-brand board, after that we didn't even have a dedicated board, and my last volunteer job had a *really* shitty Express, which IIRC supports only a pitiful ~100 channels (even though we had 3x as many cans).

Anyways, this current place is suitably equipped. I've spent some unpaid overtime just poking around the manual to see what this lightboard can do. However, the master electrician (hereafter ME) has a real bulge over the new soundboard which we got over the summer, which is very nice and does make me a bit jealous - watching the motorized faders is mesmerizing. The thing must have cost a pretty penny, because the technical director mentioned that he maxed out our budget for quite some time with it.

One of the features of the new soundboard is it can be controlled from a smartphone. This is really, really helpful when doing pre-show checks, and in theory you could run the show from anywhere in the theatre (we have wireless headsets as well). Since the ME couldn't shut the hell up about this, I figured it would be used pretty often - well, once the board was installed, it wasn't used once.

After a few months, I got sick of it and did some research of my own - to my elation, my older lightboard *also* has this feature. I didn't want to involve the ME just yet (you may remember in the last story that he is generally unhelpful and he doesn't even know what a ""lighting plot"" is) so I got to work.

First, I found an ethernet cable (CAT6, even!) and figured out where the wireless router was - a WRT54G, my favorite. Patched the lightboard into it and got to work.

Now, I will give the ME credit. He did manage to figure out what WPA2 is, and did hide the SSID (as useless as that is). Since the only thing that connected wirelessly was his smartphone with the soundboard app, I couldn't listen for the SSID. I tried to connect through LAN on my laptop, but for some reason the router was connected to our campus internet, so it wasn't able to use the default IP. Since I liked my job too much to get into anything more grey-hat, I shot the ME an email asking for help on this endeavor.

The ME replied a week later (after the trial of the smartphone app ran out, prompting me to front $50 to unlock it):

&gt;I tried to set this up already, but the board keeps dropping the connection every 10 minutes. Don't waste your time.

What he failed to realize was that every 10 minutes, the trial version of the smartphone app *purposely disconnected* with a message stating to unlock the full version. I threw a message back explaining this and giving a rough explanation of what I wanted to do. Surprisingly, he replied with the information, so I got to work.

First things first, the router was configured way wrong. ME apparently forgot to turn off its DCHP server, so it wasn't playing nice with the campus network. Additionally, he placed the soundboard in the DMZ (great idea, having a critical show component fully remotely accessible to anyone). I actually have it on good authority from a connection in IT that the ME got some serious flak for this thing before, so it's a shock that he connected it back into the network anyway, especially in its state. (Apparently this is because he wouldn't be able to use the internet on his phone while connected to the WRT54G - a fair complaint, even though switching networks on my Nexus 4 takes about a second, although I don't know how long it takes on an iPhone.)

Regardless, I fixed his mistakes, and looked at the board. I noticed something strange. The default IP was changed, DCHP was manually enabled, and the remote access settings were switched on - all of which were changed from before I sent that email. Did some omnipotent being set this up for me? (*hint: no.*)

I fixed the router, got everything connected, and fired up my phone - after some initial setup, I finally got it to work. I took a stroll around the theatre, flipping through channels, the stage manager panicking that the board was running on its own. I cracked the code... pre-show would never be the same again.

Of course, look at the scroll bar - this story is far from over.

The next day, I got an email from the technical director. ME had complained to him that I had broken into the wireless router and intentionally ruined the settings so that the show wouldn't be able to run. The technical director, fortunately, is not an idiot, so I offered for him to come to the show that night and I'd show what happened.

Unsurprisingly, he did show up and I walked him through what I did. I explained how the router was negligently configured and how the ME took my explanation and tried to do it himself. To seal the deal, I connected over my phone, sat down on the set, and recited one of the most memorable scenes in the show, and pulled up the lights at just the right time. He looked up at the board - nobody there - turned around, and excitedly asked me to see my phone. I gladly showed him everything that could be done with it. He was totally ecstatic, and lamented that he couldn't offer me a raise (ironically the budget was blown by buying the new soundboard).

What I *didn't* expect was for him to let the ME know what I *actually* did.

Today (a week later), after a few shows worth of dancing around the stage triple-checking every light just for the fun of it, I noticed something strange - the lightboard was throwing a networking error on boot, and the soundboard failed to boot at all. I figured there was something wrong with the router - well, to my surprise, it was gone. I tracked the wires... they snaked into a hole drilled into the wall next to a locked closet.

Yep, the ME decided to move the router, breaking the boards in the process. The lightboard could boot, but the soundboard wouldn't... and without the soundboard, we simply can't run the show.

I shot an email to the TD straight away. Unless we can fix this router problem, we have to cancel the show. If we cancel the show, we lose money. Naturally, the TD wasn't keen on explaining to the board of directors why a show was cancelled, so he drove on down and we got to work.

First, he had the keys to the closet, so we got that open. I checked out the router - nothing. Totally dead. Power cycling did nothing, and there was no switch on it.

15 minutes before the show. House is open, people are filing in, and we might have to send them home.

Naturally, this had to be a power issue or a defective router. I contemplated racing home and simply swapping out the router with mine for the night (same model, how hard could it be?) but that would have taken another 45 minutes - time we didn't have. So, while the TD skimmed the soundboard manual to see why no network = no boot, I started tracing the power cable.

First, the power brick was plugged into a surge protector, which was switched on but wasn't getting power. That, in turn, was plugged into an extension cable - one of those giant orange ones which coincidentally appeared in my last story - which snaked back out of the same hole and was plugged into the ancient UPS which runs the amp racks. I checked the UPS - overload light was on. I reset it, it ran for a split second, and shut back down from an overload. Unplugged the extension cord, tried again, and surprise - no overload. Somehow, the immense draw from this wireless router was blowing this UPS, and the ME failed to notice that when he plugged it in, all of the amps would shut off.

I plugged the extension cable into a wall outlet, the router flipped on, and the boards sprung into life - 10 minutes after the show was supposed to begin.

I sat down and checked the router again. This time, the *lightboard* was in the DMZ, and he tried to set up port forwarding... from WAN straight into the lightboard's remote control. Things are going to get ugly.

I kept watch over the router, and soon noticed a connection from way outside the campus network - in fact, from a city an hour away, where the ME lives...

... and sure enough, commands started coming in to the board remotely. All channels at full. All channels out. Patching commands. Cue overwrites. Somebody with specific knowledge of this board's IP, device name, password, and who lives surprisingly close to the ME and had paid $50 for a remote app was trying to completely sabotage this show. Fortunately, I was smart enough to disable remote command execution.

As I'm writing this, we're about 80% through the show. The TD just popped his head up from the stairwell and told me to expect a promotion, then scurried off while I was left speechless.

This is perhaps the only guy who could turn moving a router 5 feet into an RGE.

**TL;DR:** ME, ME, he's our man, if he can't do it, hope he has another job offer lined up.

BookInvertebrate,23,11,1q82n6,75,"Hey all, Having fun reading all the great stories. I decided to share today's headache of a call.

It comes from guy, I’ll call him Mr. Clueless who I have helped about four times with the same problem. He had two laptops that used a in-house developed software to automatically upload data to an FTP on a very restricted wifi connection.

These laptops are field laptops that go out, gather data from devices (going to be vague here) and then come back to a warehouse and upload that data over night. Every time he calls, he tells me they're broken and did not upload over night, and when I ask him to do a few things on the laptop, he says they were already sent out to the field and won't be back until evening.

3/4 times this went down we had to get him to bring the laptops to us (which took him sometimes days to do) so that we could test a few things. two times it was on our end because the FTP server was changed by the server admins and the other two were something wrong on the laptop. The application had wrong import information (there was a config file - that somehow got its passwords changed)

Here is the 5th call, again the laptops had not uploaded overnight.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Mr. Clueless:** Hi Bookinvertebrate, both laptops did not load the data again.

(I open up my FTP and load the credentials that the laptop would be using, the FTP is up and running, I move a file over to test that it would accept it, that is working fine.)

**BookInvertebrate:** Ok, did you make sure that you had a connection to the wireless-,

**Mr. Clueless:** You need to check your server, something is wrong.

(Thank you for interupting me, knowing him in the past, he is usually emphatic and kind of neurotic, so I take a deep breath)

**BookInvertebrate:** Yes, I see that the FTP server is up. Have you tried loading filezilla (we put filezilla on the laptops for troubleshooting) on the laptop to check to make sure it was connecting, and that the credentials were working.

**Mr. Clueless:** It’s obviously not the password because both laptops went down at the same time.

**BookInvertebrate:** Ok, yes, I understand this, but these steps help me figure out the larger issue, because I see no issues on my end. Can you maybe get in front of one of the laptops and I can guide you on what to do.

**Mr. Clueless:** I already deployed them in the field. (NOOoooooooooo) It’s not the laptops, they both did not upload, you need to check your stuff!

(Already frustrated that he again deployed them before calling the help desk to help troubleshoot, I carried on.)

**BookInvertebrate**: We really need to test on those laptops, they are configured uniquely, so it’s hard for me to narrow it down without having one of those laptop on the warehouse connection to test -

**Mr. Clueless:** I’ve been doing this for thirty years, young lady, it’s not the laptops (Even though I have never said it was the laptops) Think about it this way, if you had two broken toasters and they broke at the same time, would you start tinkering on one to see why it broke (He says this in the most self satisfied I-got-you voice)

(I am literally trying to figure out how the hell we got to talking about toasters, while simultaneously pulling my hands through my hair.)

**BookInvertebrate:** Well, I would take one of those toasters, figure out how it broke, maybe follow the power cord-,

**Mr. Clueless:** I am not checking the laptops, this is a waste of my time! there is no way there is a problem with them!

(I pull out my trump card, someone who oversees a lot of these special lap deploys and works in that guys department. He asked that he be clued in the next time this issue happens because of all the resources we waste trying to fix this without preliminary troubleshooting. I’ll call him Mr. Smart)

**BookInvertebrate:** Fine, I’ll just talk to Mr. Smart - he mentioned that he would like to assist with these in the future.


**Mr. Clueless:** Fine, close my ticket, since you don’t want to do the work - I’ll just go to Mr. Smart from now on.


**BookInvertebrate:** That’s not what I’m saying, I just need a few steps-


**Mr. Clueless:** Cancel my ticket, I’ll go to him. (click)


Frustrated I write a document with 4 different ways to troubleshoot. With steps to check the wireless connection, check the FTP with filezilla, to ping the FTP server, etc All with pretty screenshots (All stuff I showed mr. clueless in person). . I email this to Mr. Clueless and CC Mr. Smart, stating that it would be helpful if these steps could be completed on one of those laptops so we could narrow down this issue.

I get an IM from Mr. Smart apologizing for Mr. Clueless not following previous instruction. He states that earlier the warehouse had some wireless issues, because one of the guys there unplugged a cable (It’s a cabinet open to them unfortunately). He said that the tech should have checked the connection, and that all will be working with the upload tonight. 

And this guy wanted me to check my damn server. &gt;:|

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR: Laptops don’t upload files to an FTP over night, the caller did not want to test because it was obviously our servers. He knows better because he had 30 years of experience, likens the issue to broken toasters. IT figures out it was the laptop wireless connection.

samurai-technician,3,13,1q7zz7,31,"**In the Flesh**

One of our customers opened a sister office 400 miles away. 

We sold them a Multi-Funk Machine(*) a few months ago, and subsequently were lucky enough to ship another one to their new sister offce. It prints and it scans. It scans to USB and it scans to network folders. It scans to desktop folders and it scans to it's own folders. It scans to email and it prints envelopes. It prints two-sided postcards in color and it blends...solid-ink blocks together when you move or jar it before you power off and let the 'wax' cool.

""So while you're on the phone with them,"" says The Office Manager, ""[...setup all the functions the machine has to offer...], and have them ftp the 'Stupid Suck Software'. We need those S&amp;M-P Statistics. O-k-a-a-y Y-i-e-e?""


We deliberately let her over-hear technical words for amusement and profit. 


The IT guy at the local office is a perfectly capable man. He knows his stuff, so why do I have to get involved at all 400 miles away? 

Plus...Plus, his limited, broken English and his very soft-spoken voice make effective two-way communication draining. Even his cell phone transmissions suck. I can send him an email with particulars and that's that. He's their IT guy. I'm just a rent-a-tech that comes with the initial setup of any machine.

.


""What do you want me to do?"" I whined.

.


""We don't want our customers to feel that we're just drop shipping. You'll call them and you'll set everything up. We charged them for one hour of your remote time so anything over, let me know and we'll send them a bill. B-y-e. B-y-e-y-e-e""  


A reprimand was forthcoming.


She put her foot down and tinkled her fingers at me as she left my office. It was 3pm--time to go home if I don't vomit. 

.


IT guy doesn't start his shift until 6pm. 

I call from my home phone. 

IT guy forgot how to do everything. 


My side of the conversation:
""I don't know... What account did you use last time?... What's the IP address of the server in North Bumfuque?... I don't know... You setup the users...etc.""


His side of the conversation:
""eh.can't.eh.log.eh.failed&lt;garble&gt;tomorrow.re.eh.boot.eh&lt;garble&gt;server.""


After a bit of silence, I guessed it was my turn to speak, so I responded with, ""What!?""


Then he lost his VPN connection.

By 10pm he had regained connection to the Sister Office. 
With my guidance (roll eyes in back of head), he setup a user on their local domain for the Multi-Funk Machine(*) to use for email scanning and to dump PDFs on ""eh.&lt;garbled&gt;server"". He setup three printer shares--one for color, one for B&amp;W, and one for fax. He downloaded from our FTP site, installed, and configured the 'Stupid Suck Software', and had it register and synchronize the machine statistics gathered via SNMP.

MrTilly,21,23,1q7xey,49,"This is my first time posting, and I don't know what you guys are looking for, but I hope you all will be as massively frustrated with this student as I was when this happened.  This story isn't as technologically impressive as most of your stories, but maybe this will be of interest to you all.

Let me give you all some back story.  I work part time at the Tech Help center on campus here, and of course we have our days of awfully ignorant customers, but I'd rather have some work than no work.  Me and my coworker are working together one day, my coworkers name was L.  In walks this cliche sorority girl called R.

So R walks in and L takes her, the conversation is as follows.

**L:** ""Hi, how can I help you today?:

**R:** ""Okay so, every time I turn on my computer, nothing happens at ALL!  It stays like black for the longest time, and then I get all this text on it and nothing happens!""

**L:** ""Okay ma'am, do you mind if I take a look at it and see what that text says?""

So L proceeds to take her laptop from her, and boots it up normally.  She's running a Lenovo Thinkpad with Windows 7.  The boot sequence takes place, and gets stuck just after bios, with the error reading about a hard drive error.  L proceeds to tell R about what the error means, but most of the explanation goes right over her head.  

The hard drive is completely shot, I attached it to my external mount and couldn't get any life out of it.  So L explains that everything will be gone, and she needs to re-install her Windows partition and offers to do it for her since she had time.  Their conversation as follows is my favorite part of this story:

**L:** ""Alright so, to re-install your system I'm going to need your boot disk, basically the CD that came with your laptop when you bought it, it has the Windows installation on it, do you have that with you?""

R begins to hunt rapidly through her backpack, she's being very cooperative, but she is panicky.  She finally finds a case and pulls it out of her backpack with the biggest smile on her face, a smile of pride.  R reaches out towards us and shows us.. Microsoft Office 2010.

**R:** ""Here it is!  Thank you guys for the help!""

The poor sweet girl was trying her best, but we kept our straight faces and showed her what she needed to look for, and helped her resolve this problem.  I know this isn't at the same caliber as most of you Tech Help Gurus, but I'm a r/talesfromtechsupport virgin, so thanks for the read!

Oniryuu,3,8,1q7pih,24,"I am having a bad day, so maybe I can rectify this and make some people laugh.

I've done a lot of tech support over the years with various companies. These are just small excerpts. 

1. This was about 15 years ago while working for an ISP. Coworker in another location sends me an mp3 and I listen to it, just flabbergasted. Asked for the story. Names changed, of course. I have the mp3 around somewhere still. 

""Joe had a really rough call and was escalating fast so his supervisior started listening from his desk and.. well that happened."" 

So the conversation went as follows:

Joe: Sir, I am going to ask you one last time. If you don't stop yelling at me, I'm going to end this call.

Customer: Listen. You like sheep, I like sheep. Let's get together and make a sheep farm.

The sup started cracking up and pulled the recording, thus we ended up with that little gem.

2. While working as tech support for a cellular provider, I took a call from a customer experiencing issues with their data. As I was troubleshooting,  the customer interrupts me and begins discussing his local town.

Customer: I'm in a small town, you know. Right now, we had a midget running around town naked yelling things. It happens a lot, you know. 

I really had no idea how to reply to that. His voice was pretty creepy when he was talking about it. I just kept troubleshooting and he kept going on about it. 

3. While working for an ISP, I receive a complaint about their DSL not working. I show the order cancelled. Asked if he requested, said no. He was quite upset. Asked if any problems or changes to their landline. Said no. 

I call the telco. They tell me the CO is up and running, they can't find why it's been cancelled. More calls,  same answer.
Well, I had this escalating path I could use. Never used it, called the guy. I explain the issue. He looks into it.

""Your customer cancelled their landline then reactivated it a day later.""
He said the techs I spoke with had access to the into, not sure why they didn't see it or didn't tell me. 

Customer apparently didn't understand that cancelling their landline would kill DSL and tried to argue that it was a BS reason. He decided to go with another provider.

pacocase,0,20,1q7jkn,0,"Three warriors bravely boarded a flight out of their homeland, departing earlier than even the sun itself had even thought to come up. The security lines were naught, for our heroes knew few other travelers dare to journey at such an hour as six forty-five in the morning. One hero courageously slept most of the way after a brief respite in the land of Philadelphia. However, the other two remained alert, worried about the treachery that lie before them.

Having accomplished their first-day goals intact, shelter was the next priority after arriving in the far away land known as Los Angeles. Tired from the long day of travel, our droopy-eyed heroes made their way an inn which had outdoor hallways that reminded them of much cheaper facilities; ones they had seen before but had been too afraid to enter. This was, however, the only inn in town with vacancy, and rest was required before the next day's battle. Our heroes strengthened their resolve, bypassed the glacially slow vertical transport device, and took the stairs to their cabins for the night. 

It was soon apparent to our esteemed heroes that the days in this land are longer, as the initial day of the journey seemed never to end, and this morning had come much earlier than normal. The second day began with a long trek on unfamiliar and nonsensical trails. Our crew did manage to make sense of the trails and eventually arrive at their destination, only to be greeted by a cantankerous gatekeeper. The small warrior, having already encountered and tried the patience of this particular gatekeeper before, gave way and allowed the tallest to use his powers of persuasion to turn the would-be foe into a reluctant ally. All the while, the others made camp amongst the myriad displays of technology in this new lair where they would largely remain for duration of the journey.

The epic battle began. The BSOD's fought fiercely in the beginning; a seemingly undefeatable foe. The three warriors fought with vigor, each performing their own specialized attacks, but to no avail. There appeared to be no discernible pattern in the actions of their enemy - something our heroes had been trained to spot in their youth, undergoing years of training during the NES period. After several battles lost to the BSOD's, downtrodden and with little hope remaining, one warrior decided on an unorthodox maneuver. He would call for help, lest the gatekeeper turn on them again. Holding his communication device up to a gleaming beacon of sunlight, he summoned an entity known as Dell Tech Support.

Dell was uncooperative at first. Was the whole world against our heroes? Non-standard operating systems and video cards were flung at them as reasons for ignoring their pleas for help. Our heroes convened, placing Dell on a suspended animation spell known as ""hold."" After much internal discussion, the hold was lifted as sacred dump files were gathered and sent to Dell as an offering. As the sun set on the third day, our heroes were on the edge of exasperation. They returned to their inn with dashed spirits, nonetheless determined to try again the next day.

Much to the warriors' delight, by the next morning word had been sent! Dell had accepted their offering and from it they extracted this bit of wisdom, should our heroes choose to undertake the task: They must disable the C-States in the land of BIOS on each of the seven individual realms of the BSOD's. The short warrior, having visited the land of BIOS more than the others, was chosen for the task. He suited up for battle and disappeared for a long while. Just as the others were growing concerned enough to embark on a rescue mission, the he returned with a triumphant grin, joyfully inviting the others to provoke the BSOD's which now lied dormant, seemingly defeated. 

""Thank you, Dell Tech Support,"" The trio cried in unison.

Naturally skeptical, our heroes poked and prodded at the BSOD's for a few concurrent days to be sure the beast was truly slain. A few side quests remained, to be sure - on the last day a Winnov device was swapped for an ineffective one after a baby BSOD reared its ugly blue-and-white head. The new device successfully repelled further attacks, and there was much rejoicing by the evening of the final day of the journey. Rumors of strange incidents of frozen reality remained unproven. Our heroes regarded them largely as superstition and legend surrounding the BSOD's, as they had searched for them all week to no avail. 

The three warriors, having successfully slain the beast and turning the gatekeeper into a permanent ally, now shared a battle-hardened camaraderie that had not existed the week prior. They congratulated each other on their successes and took separate paths home, eager for further journeys of their own.",A literal tale from tech support.

CanIGetaHellYeah,254,492,1q7ilu,1543,"I was a new starter looking after a client we had taken over 6 months ago who where having lots of issues, the CEO was concerned the old IT guy was still accessing the system. I thought that was a bit crazy but strange things were happening, account lockouts, passwords changing, services being disabled, it really felt like something malicious was happening but I couldn't prove anything. 

Then it happened. One afternoon I was light on work so I decided to log into their system and have a poke around. I log onto the terminal server, look at active users.

Logged in user - Backup

Holy shit, that didn't look right. I bring over my coworker who notices that the computer name has the same initials as the company that the old IT guy was currently working for. We look at his IP and bingo, reverse dns shows he is connecting from his old work place.

Reset his password and displayed this message on his session

THIS IS AN UNAUTHORISED CONNECTION, YOUR IP _._._._ HAS BEEN LINKED TO YOUR DOMAIN __.COM.AU AND LEGAL ACTION WILL FOLLOW

Knowing his session wasn't idle I let that sit for a nice 5 seconds so he could marinate in panic and fear then disconnected his session.

Logged in and opened Outlook and he had EVERYONES mailbox connected to his with full permissions, we checked his sent items nothing .. I hit ""recover deleted items"" and hey presto, 6 months worth of emails he has been forwarding to himself OR forwarding to a women in the office who we discover he is having an affair with ! He is feeding her information from her coworkers and she was using that to her advantage.

He had forwarded other emails that I had written to the CEO assuring him the old IT guy was not logging in remotely and he had added 

""Haha these guys are fucking idiots, they have no idea. Cancelled another backup last night, do you think they will figure it out ? Morons.""

I could not believe what I was reading. I simply can not include all of the incredible things we discovered and the evidence we collected, it was the most exciting IT work I have ever done in my life. It was filled with justice and epic wins.

**Epilogue**

The CEO decided to get lawyers involved, I provided them with every scrap of data I could find and they put together this intimidating 200 page document that included itemised lists of connection times, showing he basically logged in every day while working at his new job and tampered with the system. It stated they would sue him and have him charged if he did not capitulate with the terms of the agreement.

That document was delivered to him personally, at his desk at 9am of a work day and at exactly the same time the exact same document was delivered to his boss at 9am. He was escorted out of the building at 9.20am.


Edit: Epilogue, not prologue

***Edit II: Answering some questions here***

**What happened to the girl?**

The CEO decided to review her work and discovered that she had been doing some sabotage as well, not putting in sales orders in from people she didn't like, deleting messages and saying they were never recieved and in one more serious incident she edited someones timesheet resulting in lost overtime. She had to pay the back money owed and lost her job, they could have taken legal action but my understanding was it was not a large amount.

**What where the terms and conditions?**

I wasn't privy to all the details but my client did let me know that he had to attend several depositions in which he had to answer in great detail everything he had done, surrender hard drives and other equipment that he had mentioned he had stolen and there was some kind of financial component to it as well where he had to pay costs of causing all of these issues, I think it was in the thousands, not a huge amount but for a guy without a job it was. There was some provision about not working in IT, I am not sure how legally that works but I believe he had to stay away from IT for 5 or 10 years.


**You aren't an IT detective, you're a big phony!!**

Yes, when taking on a new client all password should be rotated and the entire system should be reviewed. Unfortunately I had been working for the company for two weeks, they took on the client six months ago. I later determined that several factors went into why the system review wasn't done, time and cost constraints but mainly laziness. My coworkers had already ""looked into it"" and concluded that he ""wasn't logging in"" and told me a full password rotation was done (later I discovered it was ONLY for real peoples accounts, not service accounts). When I was given management of the client (account manager, not IT helpdesk guy) the CEO gave me a the full story and I began looking into it. 

It should also be said that my job role was account manager, I met with clients and discussed the performance of our helpdesk, their IT agreement and projects - I was not meant to do troubleshooting, that was apparently for the helpdesk tier 1-3. The jobs that came through to the helpdesk (backups cancelled, account lockouts) were treated by them as isolated issues and did not investigate further than that. All of this coalesced into a situation where everyone in my company was telling me its fine and my client is just paranoid. I didn't accept that, and found what I found. Did I use any advanced techniques ? No. The guy was sloppy as shit and anyone who is worth half their salt could have found it. I am sharing this story because it's interesting, not because I think I am a detective.


**What other evidence did you find?**

He was a prolific user of Lync and his chat logs were all stored in his user profile, he would chat throughout the day with the woman in the office and have some of the most cringe worthy interactions that were just disturbing to read. They had flashes of red hot anger, swearing at each other like two drunks at a pub followed by pathetic apologies and disgusting make up flirting. Constant bitching about others in the office. I found that this woman would contact HIM to fix IT issues, it explained why she was so hostile towards me when I met her in person. Several incidents where he was attempting to ""fix"" something, our helpdesk was also looking at the same issue and this inflamed the problems. 

He had accidentally saved some passwords to websites in his browser cache like facebook, web management site of his personal domain, some other weird forums. Couldn't do anything with these of course but it was hilarious clicking on his history and it loading straight into these sites, the audacity and gall of this guy thinking he would never get caught yet taking no steps to hide his activity. 

The most disturbing of all though was the M Night Shyamalan twist when I discovered that the old IT guy was very close to one of the owners and they had remained in contact after he was let go. He had convinced the owner that letting him go was a mistake and to watch how many problems would occur without him. He also claimed to be logging in to ""check on things"" and ""make sure backups run, that kind of thing"" (quotes from emails he wrote). He was sabotaging the system while pretending to fix things, saying that if he wasn't logging in things would be so much worse. The owner believed every word and met with him on several occasions to discuss how to deal with the situation.  The CEO was furious upon this discovery and went to the other owners who decided to use this opportunity to push him out of the business.

OldPolishProverb,9,22,1q7hye,28,"Pull up your chairs children and gather round the desktop-on-fire screensaver while Mr. Proverb tells you a story from the days of the distant past, back in the early 80's. Days when Dinosaurs were not yet extinct, merely confined to nature preserves and Kingdoms still ran their day to day operations on the big iron of mainframe computers; or in this case on a couple of mid-range VAX’s. 

Once upon a time there was a kingdom where all users shared equally in the magic big iron boxes. Peons and nobles of the kingdom took turns seeking the knowledge held within the magical big iron boxes, sharing of their time with others as they went along their daily strife.  All one had to do was dip a magic mirror (dumb terminal actually, (think really primitive thin client)) into the enchanted stream of the flowing network and you were granted an audience with the mighty iron that held the holy business databases. These sacred tombs were guarded by the keepers of the IT in their own special climate controlled chambers. 

All were equal in their quest for answers from the magic iron boxes, as the great ones tirelessly responded to all requests one by one. Not all knowledge was given to anyone who asked, for the keepers of IT knew that this would lead to madness, but all were equal in their quest to seek the truth, or gain access to the third quarter gross sales totals, whatever was more important to them. 

But low and behold there came one day a challenger to the set order, a young man, trained in the ways of the spreadsheet and the business plan. He came forth from the wilds of the lands of Academia, all bright and shiny.  He was indentured as squire to the Chief of Officers (CEO.)  Honored at being chosen, he rose up to the tasks of this noble calling and toiled mightily in the quests assigned to him. Rewarded for his efforts he soon accompanied his chief before the royal court that did own the kingdom. Soon he was being assigned tasks by owner/ruler of the kingdom himself.    

Now the IT guardians were vigilant in their protection of the magic iron boxes.  They knew that they were old and powerful and could be temperamental.  But if treated with respect, deference and patience they were happy in to perform their duties. They would faithfully produce ever bountiful reams of knowledge printed upon massive amounts of continuous paper. The pages were needed to serve the entire kingdom to the benefit and profit of all, come day in and day out. 

Ah but the new squire cared not for the needs of the others in the kingdom, for he felt himself aloof.  He had been tasked by the powerful Chief of Officers and the great owners themselves! He stormed the gates of the IT and demanded private audience with the great magic iron boxes.  The IT guardians explained that if he were to wait his turn like all others his query would be answered in due time. No he proclaimed. He had been tasked by the Chief of Officers and the great and powerful Owner/King himself! All others must wait behind him.

The chief guard of the IT realized he had no choice but to consent when faced with an order of the great ones. The IT guards cleared the chambers of all others, in many cases stopping or cancelling other quests that had already been given permission to proceed. Amid the grumblings and complaints of the many the squire now had a private audience with the magic iron boxes. Soon he emerged, triumphant in his quest for knowledge. Heavily laden with printouts he went upon his merry way.  Gleefully he returned to his the royal court with the fruits of his quest. The guardians of IT sighed heavily with relief at the departure of the squire.  They then turned back to their relentless task of appeasing the temperaments of the magic iron boxes and now to the lower members of the court whose days had been turned into disarray. At least we don’t have to go through that again they all thought. How wrong they were. 

Embolden by his triumphs he took on more quests. Some were tasked of him, but many other were of his own devising. By showing his cleverness he hoped to be looked upon with favor by the royal house and awarded with riches and position. Time and again he disrupted the daily proceedings if the IT guardians and threw into frenzy the affairs of others. The guardians asked, argued and pleaded with the squire to let them schedule a time with the magic iron boxes so that they would be ready to receive him as well as not inconvenience others.  He would hear none of this since he had now been dubbed “Golden” by the royal court. He invoked the names of the CEO and the Owner/King whenever questioned about his quests. He questioned their loyalty to the crown and threatened the crown’s wrath upon them if he did not get his way.  With heaviness of heart they relented. Time passed and as the scene played out over and over again. While the golden one was able to produce results many others soon fell farther and farther behind. There was turmoil in the kingdom as department goals and project deadlines fell by the wayside like leaves in the autumn.

Eventually, the CEO finally started to notice troubles in the kingdom. Not being a perfect fool, for who among us is perfect? He soon realized that the problem was coming from the land of IT.  In a rare moment of insight he felt the need to confer with the keepers of IT about these problems.  So he left his home in the high country of the corner office of the castle and sallied forth, seeking the chief of IT.  

As he approached from afar the quarters of the IT chief he heard words of rage spilling out from the chief’s lair. To his amazement it was his golden one! He was unleashing epithets most foul and vulgar upon the chief of IT. He stopped and stood in the shadows to listen. To his shock he heard his own name used to call forth fire and brimstone upon the cowering chief.  He heard his chief beg for a delay from the golden so that their regular duties could proceed. He said that he could arrange a private audience with the magic iron late in the evening when he could ask his questions to his heart’s content.  No! He replied. He wanted things his way and he wanted them NOW! He then called upon the name of the Owner/King and said to make it so!  The Chief of Officers quietly entered the chambers behind the golden one and quietly said, “No” to his astonished squire.  “Come with me.” He said to the white faced squire. Dejected and forlorn he silently followed his master to the high lands of corner offices. 

No one knows exactly what happened behind those closed doors that day. What we do know is that a new squire emerged, chastened and humble.  He also seemed to flinch whenever he had to sit down, as if in pain. He still had his quests, but they were smaller and farther between.   More importantly they were done under the watchful eye of the chief of IT who reported on the squire and the results of his quest to the CEO. Deference was given to the keepers of the magical big iron. And a cautious piece once again settled upon the kingdom.

piercedRichard,13,12,1q7ciz,65,"This happened a little over a year ago, so some details may be off/fuzzy. Sorry...

I was working at a 100-person marketing company in Minnesota as the second IT person (myself and my boss were it), not including the developers. We changed the name of the company around 8 years back, but the AD domain was set up under the old name. We wanted to change this. My boss wanted to start fresh - New domain, new Exchange servers... Not a problem - A lot of work, but not a problem. Or so I thought. 

He hired a ~60 year old guy as a contractor, who was very nice at first. He and I talked quite a bit and we both worked on issues together for a few months. When the fan had began to drown in excrement, he started complaining to my boss that I was screwing things up because I didn't like him. I liked him until around two months after that when my boss told me about his comments for the previous few months.  

The guy seemed to know his stuff pretty well in the first several meetings I had with him. Then again, I hadn't touched a fair amount of what we'd be changing. He started to recommend that we add additional things, like imaging every machine (in one weekend, mind you), rewriting group policy from scratch (in Word, not writing a policy we could look at using RSOP or GPMC). My boss wanted it, and I went along. It sounds like a good plan, except that it's a lot of changes very quickly. 

**The Project**

This was supposed to be a 120-day project - He was supposed to be done with the migration at 90 days, but that didn't happen. He spent 90 days writing pretty simple group policies (In word, not using GPMC or any other tool except to get the descriptions and titles, which he then typed out). He spent another 40 days or so working on an image for our imaging - I had already created an image, which took me 3 days while I was still doing support. It was really basic stuff - Windows 7 Pro x64, Office 2007 x32, and Firefox. That's it. MAK keys for Office and Windows. Really basic stuff, but he wanted to add local group policy elements, and tweak the settings (Company logo, basic stuff again). 

It became pretty obvious to me that he was just milking us for time. He was fired from his previous job for undisclosed reasons. His work ethic gave me a clue - We all surf the web (or write on Reddit) when working, but he seemed to do every single task as slow as possible.  More on that at the end. He had a desk right next to me, and most commonly was writing newsletters for his family or whathaveyou. 

**""You don't have to worry about your job""**

He and I went out to lunch a few times, and we were very friendly. I asked him if he's going to continue his business after his contract expires (He was looking for a full-time position as well). He looked at me dumbfounded. Completely dumbfounded. His response: ""You don't have to worry about your job - I think we'll make a great team"". I didn't worry about my job, but I knew we were looking for a Systems Engineer, but the requirements were well above what this man had (Masters, BS in CS, CCNA/CCNP, MCE...). 

**And it starts**

My boss gave him a final, hard deadline to be ready to image and migrate, which he kind of made. We imaged every machine in the company in around 20 hours (actually I did most of it - My boss was working on migrating mailboxes, and the contractor was updating the group policy, for almost all of the two days). I put in around 50 hours from Friday until Sunday. Not a good weekend. 

Issues became apparent almost right away - We weren't getting all group policies cleanly applied, and some major issues occurred. We tried to fix it for around three days, then the contractor said that I was screwing with the policy (which I made no changes to the policy), so my boss yelled at me. I did nothing with the issues for the new systems for the next three weeks, as instructed very clearly to do so. **My boss's temper was getting shorter and shorter, and I was the brunt of the outbursts** due to the stress of the project going very badly. This was 4 weeks after we were supposed to be finished, around 4 months after this guy's contract was supposed to be over. 

**""Quit touching me"" - ""I'm not in the office right now...""**

The contractor complained consistently that I was messing with things that I didn't touch, and that the fixes I was doing on a system-by-system basis were screwing with his tests, and that I was a child (Yes, I was 26 years old then, but I had run a pretty successful MSP business for the last ~7 years with some very stuffy clients). He and I didn't talk during this period, at all. Only the sparse e-mail to let him know what I was doing on every system. Then came his snarky replies that I just ignored. 


**Rules are meant to be broken**

I finally decided to break the rules, in a very careful way, to do a well researched test. I had been telling my boss and the contractor a few times that changes to the Default Domain Policy weren't working (Microsoft recommends that you don't change it, because there is a SID issue with all of them), and the combined computer/user policy wasn't working correctly. Basically computer policy was being applied to the user, not the computer, and loopback doesn't work that way. I got yelled at a lot for just mentioning it, because the contractor said it wasn't possible to do it without Loopback processing. 

So I tested it - I took a spare computer, made one superficial change to a group policy (wrote a registry key using Prefereneces) that was applied to an existing test user that I had created before we migrated. It didn't work. Then I moved that computer to the same Users OU, and tried again. It worked, immediately. I tested with a live system and a live user, and it worked immediately. Sweet - I fixed it. 


**The meeting that became a confrontation**

So the next morning I called a meeting with my boss and the contractor, and explained the test, the results, and counter tests I performed as well to make sure it wasn't just a fluke. I even tested it in a bare, freshly-imaged machine and it worked on the second login (since computer GP doesn't process on the first login for a new machine, I wasn't worried). The contractor tried to poke holes, interrupting me every few words with why my test was invalid. My boss blew up at me - ""Are you prepared for the consequences if this breaks something?"" ""Yes, yes I am. I just want it to be fixed.""

All huffy, the contractor demanded to see this in action, so we took over a live user's computer, verified the superficial registry entry wasn't on the system, then logged in with my test user. It worked. 

**""See, you're stoopid. And fat. And a doodie head""**

Not good enough - The contractor put another computer in the same OU as my test, then ran the test (without my boss and I present). He came over and ushered me in, and asked my boss to join him. He explained what he had done, and that it didn't work. I asked if he forced replication, he had not. We forced replication twice, and restarted the computer, and it worked. 

**Sobbing**

He worked on a new ""solution"" to our problems, and I went back to my work. I was talking with my boss near the end of the day, when he came in and told me ""Don't mess with the policies. What you did today was really messy and can cause huge issues"", to which I replied ""Uh huh, ok"". He started crying, ran out of the building. 

**""I need to do more ... Um ... What do they try to exchange for money? Time? Yes, Time""**

We make the changes in the following days, and come Monday everything is working much, much better. After another month of ""fixing"" the group policies (and writing at least 4 more newsletters), he decides that we need to reformat all of the machines at our remote office. Sure, they could use a reformat. He volunteers to do it, and spent 5 days reformatting 11 machines, around a half-mile from our office (in the same complex). 

I went up there to fix a few issues, and each time he had his feet up and was reading from his Kindle, while the screen in front of him was waiting for him to click Next. I asked the manager from that group if he's working, and she very candidly said ""No, he just reads his kindle and does something online"". As soon as I show, he suddenly moves quite quickly, and is now working on multiple machines at a time. 

**The end**

Whatever - I shoot an e-mail to my boss to let him know (he was out sick for that week), but take no other action. I don't talk to him, I don't care anymore. We don't renew his contract for another month. Our 4 month project turns into a 10+ month one pretty quickly with this guy. I clean up the remaining issues, and just do my job in general. 

We hire an excellent Systems Engineer, but just before my boss said ""Now you *have* to get along with him""... Not a good sign. I had worked at the company for a few years, and never had a problem with anyone (including other contractors and potential superiors). He and I get along really well - I like just about everything about him (nothing worth complaining about at all), and we both help each other a lot. 

**Parting is such sweet sorrow**

A month later, I get fired for screwing up the migration project. No bull - I truly didn't do anything to screw it up. I only took action after we were starting to get the bad attention of our CEO, and that action worked (thankfully). 

**Eh, not so much sorrow at all**

I already had an interview scheduled with Robert Half for the week after I was fired, so I just moved it up to the next day(Friday). I interviewed with a few other recruiters Monday through Wednesday. I had my first interview on Thursday, one week after my termination. The first interview didn't go incredibly well - Called Gary, the interviewer, Greg when I met him, and couldn't explain how to troubleshoot an IP printer not printing. I sent an e-mail to my recruiter to forward to Gary, thanking him for taking the time to interview me. I got a call no less than an hour later offering me the job, for 40% more than my previous job, at a good company, where I've now been for two years. I started at the company 10 days after being fired.

Xyrqurqualym,17,21,1q6va4,81,"Ahoy /r/talesoftechsupport!

She struck again. My phone rang. The Meekrosoft Mother called. And I now know why tech support for her is such a chore and a seemingly impossible task that makes grown men weep and destroys all souls in a ten mile radius. And it's the reason why tech support for family is so difficult. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have discovered it. The reason for all my worries.

You don't know the Meekrosoft Mother? Well, here's the short version. She's my mother and she's not too good with computers. Everything she has on her computer is either Foxfire Google or Meekrosoft. Occasionally, rarely, there's Torts, too. That does movies. A while ago, I installed TeamViewer on her laptops (she has two these days) so that I can remote into her machines and fix stuff.

This has, however, backfired somewhat since I have to teach her the nature, function and launching of TeamViewer every time, followed by her screaming bloody murder when the remote connection works and her ""Meekrosoft does things on its own!"" So I try to use it as little as possible. This brings us to my current tale.

**Meekrosoft Mother**: My computer doesn't work!

**Xyrqurqualym**: Which one?

**MM:** The one in the kitchen.

Oh, we're off to a great start. While I did set up her second computer, I don't know which computer she put where. Oh joy...

**X:** Which one's that?

**MM:** It's got Meekrosoft.

**X:** Is it the new one or the old one?

**MM:** How should I know?

See, this would be a fair question. However, I made sure she could tell them apart. Let's start with the obvious. The old machine is black. The new one is white. Let's continue with the less obvious. One has a desktop image of Marilyn Monroe, the new one has one of the town she grew up in. For all intents and purposes, there's no way she could confuse them.

I ask, she tells me it's the new one, because...

**MM:** How the hell am I supposed to know which one's new?

**X:** Uh... right. Now, what's wrong with it?

So here's the weird thing. This happened two days ago and I can't for the life of me remember what it was because not only was it something that could be fixed with two clicks, but also because of the thing that is about to happen in this story blew my mind.

**X:** Oh, that one. Right. Click Button #1 and then Button #2. That will take care of it.

**MM:** What? Where!? How?

**X:** Do you see Button #1? Click on that, then a window pops up and Button #2 shows up. Then click that.

**MM:** I see it.

**X:** Click it.

At this point, I am rather unnerved. How can something this simple be such a big exercise? Seriously...

But from the sound of the phone, it sounds okay. I hear clicking. Granted, I've stopped counting after about five clicks and she makes no effort to stop clicking, muttering things like ""Okay... here."" and ""Now, this."" She seems busy enough. After about fifteen seconds of frantic clicking, I wonder what's taking so long. 

**X:** Uh... 

**MM:** I'm busy!

**X:** Doing what? This is literally two clicks. 

**MM:** I'm clicking!

**X:** You see Button #1, yes?

**MM:** Yes.

**X:** Did you click it?

**MM:** No.

Hold up. Why am I even bothering? Goddamnit. You know this meme that goes ""You had one job...""? She had one button to click. One. Not more. One. And instead of clicking that one button, she frantically clicks around the screen for half a minute.

**X:** Wha... why not?

**MM:** I'm fixing it!

**X:** No, you're not. I told you to click that one thing. I told you to just use your frickin' mouse and click the fuck on that one fucking button. And you click on everything but that one button?

**MM:** Yes.

There you go. Here's why family tech support is such a hard task.

**tl;dr:** Meekrosoft Mother had one job, fails spectacularly. She clicks all the things, but not the one thing she should click.

Hopefully it's close enough for you guys to get a laugh out of it. I do software development, but I know how to do tech support and this felt like tech support to me.

**Background Info**

In the last year, I've been getting into Monster Hunter. Particularly Monster Hunter 3 for the Wii U and 3DS. Well, this particular game has the option to transfer your saved game back and forth between the two versions. You use a utility on the 3DS to basically cut and paste the save to the Wii U or vice versa. The 3DS works with SD card like games which save data directly on the game's card.

**Story**

Bob, Aaron and I were on Skype preparing to hunt us some monsters and we were just waiting on Bob to transfer his save so we can play on the Wii U. He goes in and opens up the utility only to be told he has no saved game. Well. That's not quite right, I played with him before, so what the hell?

So we go through troubleshooting the thing with me walking him through the process, even having me transfer my saves back and forth a few times so I can walk him through each screen of the process in real time. We go back and forth for close to an hour trying to figure out what fresh hell this is. Finally this exchange takes place.

&gt;Me: ""Ok, know what? Can you load up the game on the 3DS and check that your save isn't corrupted or something?""

&gt;Bob: ""\*sigh\* *OK*... Just give me a second, I have to go get it.""

*Silence fills the Skype call for a brief moment, the gears turning in my head at what he just said.*

&gt;Bob: ""Ok, I've got it, one sec while it-""

*Talking over each other:*

&gt;Aaron: ""Wait, Bob, wait..."" Me: ""Hang on, hold that thought, Bob...""

&gt;Bob: ""Yeah, what?""

&gt;Me: ""What did you mean when  you said you had to 'go get it'? Did you not have it IN the system?""

&gt;Bob: "".... no.... Do I need to have the game in the gameboy?""

*Laughter from Aaron and I erupts over Skype. Once we finish...*

&gt;Me: ""Yes, Bob. You do need to have THE ACTUAL DAMN GAME in the gameboy to access the save game...""

So, he plugs the card into the 3DS, goes to the utility and transfers the data first try. We then proceed to mock him for the rest of the night. 

And yes, he's an experienced 'gamer' who's been playing 3DS games as long as the 3DS has been around. He's also a college grad that's worked tech support for an ISP before.

**TL;DR;** - Is it plugged in?

*Edit* - Bob read this story and wanted me to not use his real name, so anonymized. Also, he wants it to be known he thought the saves were saved to the 3DS itself and not the cards. ","Oh, It Needs To Be Plugged In?",65

sadak5,3,15,1q6mzz,20,"Little boys and girls of TFTS, gather one more time to laugh about users way of thinking (or the absence of it).

This time, I brought you a new tale. One of Love, passion and... nah, just users not-so-logical behaviour.

After moving to my apartment (the one I mentioned in a previous tale), my boss started to be less mean (in a 1 to 10 scale, he change from 12 to 11), and some times we chatted about the experiences of living in brand new apartment by yourself.

Was during one of this chats that this history unfolded.

We usually monitored the traffic flow of orders to the Mexican stock exchange, and having more than 600 transactions going to the exchange, we cannot check each of them manually, so we put a self designed monitoring tool that rang every time an order was rejected by the exchange. While some rejections are critical, the majority of them are because user error. so, we changed behaviour to send emails instead of rang in some cases.

In this tale, there are 3 main characters, and 1 support character. Those are CLU (as in clueless) for user1, CLUB (as in Clueless Boss) is boss user, BOSS is my boss, A is a co-worker (the one of my first tale, support) and, of course, me.

Well, around 10 am local time of a Thursday, CLUB called BOSS to his cubicle (CLUB and CLU are cramped in an area the size of an office, with 2 more of CLUB people and around 8 PC's and 10 monitors).

When CLUB returned, he asked us to check why and order of CLU was not executed (CLUB and his people cannot process the difference of a rejection to an order sent and expired because no execution). We proceed to check and found it was rejected with a unknown code. BOSS calls CLUB ant tells him the order was rejected. CLUB tells BOSS to come to his place again.

Meanwhile, we don't check the rejection cause, because 99.999999999999999% of CLUB and people rejections are because PBCAK causes.

B returns, telling us that CLUB yelled at him because CLUB demanded to know why it was rejected, as he sent the order correctly.

As requested (I had a personal vendetta against CLUB, because he harassed my SO a lot when her worked in CLUB group, and because mainly he had a personal grudge against me, even to the point he openly declared that he hated me to some co-workers of her and my SO), I started to search all the history related to this specific order (message we received, the one we sent to the exchange and each response from the exchange and our system).

While doing this, I found that CLUB didn't actually sent the order (I was expecting this, because 1) Users always lie and 2) this specific user tends to lie to put himself above anyone, even sometimes his boss) but was CLU (another liar). When I'm about to search the rejection code in our printed old and mysterious codex (exchange spec), I found the message of the rejection. Basically, the message was telling the the order was sent for more shares than the ones the company had in the exchange. I was WTF!, and asking myself if this user actually meant to send this order size. A was puzzled to, as he helped me to find the order size. this was

At the same time, BOSS returned to tell us that we checked the rejection message, but this time he was trying to contain a laugh. We tell him we already found, and what was the size of the order. He then proceed to tell what he found according to this rejection message (that was promptly displayed in CLUB exchange provided console, and CLU exchange read-only console), and the declarations of CLUB, U. And some body odours (relevant).

What BOSS found is along this: CLU system (developed by us) provided a quick sending order, that when you double clicked a price or volume, the ticket for the order was pre-filled with the data of that offer. Then, CLU proceeds to replace the volume with the desired one. But here was the error. He didn't highlighted the data to replace it or not even erased it. he clicked the end of the value and typed his value, causing the order size to be around 7 million shares (the company only had around 70 thousand shares, and the offers where maximum of 700 because the stock price). Then, CLU not checks the value again and send the order.

CLUB and CLU faces where red because the shame, and were unable to talk back anything when BOSS asked if this was the case. A the end, they received a warning of BOSS boss that is also CLUB boss' boss and one of the share holders of the company.

And the body odour part? CLUB and CLU had a very strong (I can tell you, very is at least, modest) alcohol stench. With red eyes and some sleepless faces. CLU even fell asleep around 12 PM that day.

Tuesday rolls around, my cellphone buzzes me awake. My boss is telling me that the websites and email and printing are down, oh noooo!

I walk him through resetting our win2k3 server. He actually manages to mess it up twice, I don't even know, it resets the same as any PC in the office.

The websites come up, hooray! Email and printing are still down, boo! I tell him I'll come in to look at it on Wednesday. I get at least 4 more calls for things that can be fixed with a functioning brain.

Wednesday rolls around, I'm waiting outside for 20 minutes before he shows up to unlock. He takes me to a computer to show me the problem. He opens up our accounting software, tries to print, and it spits out an error. Report files could not be accessed.

While he's showing me, he tells me how he ran some diagnostics himself and had to enter a captcha for our email and he thinks that's the problem. He opens a sales order and clicks ""email"", another error occurs trying to convert the order into a PDF. Report files could not be accessed.

There's two ways to convert a sales order into a PDF. One involves clicking ""export"" and then clicking ""as PDF."" The other involves clicking ""email"" and then closing the dialog box that pops up asking for the email address to send it to. My boss does the latter.

In his mind, not being able to print in a single program and not being able to convert an order into a PDF by clicking ""email"" means ""email and printing are both down."" I should have realized this sooner, I guess. The best part? It's ONLY on this computer that it's happening. These functions work fine on 5 out of 6 office PCs.

When I explained to him that the problem was that this PC was losing access to the network share that has the accounting report templates, he says to me, ""Then why did I have to type in that Chinese garbage on our email?""

SirEDCaLot,177,219,1q6l3c,878,"I have a simple rule: if the work I'm doing is not appreciated and valued by my those I work with and for, I leave.  The people I work with and for all value my efforts, but I wasn't always this way.  Contained herein is an expensive but useful lesson.

-----

**Story Time**- gather 'round old EDC and listen good

One of my first IT jobs was where I learned that lesson. It was a small company, I started out under two other people doing shitty desktop support. Over time those two people quit and I was left running the whole show but still only getting paid for desktop support. I asked for a raise but was told ""What, just for fixing our computers? That's what you've always been doing and (the guys that quit) were WAY overpaid!"" I stayed for several years though- I didn't it mind that much, I just kept my head down.

Our setup was ancient. When WinXP hit SP1, our servers still ran NT 3.51 (the one with the Windows 3.1 interface) and the desktops ran pirated Win2k. The backup was a squeaky DDS drive (literally- it squeaked when the tape backhitched) and the backup software was installed from floppy discs. I practically begged them to upgrade, but was always denied. The boss drove around in a brand new Benz, but any money for upgrades was out of the question.

One day, server crashes. It was probably a virus, everybody had the admin password (""we have no secrets in this office!"") and used the server for stupid shit. Either way, server OS is totally borked. Naturally half the squeaky DDS tapes don't work, which didn't matter because the floppy discs with the backup software are full of bad sectors. And I can't get them replaced because that company went out of business back when NT4 was the next best thing.

I put in a FUCK TON of overtime fixing it, but I did fix it. Took the better part of a week and a whole weekend, but between reinstalling NT3.51, finding an old 'warez' (remember that word?) of the backup software on IRC, stripping the DDS drive and cleaning the heads with q-tips, restoring the backup, removing the traces of the virus before they could activate, etc etc I got *every last byte of data back* for those guys. They were down a couple days, but lost *nothing*. I was very proud of myself and expected at least some gratitude, because if they lost all their data they'd pretty much have to fold the company.

Instead, boss refuses to pay for ANY of the time I spent fixing the server. His justification- ""You broke it, we lost money while it was down, I shouldn't have to pay you for fixing it."" Nevermind that I did NOT break it and was in fact in my car at the time and it was down for a week because he ignored my recommendations about good backups. He refused to pay for ANY of my hours fixing his server.

Shortly after that, I quit and was almost instantly hired by one of his clients for double the pay. I offered to take my two weeks updating the documentation at the old place and helping with a transition plan, but the boss said no thanks just don't come back in on Monday.

**Moral of the story- if you aren't being valued, leave while you can. A workplace that doesn't value your services will bite you in the ass sooner or later.**

Karma justice- I had to stop by a few weeks later to give back my RFID entry card (as they had no idea how the door locks worked or how to delete an old card). They'd just hired the cheapest support company they could find, and between onsite support (which they needed constantly) and useless transfer-to-India phone support, they were now paying more than triple what they'd paid me and were getting shitty service- always a different tech, none of whom knew the quirks of their duct taped ghetto-rigged system. Two of the workers there had ""Windows NT Server for Dummies"" books on their desks. I laughed, wished them all the best, and walked out the door with a giant smile on my face.

This should make connecting a new device to the network a breeze for her in future. Also only save the password on one of the computers, in an obscure folder, to be safe.

  * I find out the above on one visit and reset the router to factory default, ISP had already given her a serviceable network name and password written on a dozen stickers and cards, so I use that... Apparently butthurt cousin is quick to inform grandmother that her now usable network is ""no longer secure"". Shaken, she calls me up and asks if ""Children can log on with their iPhones"".

12-12-93,19,31,1q673t,189,"We’re setting up an office in country 2 and I figure, first things first: we need a gateway to gateway tunnel. We hire a contractor from a MSP in country 2 to set the infrastructure in place physically as well as ssh and telnet for remote support and configuration. I’m tasked with having to work with this godforsaken clown of a contractor to set up the tunnel and get things in motion. 


I spend hours meticulously planning a solution for the second country including two domain controllers, Cisco 800 series router, a 48-port PoE Cisco switch, 10TB NAS with DFS rsync scripts to NAS in country 1 as well as a PABX and miscellaneous equipment all within budget. I even get into the gritty details of VLANs on interfaces for the switch. I send him an email with my carefully crafted network map, router/firewall /VPN tunnel encryption configurations including cost breakdowns etc etc. It was a gorgeous plan and I was proud of my work! 


I’m waiting. I’m waiting. One week later this snot stirrer has the audacity to dismiss my entire beautiful scheme and implement a solution without my discretion. He puts in a home-fucking-router with two x16 port switches for  ~40 host interface connections. So with some of the budget blown, I find somewhere to compromise on the budget in order to upgrade the router and switch. 


It’s a small operation to start; they can work with 1-2TB for now, I’ll cut back on the NAS. He installs and configures the router &amp; switch. Then he installs the new NAS and security camera but doesn’t bother to connect either of them to the local network. Ugh, fine I’ll ask a colleague in country 2 if they could just plug it in.


So Mr. Contractor leaves country 2 and starts doing further ‘configurations’ remotely. In his first email back to me after nearly 2 weeks of no-show does he send me a wall-of-text essay. Can you guess what it was about? It wasn’t about my network schema, not about my proposed solution, not a reply to the god-knows-how-many-other-emails-I-sent-asking-where-the-hell-he-had-been. 


Instead, he sends me an essay on why the VPN tunnel encryption configuration I suggested cannot be implemented and CC’s the MD in charge of our company at country 2. He goes deep into how it has been broken by the NSA according to Snowden, and that if we implemented it then the NSA would be spying on us. He goes on further explaining in absurd detail how block and stream ciphers work, ECP/ECC cryptography and cipher strengths with mathematical formulas in the email. My response in two lines:


&gt; “The least of the US’ NSA’s concerns are spying on us. We’re a company trading IT infrastructure here, not drugs. Reconfigure according to…” 


..and I spilled out a config using DH 5 so he wouldn’t be so paranoid. After 2 days I finally get another response from him telling me that the VPN tunnel didn’t work when he tried to initiate with the MD CCd in. I run through a typical checklist: are the end-point subnets right? PFS enabled? UDP 500 &amp; TCP 1723? Etc etc…


No response. 

Hello? I’ve tried initiating myself from country 1 and I’m getting rejected at P2/IPsec level. 

Are you there? 

Two-days later he tells me he’s reconfigured and tried again but with no luck establishing, again with the friggin MD CC’d. Pretty much all email exchanges from here on have the MD CC’d in, we’re not that big of a company but it was odd.


I go over with a colleague the configuration religiously on my router to be 100% sure it’s not a problem on our end. We spot nothing. 

I go back to him requesting the SSH/telnet credentials so I can just do it myself. Like the plague, he avoids handing me over details, not just the router’s ssh/telnet but also access to the PABX, printer, domain controllers and other equipment. After persisting and persisting for access details he writes back to me saying he still had no luck getting the VPN going. Screw it, I’ll call him and we’ll troubleshoot over the phone.


So I call him and, sounding frustrated he tells me how my lack of communication gives him the impression that I don’t want to work with him. He then proceeds to tell me that if I want physical support in country 2 then I’m going to have to look it up in a phone directory .*beep*. What the..? The bastard hangs up on me.


The MD then forwards me an email from him, subject titled “Have a laugh”. In the forwarded email was the contractor outlining my incompetence and inexperience. He also noted that I may feel threatened by him due to him being older and ‘much more experienced’ which would explain my ‘communication issues’. What surprised me was when he said, 

&gt; ""I was under the impression that I would be providing remote support for country 1 and country 2 on an ongoing basis and as a security measure I cannot hand out the access details to the administrator who we are replacing.""

Now I was pissed. So straight away on the phone with the MD and he tells me to disengage and that he’ll take care of it. 

Next day, first email at 9am is from the contractor with access details to everything. Immediately after is an email from our MD asking me to check access to everything. 

SSH in? Yep. 

PABX? Yep. 

DCs? Yep.

I ssh into the router and spot the VPN problem almost instantly. The moron didn't even enable IPsec policy. I re-enabled it, unblocked udp 500 on firewall, reset IPsec timers. Done. Within 20 minutes of the contractor emailing me the details had I fixed it and replied with the MD CC’d: 

&gt; “VPN tunnel is now up and running. The issue was with country 2’s router and I am more than happy to share the CLI history including changes I made to get it up and running.” 


Weeks of troubleshooting this VPN and arguing with this guy, listening to his poor attitude towards me and here it was, working because of my fixes. Goes to show how much my ‘inexperience’ compares to his ‘experience’. 


While I was writing that email back to him, all I could think was how much a jackass he must look like now in front of our MD. The same MD he tried to suck up to, undermine me in front of and attempt to make me redundant so his company could step in as a MSP. Don’t you dare try to throw me under a bus by calling me incompetent because I’m younger and less ‘experienced’. You can't replace me. Bitch.

Following that email I haven’t had any replies from him. I imagine him sitting at his desk behind his laptop smearing shit on the walls in anger knowing that someone far, far younger than him and apparently less experienced had beaten him at his own game. I wasn’t going to give him the pleasure of knowing what he’d done wrong in the router config. If he wanted to know he would have to write back and bear more embarrassment.

My friend Bob goes to a university where they bill you for Internet by each GB used. To add to that, the pricing is progressive. The first 10GB is $1/GB, the next 10GB is $2/GB, etc. This scale is not linear, and gets ridiculous once you cross the 30GB line. The scale resets every month. So naturally, students don't use a lot of data. Piracy is next to nil, and even Netflix will cost you quite a bit.

One day, Bob calls me about his internet. He says he used 40GB in 2 weeks, and can't afford to use more. He wants to know if he can use my internet. I explain how I can't do that since I don't have ""my internet"" that I can give him, but ask how he used 40GB in the first place. I know Bob, and Bob is not a very computer literate man. Bob is one of those people that never downloaded a song in his life. His main use for the internet is Facebook. I ask if he did anything unusual this month, and he says no. Since I live near by his dorm, I offer to see if I can help him by rigging his phone as a hot spot. He never uses anything close to his 4GB data plan, it's only for 2 weeks, and Android will stop him if he somehow goes over 4GB.

After I enable the hot spot, I ask him to open the laptop for me. Bob starts entering a long password, complaining about hackers. I ignore that, but decide to sift through his browser anyway because curiosity. I open Chrome and see a login page. I ignore it and type in ""antivirus"" on the address bar just to look like I'm doing actual work, but I'm returned to the login page. Bob explains he needs to login for the internet to work.

Here's where it gets interesting. The page is not encrypted. It does not use HTTPS. I look at the source for the login page and I see no Flash, Java, Java Script, anything. It is a pure HTML page with a form using POST to another unsecured location. There is no extra addon software for accessing the network. The authentication is done by sending a cookie containing his ID and password....in plain text....for each request. By each request, I mean every request his browser makes. His wifi is set not to use encryption. I ask him if he read the Windows warning that says others can see his data on an unsecured network. Bob says his IT department told him it's fine since all sites use their own security nowadays. The campus wifi is not secured either.

So my money is on some kid with wireshark stealing his credentials. Bob was right.

Did I mention this is a pretty famous top tier university?

I work for a medical care company and even in our modern times faxes are still the norm.  
Fortunately our faxes coming in and are converted to PDF's.  

So I ticket comes in saying that faxes sent from the on call laptop was sending out blurry PDF's and was a bit troubling over the weekend.  
I remoted in and took a look and found that they were blurry but suggested that they must have started out that way from the sender as either being sent from a old fax machine or was a copy of a fax.  But the girl was insistent that they weren't and they look fine coming in and downloaded a new fax and I forwarded it to myself and it did look fine.
So since I normally head to their office every couple days I said I would check it out when I was in again to what was happening.  

So when I was over a couple days ago I checked the laptop and didn't see anything wrong and it would send perfectly legible PDF's.  
I then had the secretary show me what she normally did to send faxes out.  She when proceeded to open the PDF from the web mail access and it opens fine in Adobe but then she uses PrimoPDF to ""print"" the fax and save it to the Documents folder and then send it out.  
It is strange that it was blurry but it was and so then I proceeded to show her how to use Save As... and not have to deal with ""printing"" them out again.",Why Are Digital Faxes Blurry?,51
Gambatte,10,9,1q5i1i,38,"I was working away this morning when I received a phone call from a subcontractor. He required a specific form in order to keep the paperwork rolling, but was unable to locate one on the company website.

Okay, I think, he either doesn't have a log in to the secure area, or he's forgotten his password. In either situation, it's always faster for me to pull the document from the network drive and email it to him (it's a faxed form, so generally the sub-contractor will print it once, copy it a bazillion times and fax each one back).

File not found. I knew this was too easy.

I dig a bit deeper and find the original, non-customized form (a scan of the sample from the relevant documentation, so basically identical to the custom form except for the lack of a company logo). I fire that off to the sub-contractor and start digging deeper.

After some discussion, I discover that the last person to have worked on the file accidentally deleted it, but didn't say anything at the time. Yes, this was months ago; so we're way past what backups could possibly recover. /headdesk

Somehow, it falls to me to generate this file anew, seeing as I already have the sample to work from. A couple of hours of transposing some very fine print later (which I'm sure comes through the fax brilliantly every time), it's ready to go. I create a PDF and go to put it up on the company website.

Hmmm... The password to upload the file is not working.

And I dig deeper.

The whole website is different from the last time I was in there.

The CEO happens to walk past and I snag him.

&gt; ME: What's up with the company website?

&gt; CEO: Looks good, right? I got a call from this guy who re-did the whole website a month or so back for only $1k! And he's hosting it for us too; saved the company a bundle.

I got the accounting info later, it's saving the company less than $5 a month from the previous hosting company. The CEO wastes more money than that every single day when he spends 15 minutes talking to whoever is in earshot about how he's going to [buy himself a boat](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/431/312/67e.jpg) soon.

So I get hold of the new hosting company, get the passwords and get into the company website. First thing I notice: there's some weirdness going on, there's a link to a CSS file but most of the styles are being declared in the page source. Well, that's unusual, but not my concern.

I upload the file and am adding a link to it inside the secure area when I receive an email.

&gt; CEO: Gambatte, while you're in the company website, can you move the commonly used forms out of the log in area to the public zone? Too many people are complaining that they can't remember their log in when they just need to grab the forms.

Ooookay... I add a link on the page in the public area with some brief explanatory text, save it, fire a quick email off to the CEO to tell him it's done.

I've barely got back to browsing Reddit when a response comes back:

&gt; CEO: That's good, but now the page name doesn't make sense; it's no longer just ""Application Forms"". Change it to just ""Forms"".

&gt; Also, can you see if you can change the default font for heading and sub-headings from Times New Roman to Arial, and white instead of that horrible brown? I asked the developer about this, but he said it was really hard and would cost extra.

So I dive back into the website. A quick change in the CSS will be good enough for now, I'll go back and remove the manual heading style changes from the source later. Took about thirty seconds. I suppose if the website developer thinks they can squeeze more money out of the client, they will...

The difficult part is that for some reason, rather than building a header/menu template and using that (and thus allowing a change to every page with a single change to the template code), every single page has it's own header defined in it's source code.

[*ohhellno.avi*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o19CaOSuD8)

So I'm faced with going through every single page that has this page in it's menu, searching the source to remove the word ""Application"" from the menu item, or rebuilding every page on the website to apply a header that I'd have to create essentially from scratch anyway... and it's 4:30 on a Friday.

I'm going to have to go with my good friend [Murtaugh](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/013/292/tumblr_lz376laNSq1qaygy7o1_500.jpg) on this one, I'm afraid.

UPDATE EDIT: Most of this is summarizing information I later added in the comments. The developer was using a customized version of GetSimple CMS - the customization being to remove the useful tabs for things like themes/templates, backups or other plugins.

I was able to use a jQuery.load() to grab a header template into the nav div. There was some monkeying around with the MobileMenu plugin to make it work; mainly because I couldn't find where it was being called. I eventually got it to work in the callback function.

The customization of GetSimple consisted of commenting out a big chunk of one of the files in the admin folder that declared the access tabs to the additional features. So the features weren't removed, just the access to them... Uncommented the section, log out, log back in, hey presto!

This fix is pretty cheap if that is the case, but there's the chance it's the hard drive that's bad. We'd need to check it in for testing, if that's okay. We'll contact you as soon as we know what the repair options are.

&gt;M: I'm sorry, Ms. McLastnamehere, let me check the paperwork right now...well it looks like your system finished testing for tier one (I finished it that morning), and it's currently finishing testing in the back. [Begins to radio the back for information on the testing - we don't always have life updates on the system until testing is finished]

&gt;TF: WHY DON'T YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS IS YOUR JOB

&gt;M: [after getting a response from the back] Well, it looks like your flex cable is in need of replacement - your hard drive came up fine and testing with other hard drives showed the cable was faulty. We'll need to order one. That'll be here tomorrow if we get your okay, and it's $35 for the part and $20 for installa-

&gt;TF: YOU MEAN I HAVE TO PAY?

&gt;M: Well, yes ma'am, given that you're out of warranty. 

&gt;TF: WHAT THE F***, THE A****** YESTERDAY DIDN'T SAY I HAD TO PAY.

&gt;M: Actually, right here on the paperwork you signed off on it being an out of warranty repair and agreeing to it being a charge. It also says so in our Work Agreement, which is right above your signature in bold.

&gt;TF: WHAT THE HELL, THIS IS BULL****. THAT GUY YESTERDAY WAS LITERALLY THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD. HE NEVER EVEN TOLD ME I GET CHARGED FOR THIS, I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT IF HE TOLD ME I GOT CHARGED FOR THIS [well, actually, it's on the paperwork TWICE that she was going to be charged for this repair a minimum of $20 for the diagnostic, which is waved if we do any repairs. I read it out to her out loud before having her sign]. I WANT HIM FIRED. HE WAS LITERALLY THE WORST HELPER I'VE EVER MET.

&gt;M: Are we...are we talking about the same person? I was here when you were checked in, and he went through all of the procedure with you. He even pushed you up the queue given you had stated it was an emergency and seemed distressed.

&gt;TF: THAT'S IT, I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOUR SUPERVISOR.

At this point, my super comes out - a bigger guy who hasn't really worked a supervisor's position before this and is EXTREMELY new. Also kind of a huge accidental/sarcastically accidental prick a lot of the time. Poor guy wasn't ready.

&gt;TF: YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE TERRIBLE, THEY'RE TRYING TO CHARGE ME FOR A REPAIR THAT SHOULD BE FREE.

&gt;B: Ma'am, they're just doing your job. And I have it right here on my paperwork that you agreed to paying for the system repairs or diagnostic.

&gt;TF: WELL F*** YOU F****T [this didn't blow over well, given my supervisor is actually gay] I DIDN'T AGREE TO S***. I WANT MY COMPUTER BACK.

Sadly, having missed this, this apparently became a giant screaming match -- one sided, really. B kept trying to explain to her that literally no one would do this cheaper, and taking it to the Apple store will net the same result and require driving. He gave up after a few minutes, though.

&gt;B: Well, if you want your system back right now I can pack it up immediately, but it'll still be the $20 for diagnostics before we can release to you. [This caused more of the exact same argument, and then she began yelling about me needing to be fired again, and that he should be fired as well, and that M should be fired. Basically, this girl wanted our whole department gone.]

&gt;TF: [finally giving up] FINE. I'll just take it to Apple then! They'll do a better job. 

After a bit more cussing at us, she finally pays the $20 and goes to Apple. B, having worked at the Apple store, notes that the girl just wasted well over $100 extra - the fix from us would have taken just one day longer (would have been done day after all this) and she would have only needed to pay $35 more for all her issues to be solved.

People are so...odd sometimes.

Sorry for the wall of text!

TL;DR: Some girl doesn't listen to what she's signing to, requests for a whole department to be fired, and then goes on to end up spending hundreds more than needed.

bagofwisdom,6,8,1q4xra,27,"So we had a user this morning put in a ticket to the helpdesk complaining that he couldn't start his Windows Virtual Machine on his Linux desktop at his cube.  This happens if there's a power glitch or if there's any unusual behavior between the old-ass version of CentOS we're running (5.6) and the brand new hardware and VMWare player.  Something crashes while the VM is up and running and the .lck files remain keeping the user from starting the VM back up.

Now deleting these .lck files is ridiculously simple and takes us at the helpdesk mere moments to remove them and send the user back to his merry work.  Unfortunately this time our user decided to try and remedy the problem himself and somehow managed to delete every file in his virtual machine folder EXCEPT the .vmx file.

The kicker of all this though was that the user initially told my contractor he had deleted the .vmx file.  It never is that easy to fix.

At least the user promised to never ever use rm ever again.  Though I'll wish for that in one hand and crap in the other to see which fills up first.

RamsesThePigeon,21,17,1q4w7k,83,"Everyone here has at least one aggravating, astounding, or amusing Tale from Tech Support. I've told a few of my own, on occasion... but there's one that I've left in reserve. It happened several years ago, back when I was a self-styled editor of photographs for aspiring models. For some reason, the ability to airbrush a blemish resulted in some folks thinking of me as an all-knowing and exceptionally adept technical guru... but as I would learn, there's always someone who's a little more skilled.

Now, I should mention that I'm not a typical IT guy... in fact, I'm an [author](http://www.nearlydeparted.net) who works at a video game company to pay the bills. At the time of this story, I was casually acquainted with a young woman who had, by a process of not-so-subtle suggestion and outright pleading, convinced her aunt - Ellen, we'll call her - to finally get her children (ages ten and twelve) their own personal computers. Why this was such a powerful obsession for my friend is still unknown to me, but I agreed with the sentiment. After all, these kids had been limited to using the ""family computer"" for the majority of their lives, a fact which made school projects and socialization alike into somewhat difficult tasks.

After having been finally convinced, Aunt Ellen bought each of her children a desktop computer. Then, to further cement her household's position in the Information Age, she switched from the bottom-rung DSL connection they'd been using, and upgraded to a respectably fast cable service. (The inclusion of television channels and a home phone line may have helped her with that decision.) However, she discovered with some dismay that setting up her network was a bit of a daunting challenge. That's where I came in.

At first, this seemed like it would be a simple task... just set up a router, install a few wireless NICs, and be done with it. However, Aunt Ellen had a few special requests: 

""The most important thing,"" she told me, ""is an Internet password.""

I nodded my understanding, though I wasn't completely sure what she wanted. ""Do you mean a WiFi password?"" I asked. ""Something to protect your wireless network?""

""Oh, yes, certainly that,"" replied Aunt Ellen, ""but I also want to keep my kids off the Internet if it's past dinnertime. That's when all the creeps come out."" 

Well, that was fine, and although I had some private thoughts on the matter, I wasn't there to offer parenting advice or play Internet Educator. I set up the network, put the necessary conditions in place on the router, and moved on.

""Okay, great!"" Aunt Ellen said, visibly pleased. ""Next, put passwords on each of the new computers."" She didn't immediately offer an explanation for this, but my assumption was that it was to keep her son (the ten-year-old) from snooping on his sister's machine (and vice versa). 

""Do you want to have your kids set up their own passwords?"" I asked.

Aunt Ellen's answer was given with a look of shock. ""Oh, no, no! No, only my husband and I will know them. I don't want my kids on the computer without permission!"" Again, that seemed counterproductive to me, but I held my tongue and did her bidding. With that complete, my final task was to reconnect the ""family computer"" to the network, and go on my merry way.

The following day, I received a phone call from my friend. Her Aunt Ellen, it seemed, was having some unspecified difficulties with the new network setup, and she wanted to know if I could stop by and help. I was wary of becoming this family's personal IT technician, but the fear that I'd done something wrong brought me back to their house. Upon arrival, Aunt Ellen explained to me that her husband had been unable to check his email the night before.

""I know you did your best,"" she said, ""but do you think maybe something went wrong?""

""Well, I can certainly find out,"" I replied. ""Do you know if he used the right password? Remember, if it's after seven, you need to enter it first.""

Aunt Ellen smiled and nodded. ""Oh, yes, definitely! I even tried it myself.""

I was skeptical, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and pulled up the router's configuration page. Everything seemed to be in order... except for an extra entry which I'd never seen before. It specifically locked a handful of URLs, each of them clearly pornographic in nature, and had the curious label of ""NoFacebook=NoPorn.""

""I need to check something,"" I told Aunt Ellen. ""Do you mind if I look at..."" I thought for a brief moment before continuing. ""... at your daughter's computer?""

We went up to the girl's room, and - after Aunt Ellen made me avert my gaze while she entered the necessary password - had a look at the computer in question. Lo and behold, *somebody* had created a second administrator account, and their browser history showed that it had been used the night before to access the router. Suddenly, it dawned on me: I'd never changed the router's default password, and Aunt Ellen's sweet, innocent, twelve-year-old daughter had taken it upon herself to passive-aggressively block her father's access to his pornography.

It was, to say the least, an awkward predicament.

Fortunately, I managed to resolve the situation while leaving everyone's pride intact, although it took a lot more finesse than I had expected the task to require. In the end, the father's browsing capabilities were restored, the router's password was changed, and nobody (save perhaps the twelve-year-old) was any wiser... and even though I undid her work, I left the bent paperclip that I saw seated beside the girl's keyboard.

arnathor,35,23,1q4qht,105,"Right, this is the text of a comment I just made, but I realised it is so long it is basically a post!

I used to work for an accountancy firm in Manchester here in the UK. We were dual site, the other office was in Liverpool (this s ssemi-relevant). I wasn't the tech guy, just an accounting junior/auditor, but I was probably the most tech-minded after our one tech guy.

We had just one tech guy, a great guy called Steve. Not the guy who built the network, but he was the guy who maintained it with hardly any downtime. He'd inheritted it from the previous tech guy who had cut some corners... Steve had a day off booked - I think it was his son's 2nd birthday or something. He lived in Liverpool. In the Manchester office, we're trying to log on to our systems but EVERYTHING is grinding to an absolute halt. We have no external connectivity, there seemed to be a ton of data being transferred but nobody could do anything, each laptop (we had individual laptops that we just plugged in on a daily basis - half the time we were out on site auditting anyway) was almost unusable, assuming that you were able to log in. Desktop stations used by the partners and managers were just dying on their feet. This was back in the XP days, around late 2006, early 2007.

Now, we were running the latest Windows Server, and we had server blades at both offices, looking at unified hard drives - both servers kept a copy of the hard drive and in the event one hard drive set up fails, the other site was supposed to seamlessly take over and resume (at least that's how it was explained to me).

Steve was called in from his day off - a good hour's drive from where he lived. He had tried to remote desktop in but at that time his broadband was flaky and couldn't logon. Since the problem was only affecting the Manchester office he decided to come on site. It's a credit to him that he survived a partner having a massive go at him for the ""network problems"" while turning up in his civvies and not even having had a chance to look at the network yet.

All the activity lights seemed to be locked on full, and the servers were running extra hot, fans sounding like they were running at full RPM.

Steve was unfazed apparently, although he did get worried when he was unable to actually log in and see what the issue was on the terminal in the server cupboard (it didn't really seem big enough to call a room).

So he ran around the office telling everyone (who were all pretty much unable to do their work anyway as they had no access to current working copied of the accounting job databases) to shut down their machines.

Everything was shutdown and there was still massive activity. He ended up restarting the server. When is came back up, massive activity again. By now, Steve is panicking.

And then... one of the tax girls had been at an appointment in the morning and came in late, didn't seem to realise that everybody was simultaneously flapping around and also doing nothing, sat down at her desk, took out her laptop and then wondered out loud why she couldn't find the end of the ethernet cable to plug into it.

Problem solved - the cable had obviously fallen back through the hole the previous night and a well-meaning cleaner, not realising what it was and obviously thinking that they had knocked it out, had plugged it back in to the spare socket on the dual ethernet plate in the wall.

Steve ceremonially unplugged the offending cable and ta-da! The network was almost instantly back to normal.

To be fair, we should have recreated the moment the following April Fool's Day...

In my time as a lowly T1 tech at a small university, I've encountered the typical problems such as the monitor != computer and the plethora of password resets, but last week I encountered one of those problems to which I can only respond with confusion.

The user walked in to Helpdesk and described some issues connecting to wireless networks.  She absolutely could not connect to the campus wireless, but she could connect to her phone's hotspot. Even then she could only connect, not actually browse the internet.  My initial response, and that suggested by my supervisor, was to try installing new wireless drivers (the computer could still connect via a wired connection).

The drivers downloaded as a zip file, and this particular user had WinZip set as default.  However, WinZip failed to open the archive, and instead presented me with this curious error:

[Time Travel?](http://imgur.com/Z72KKAa)

I had to reproduce this error in a VM to get the picture, as users tend to react poorly when you laugh at their problems and ask to take pictures for retelling purposes.  To add to the confusion, her computer had somehow been set to the year 7913.

Everything that had not been working with the computer ceased its disagreement once the time was changed to reflect the present day, and the user swore she had no idea how the date got to be nearly 6000 years in the future, but the system date is now on my list of things to check when the wireless is not cooperating.

Blind Transfers--

“When the person receiving a call transfers the caller to another person without telling that person anything about the caller or why they are calling.”
 

This is usually very frustrating for the customer as they have to introduce themselves and explain why they are calling again.


“That company sucks - I had a problem with their product and when I called to get it resolved, I was blind transferred. The person at the other end answered, “Hey.” And then I had to explain the problem all over again after an apology.”
 

This is also frustrating to the recipient of the transfer as they see your Caller ID on the phone and answer it accordingly--they are not prepared to take the call.

mcac,14,31,1q47br,192,"I work in software support and my boyfriend is a programmer, but today's story is from the other side.

My boyfriend and I recently moved into a new house. Because both of our jobs require us to have internet access at home, I had to make sure that the transfer of our internet service was as seamless as possible. We had the service turned on at our new place the Friday before we moved, and were scheduled to have the service at our old place turned off on the following Wednesday.

On Friday, we met a tech at our new house to get the service turned on. We took our current modem with us so that we could verify everything was working. Unfortunately once we got back to the old apartment and plugged everything back in, we found that our service there had been turned off. I called up our ISP, and the tech confirmed that the tech did indeed have our service shut off. Tech apologized and said he would give us a call back once they re-activated our service.

Got a call back a few minutes later to let us know that our service had been turned on. My laptop (wireless) was connected. Yay! I checked my desktop, and it looked like it was connected to the router, but no internet access. Boo! We have a modem/router combo, and it was odd that the wireless network was fine, but LAN was not.

Spent about 30-45 minutes on the phone with the tech trying different troubleshooting steps. I could tell he was getting flustered, and he sounded like he was ready for me to blow up on him at any moment. I let him know that I also work in tech support so I understand how frustrating it is when things just don't work the way they are supposed to.

Eventually he asked me to hard-reset my modem/router. When I got over there, I noticed something off...

**Me:** Oh, I found the problem...

**Tech:** What is it?

**Me:** My boyfriend plugged in two ends of one ethernet cable into the router...

**Tech:** *laughing* I actually haven't run into that one before!

After removing the rogue cable everything worked perfectly. The tech thanked me for giving him a new troubleshooting step to add to his repertoire, and we hung up.

sadak5,12,23,1q3xq6,63,"Inspired by /u/xoticrox tale ""Well your just not helping me at all!!"", I like to share to all of you 

In Mexico capital city/state there is a misconception that ""free internet"" is stealing. Even, that using any intelectual property without permision is stealing.

Here is semi-legal to sell any DB with personal data (depending of the data, it can be ""legal"" to anounce), even the ones to connect to WIFI (those ones that you can find for free in the interwebs) that have every default SSID and default password of every modem sold by the big local (and monopolic) company. This agravated by the fact that every modem comes with the WIFI enabled, no firewall enabled, and every admin password is the same. Even they alter (corrupt) the modem firmware to brand it, and to make it ""user friendly"".

You can go to downtown, and in almost every corner in the street you can buy your free package containing a wireless USB receiver, a ""program"" that ""cracks"" the password (just an IDE of an app that reads the SSID and query a database). So, basically, just plug the USB and with one click you steal the internet.

Well, to the tales.

Two years ago, I bought my apartment there (for other reasons, I rent it now and I'm living in Guadalajara now). Before moving, I contracted everything I will need in my new independent life, you know, internet, with phone service because said company doesn't sell internet service only, and cable tv.

Well, when I finished moving, I procced to connect the modem provided by [company], and then I arranged my couchs, tv, and somethings to make my first own meal. This took around 2 hours.

Then, I procced to conect my laptop using an ethernet cable (I didn't want to lose control while configuring it). I configured the modem in my parents house since they contracted service, when we first received our 256 kbps modem, then when we received our first wireless modem. Everytime I changed both the admin password and the wireless password, or disbled the admin one and created one for me. 

Well, that was my principal objective with this brand new modem. But when I tried to connect and test my internet speed, never got the one I contracted. I payed for 5 Mbps, but I was getting less than 1 Mbps. This company is know for their bad support service, mainly because they are tech ignorant and only follow anything that is in their manuals, and when there is something that is not there, they frezee (I will tell a history of this in another time).

I procced to check the modem properties to see if this one is faulted (happened once when living with my parents). But while I was checking the options (a 2Wire modem), I clicked in the LAN configuration and saw the connected adresses list. WTF! There was at least 5 devices already connected! I owned at that moment a Wii, Ipad, Ipod and my laptop, and those weren't configured yet!

Add the mac address to the black list. Power recicle the modem. WTF! They still connect!
Tested adding the mac address of my ipad to the black list and connect it. It can connect. First diagnosis, the black list is fucked up by [company] customization (I say corruption!) of the firmware.

Test white list enabled and add laptop and ipad addresses. Still can connect.
Change wifi password, change SSID name, change SSID to hidden. 

Then I heard a frantict ""the internet is not working!"" scream from upper apartment, and a ""can't connect to my email"" in the one next door.

A grin appeared in my face, and reversed the changes for a moment and hear they can navigate again. Then do the changes again. After telling this to my work friend (the grumpy one I mentioned in other tales), he gifted me a wireless modem that He had in his office (because he bought it with his money to try to do an extension for the wireless network and never worked, this was his modem).

I changed the modem, tested the black / white list features, and sticked with this one.

So, you know now I like to trully have control of something we own, to avoid an unauthorized could use it without consent. The ironic part was that my sister reseted the modem in my parents house a couple of weeks ago, because she didn't knew the password (I was the only one that had wireless devices in my parents house, and their PC is connected using ethernet cable). After doing that, she protested because the download speed was too slow.

I secured the network again and gave her the password. A week later, the modem was reset again.

Warlizard,467,436,1q3wpz,1198,"I've been waiting to get some more info before I updated so here it is, with clarification on exactly what happened:

Here's the original post - http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ps0ae/tldr_accounting_firm_gets_cryptolocker_virus_tech/

It turns out that what they wiped was ALL of the local backups -- they still have the files that were encrypted by the virus.

I have spoken with the owner god knows how many times and it has been frustrating.

From the get-go, the owner's actions have baffled me. I told her that if she just sent me the encrypted key, I'd see if I could crack it, but she's apparently so tech-un-savvy that she simply doesn't know how to do anything at all with it. 

Her tech has been with her for more than a decade and is a family friend, however, he bolted and she can't reach him.

Naturally, she's pissed off as hell at him because, well, he deleted all the Carbonite backups, deleted Carbonite, forgot the password and can't install it back.

From one of the comments in the last post, I learned that the hackers who created the virus are now allowing people to log into an onion site through Tor, send an encrypted file, pay about 2k in bitcoins, then they promise they'll send the unencryption key plus a utility to unlock everything.

The owner is naturally skeptical that she'll get the key after paying 2k, plus the world of the deep web may as well be wizardry, plus since her tech guy is AWOL, she really has no one to help her out.

I told her that I'd log into her server, grab the carbonite-encryption.pem key and see if I could get the password from it, but I guess she got too busy last night to do it.

This morning she sent me a text asking if we could do it today, however, it's my birthday.

I don't work on my birthday. At all. Period. Today is the day I fuck off and do precisely what I want, without thinking about anything other than doing fun things.

To that end, I'm going to eat food that's bad for me, drink concoctions that will inebriate me, spend time with people of ill-repute, and do nothing at all of any value.

Tomorrow, when I get the file, I'm going to throw the 64-bit cuda version of hashcat at it and see what happens.

I've already pulled  down a 2GB collection of dictionaries, but let's be real -- the odds are low.

This whole thing has been really bizarre. The owner should have thrown the $300 at the original people and gotten her shit back, the tech should have WRITTEN DOWN THE FUCKING PASSWORD, they never should have wiped the backups, deleted Carbonite, only had one backup, etc., but hey, this is the perfect storm of shitty and it is what it is.

I've learned a ton of interesting stuff so for that reason alone, it has been worth it.

Anyway, I'm off to get the mirror on my car fixed (fuck Mercedes and their $400 bill) that I foolishly cracked when I tapped the gates leaving my community, get a hair cut, and I'll continue to snapchat the fuck out of the day.

Oh, and I've gotten the best snaps from you guys and it's really fun, so if you're bored, add me (Warlizard) and you TOO can see absolutely nothing of interest from the great state of Arizona :)

Laterz.

EDIT: First of all, wasn't trying to be a pretentious fucktard about the mirror, was just angry with myself for being a dumbass and hitting the gate because I was trying to beat it closing.

Next, just had my car washed and the guys there are replacing the mirror, fixing the cracked turn signal on the front of it, fixing the crack in the bumper, repainting the bumper, detailing the car and wet-sanding / waxing the whole car for a bit more than the dealership wanted to just replace the mirror glass. So fuck the dealership.

The owner told the tech that he should cover half of the cost to get this shit fixed and that's when he bolted. If I were in her shoes, I'd pay the 2k and hope I didn't get fucked. It seems to me that the only way this scam works is if the hackers actually do what they say they're going to do.

Cyfun06,178,327,1q3a4b,1151,"Used to work at a cable ISP callcenter.  Many of you probably know that cable modems have... or used to have... a Standby button on the top, and if you hit it, it would essentially turn off your internet.  God forbid they call the button something logical like Off or Internet Disabled.  Us TSAs loved these calls though cause it was the easiest fix in the world.

I should also mention that we had an automated voice recording where if a person lived in or near a city with a known outage, it'd just tell them while they're on hold so they didn't have to wait to talk to a real person.  Unfortunately, it was activated per city, so it was often overkill if the outage was small.

One day, a dude gets through to me cause his internet has been down for days and he asks when the outage will be fixed.  I tell him there's some work being done across town, but no outages affecting him directly.  Have him look at his modem, and sure enough, it's in Standby.  He presses the button and his internet returns.

I ask him the required ""Is there anything else I can help you with today?"" He says he wants his account credited for his lack of internet the past few days.  He's not yelling at me or being pissy or anything, just says it matter of fact-ly.  I explain to him that there was no outage, his internet wasn't down, he'd somehow bumped that button and shut off the internet from his end. The problem was entirely on his end.

He argued that he had no way of knowing what that button meant, that nobody explained it when it was installed and he never received a modem manual.  I pointed out that had he called sooner, we could have fixed it immediately. He said that he actually called several times over the past few days, and the automated recording said there was an outage affecting his area, so he hung up.

I tried a bit more to argue against it, but in all fairness, he was right, we did make things pretty confusing. Plus, he wasn't bitching me out, which I did appreciate.  And we had the authority to credit people up to $50 without requiring approval.  So I crunched the numbers real quick, and told him at $50 a month and being down for 3 days was only $5.

bjs1400,5,8,1q2m4e,29,"First time posting, yadda yadda, deal with it.

I'm a software developer and used to work for a small ""Top 15"" CRM software company.  At the time I handled customer customizations to the base product where the client may want pretty much anything added to the standard offering.  The product was a Windows Forms .NET application with a SQL Server backend.

The entire software product suffered from many windows being cluttered with tons of textboxes fighting for screen real estate (read: ugly).  I was working on one particular project where the client wanted an additional field added to an already uglified window.  They didn't want any of the existing fields removed from the screen, just theirs added.  No big deal.  It'll still be ugly, but it's what they're asking for.

What they were requesting was to store something up to like ~100 characters of plain text.  So, I go create the backing SQL table/column in the database, do what I need to do in code to use that column, add the textbox to the window, tie the textbox to the SQL-column, and done.  This is something I've done hundreds of times before for other clients, so no real challenge.  The textbox only had about a 1.5-inch width on screen, but I was fighting for screen real estate, so obviously the entire 100 characters wouldn't be visible all at once; again, no big deal.  I package up the change, ship it off to the customer with instructions on how to apply the change.  My work here is done, or so I thought.

Later on, one of the tech support guys comes to my cube (I got along real well with all the tech support guys) and asks if I worked on this particular change.  I say yes, and wonder what the problem is.  He informs me that the customer is saying he can only type like 10 characters in the textbox and is PISSED.

Admittedly, the QA-process of this company was pretty much non-existent, so it was entirely possible something was messed up as I was the only person to even look at this, much less test it (and everyone knows developers are terrible testers).  I take a look at the code and don’t see anything wrong.  I double checked the column width in the database, the max-length property of the textbox on the screen, do my own testing, etc. and don't see any issues.  I re-package the changed up again anyway, send it to the customer again with more instructions on how to apply the changes.  Didn’t think much of it, maybe just a glitch in the matrix, PEBKAC, whatever.

The customer ends up calling tech support again, claiming to have the same issue, even more upset.  Tech Support Dude (TSD) ends up double checking with me quickly making sure I sent the customer the new update-package, and I say I have.  Ok, so he starts up a webex session (screen sharing service, not sure what’s popular now, or if it’s still in use) so he can see exactly what the customer is experiencing.  I’m curious what the issue is, so I’m a silent-observer of the call watching the monitor over TSD’s shoulder.  The customer loads up our application, navigates to the window I modified and goes to the newly added textbox and holds down the f-key and says “SEE! It’s not allowing me to enter any more than 10 characters!  You guys are so terrible and I’m tired of wasting my time with what should be a simple change, blah blah blah…”

Me and the tech-support guy look at each other both realizing exactly what the issue is.  

TSD: “Sir, can you please try entering some other characters in the textbox?”

Customer: “OK….    Oh….”  (whatever he typed after all those f’s appeared just as it should have)

TSD: “What you were typing was being entered and recorded properly the entire time.  You just weren’t able to see it being entered because the textbox only shows about 10 characters at a time.  In your test you were just using a single character and thus when the textbox scrolled as you typed, it wasn’t noticeable…”

At this point the client realizes how much of a moron he has been, interrupts the explanation, thanks us quickly, and ends the call.

TL;DR: Customer didn’t realize that the text in a textbox can scroll and thus hold more than just the characters being displayed at the time.

echo_xtra,15,8,1q2gwc,45,"So, this takes a bit of setup, most of which is not IT related, but do bear with me, my part is.

Back in the day, the Sioux Tribe of South Dakota [sued the U.S. Interior Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobell_v._Salazar) for breach of trust.  Their essential claim was that that the Bureau of Indian Affairs had made deals for their land in their name, and then never paid the tribe any money.  Judge Royce Lamberth, a reasonalbe person for a federal judge, said, ""OK, this appears to be a paperwork thing, send it to my office.""

The BIA stuff sent to his office was sent in *biohazard containers*, as it was covered in mouse poop potentially infected with Hanta virus.  This, I think, did somewhat prejudice the judge against the government's case.

So, when the tribe said, ""Look, any reasonably skilled person can not only read the data from their online database, but actually change the numbers in it,"" he did something quite unreasonable, but... what do judges do if not that.

He said: ""Take the relevant bureaus offline until you can convince me that has not and cannot happen.""  ""Well, we don't know actually what's relevant.""  ""Then, the whole Department of Interior is coming OFFLINE until you figure it out!  Don't come whining to me until you've done this!""

Now, here's the part of the story where I come in.  I worked for the DOI in the Bureau of Land Management.  We mostly make sure people don't fuck up the desert.  We lived in a building shared by the Dept of Agriculture, Bureau of Fish and Wildlife, which did the same thing for the nearby mountains.

We lived in the same building, doing very similar projects, and, as I notably in IT for this story, SHARING THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE.

When the court's order came down, my boss and me had a problem: we, by legal decree, has to create a parallel infrastructure that didn't touch the other one.  No bridges, no firewalls, no talking to each other, no passing notes, no ZIP!  We were OFF THE GRID, PERIOD.

Well, it wasn't a lot of work to patch our employees and servers onto a separate network, but then, the Forest Circus people could not only not email anyone they could feasibly phone... they couldn't access our data servers any more, and we had the bulk of the land data.

""Can't you just hook me back up?""  ""Not without a substantial untraceable bribe.""

Well, this was obviously a huge impact to everyone's work, so were looking for ways around it.  The publicly published data was pretty easy for the Forest Service guys, they were still ON the internet.  But on my side of the pond, things were looking pretty bleak.  Our field techs were still adding data, but only we could access it, and interpolation was difficult.

So my boss and went old-skool, and reinvented sneakernet.  I mean, you can't really hack a burned CD for data that isn't actually ON there.  So were burned all the relevant data onto two sets of CDs, put them on TWO CD towers, and put one on each network, updated daily with basically what you'd call an incremental backup scheme.

This did pass management muster, because there wasn't any wired connection, so we did this for some while.  I'm kinda proud that my older roots in this business pointed a way to a solution.

That's my story, and I'm mostly sticking to it.

I later figured out that the way I was picking up the laptop pressed down on a faulty connection between the video card that realigned it for as long as I held it.

datagangster,4,3,1q1n2l,25,"I used to work the help desk(and repair desk) for a university that gave out laptops to the students as part of their included tuition. Primarily most students pick up their laptop in the fall at the beginning of the semester. However, most of the sports teams come in a few weeks earlier since they arrive at campus early. One day, about half of the volleyball team came in. (Note: only 1 girl was picking up her laptop, the other 7 were for moral support apparently) I noticed they were having a really difficult time with the computer. I asked if they were having trouble and they said they couldn't figure out how to turn it on. I showed them the power button and all was well. As I returned to my desk I noted the issuance time and the ticket resolution time; it took them over 6 minutes of guessing before asking for my help....",Turning on a computer takes teamwork....,28
plague_cold,35,28,1q1jim,168,"Here's a story from a while back but still confuses me to this day.

It's a bit of a long one but i hope you enjoy it as much as i did.

I work in a small computer shop in Michigan in a town full of rich people who think you're their slaves for some reason.

So this lady comes in saying that her computer wont turn on, so i plug it in on the front desk and attempt to power it up... no love.

I take a PSU tester to it, lo and behold its dead. So i tell her the PSU is dead and we would have to replace it, she says ""Yeah that's fine go for it."" the whole time I'm replacing it she's hitting on me big time, saying things like ""Are you on any dating sites?? I'm on a few of them so if you look me up I'm sure you'll find me. *Wink wink*"" 

Me: ""Yeah that's great, ha ha"" 

Trying to play it off.

I finally get it replaced, charge her and send it out the door.

Keep in mind that i never once let the computer boot into windows, I only let it post before i shut it down and told her it was working.

 (To be honest i just wanted to get her out of the store as she was creeping me out big time.)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Fastforward a few days i get a call something like this:

Me: ""Thank you for calling XX this is plauge_cold how can i help you?""

Her: ""YEAH, i brought my computer in the other day to have it fixed and now its full of viruses!!!""

Me: ""Could you tell me what we did to it??""

Her: ""You replaced the power thingy and now its all f****ed up!!""

It was apparent from the last time she was in that she was out of her damn mind.

Her: ""I wan't you to come out here and fix it right away!!""

Me: Thinking that i had a few stops to make anyway was like ""Sure i'll be right out, where do you live?""

Her: ""I live on XX lane""

Me: ""Alright i'll be over in like twenty minutes okay?""

Her: ""FINE"" *Hangs up*

I now realize that what i did was a mistake.

------------------------------
I went over to her house and she was so happy to see me, saying things like:

Her: ""Oh its good to see you, it gets so lonely here by myself, the computers right over here.""

She is like wayyy to old for me.

So i sit down at the desk and check out the desktop... its all links to things like ""FIND HOT MEN IN YOUR AREA!"",
I'm thinking ""Ohh boy, what have i gotten myself into.""

And then her mood changes in the blink of an eye and she starts bitching at me like crazy:

Her: ""WTF did you do to this thing!?!? It was never like this!! My mom says it was your fault!!""

I cant remember all that she said because i was in this state of shock. Out of nowhere comes this haggard old woman
(that i'm assuming was her mom, though how she was still alive is a mystery) that starts bitching me out too.

So i calmly get up, put my shoes on, don't say a word, walk out the door, get in the car and leave. I look in the mirror as i'm leaving and the're standing on the porch with the most confused look ever, like:

""Was it something i said??"" 

Once i get back to the store a call comes in from the POLICE???

I pick it up and say: 

Me: ""Thank you for calling, how may i help you?""

Officer: ""I just got a call from a woman saying you broke a piece of her computer equipment and charged her for it?? To be honest i don't know what she wants me to do about it but she gave me this number.""

Me: ""Well Officer, I really don't know what to do either, she bought her computer in and we replaced a hardware component and she is complaining about software problems that she didn't pay us to fix therefore we didn't touch them.""

Officer: ""Hmm... wait is this plauge_cold?""

Me: ""Yes sir?""

As it turns out the officer on the phone was one of our long time customers and he proceeded to ask if his computer was finished.

In the end we both basically agreed she was crazy and there was nothing we could do about it, he came in to pick up his machine and told us that she had called many more times and that he told her that there was nothing he could do about it.

It took all my strength to not high five that police officer right then and there.

She was trying to complete a big spreadsheet project, and random text was appearing in cells.  As I she was talking to me, I remoted into her pc and watched the cells fill with what seemed like random gibberish.

I went to her desk, and saw that it was only filling in when she was talking, and it seemed to fill in gibberish that was similar in syntax and structure to what she was saying.  She helpfully suggested that it could be a virus trying to spy on her work, put there by the Chinese or the competition.

I looked in her system preferences, and the laptop's built in mic was enabled, and lo and behold, her excel was recording what she had been ""dictating.""

myPCRunsOnKerosene,34,14,1q1h0i,57,"First post, hope this isn't too long.

I've been with this company for 9 months, and I tend to live by the ""3 strike"" rule when it comes to being bent over a desk. In the military, we referred to this as ""the green weenie"". 


I work for a small company of about 13 users in what I thought was supposed to be general IT. I got the position shortly before I got my Associate's, and it is my 3rd IT gig. The original posting called for a ""jack of all trades"" IT person with skills in Networking, Servers, PC Support, and Customer Support. What I realized almost immediately after being hired was that they were hunting for IT talent for supporting their Software. What the job should have been posted as was ""Software Support"".


**Strike1**. I've been duped into working positions other than the listed before, so I was rather upset. However, I still did get to play with the in-house network and server systems from time to time, so I bit my tongue and forged on. Once the guy that I was replacing left, I made it a point to attempt to lead the company to victory via IT. For example, their server room was in a cramped closet that was prone to overheating. I ripped out all of the cabinets for better airflow, and rotated the servers to blow all of the hot air towards the door. This allowed the cool air from the AC Unit to flow between the servers for more efficient cooling.


**One out of the 8 servers was being backed up**. Even worse, it was just being backed up to **itself**. I immediately made a backup of everything and stored them on our NAS. Better than nothing, and since I was technically supposed to be focusing on ""Software Support"", the actual backup plan and DR plan fell to the wayside. To keep this story as short as possible, if you can think of every obvious best practice for IT, this place isn't following it. Throw it out there, and I guarantee you are correct. We have about 20 different sites utilizing our Software, so this makes it even worse.


The CEO is looking to gain more customers by becoming a re-seller for a well-known document management product. He hires a person that is certified in this product to lead the charge, and also decides that I don't have enough to do, so tells me (""asks"" me, but you all know what that really means) that I will be working with it as well. No big deal, I guess. I get a moderate pay raise after asking for it (it wasn't offered initially), and they send me to the training. Turns out it isn't really training, so much as a week-long refresher course that ends with the certification exam. I'm not ready for this, and I fail (barely, but still). 


Cue a meeting with my manager and the new product person. Manager has printed out my IT tickets and has them in front of her. I know this can only be bad news. Summarized, the meeting is basically about me needing to put the ""IT Stuff"" to the side so I can divide my time 50/50 with our product and the new product. imnotokwiththis.gif **Strike 2.**


I take two days off and send my manager an email stating my woes. I basically tell her I felt duped into the position I'm in, I didn't go to school for IT to be a Software Support lackey, and I am very unhappy. She talks to me when I come back in and says ""Oh no, I didn't mean you would be doing [new product] and Support, I meant you would be doing [new product] and IT! Sorry you took it that way."" Now, I'm not stupid, I know what she just did. But I felt she actually listened to me, so I let it slide. New product person goes on vacation for a week, and I only get one call for [new product]. **I effectively utilize my time to develop (not yet implement) a DR Plan so I can bring it to the CEO, fix a degraded RAID Array that killed a SQL Server, rebuild said SQL Server, and create a guest network in light of recent CryptoLocker scares.**


It's a good week, I'm happy to be at work doing what I thought I was really being hired to do. New product person comes back from vacation. Cue meeting with manager and [new product] person. My manager, **yet again** has my tickets printed out in front of her. We have the SAME EXACT CONVERSATION as a few weeks ago (this time with more statistics about productivity and implementation requirements for [new product]), and I am again asked to drop the ""IT Stuff"". I am asked ""Is any of this IT Stuff priority?"" The tickets include:


Implement backup plan, implement GPO to keep viruses (particularly Crypto) from auto-running (**EVERYONE has domain administrative rights, minus (1) who has local admin only**), configure a WSUS Server (at the request of the CEO!) so everything is up to date on security, hide our Company Wi-Fi SSIDs, transfer the entire company's data from the internal hard drive (hooked externally) to our File Server to a more secure location (yeah), among other things.


Needless to say, I'm looking for other positions that are actually IT. I can't be held responsible when everything fails and everything is lost, when I've been told to work on other things. Thanks for reading my rant.","""So, is any of this IT stuff really important?"" LONG POST",71
slickyyy,5,6,1q1eti,30,"After the proper greeting, he started off like this...

Him: Yeah man, the FBI is tracking my stuff yo! How do I get them to stop tracking me?

(We have no protocol to answer these kind of questions, other than to contact authorities if they believe someone is tapped into their phone)

Me: The information I'm able to obtain does not tell me if someone is ""tracking"" your phone. You'll need to contact the authorities to file a proper report. 

Him: Nah man you don't understand, these dudes keep doing this to me, got me 3 months a year ago

He called back the next day claiming that we were the ones tracking his phone, and reporting his activity to the police.

This is clearly a new case so our developers actually custom-built an extended logger to capture what error was being returned by the component that calls Exchange. I get on the machine and get this set up, and try to run it again.

Two days later, the ticket comes back. ""I installed powerhsell like you said, and it's still broken."" So I go in and copy over the logging. Lo and behold, the same error message. So at this point I go into the Registry, and it's about as obvious that it can be that he has done nothing of the sort.


So I spend five minutes writing up a .reg file that will create all the keys and values necessary, and shoot him off a quick email. ""I've created this file, I just need your approval to run it since this is your clients production machine.""


""Go ahead,"" he sends back, ""But I've already followed that article.""


*No, you very clearly didn't, since those registry keys are still screwed up.* So I run the .reg file, and it executes and creates all the values it's supposed to. *If you had, it would be fixed right now.*

But whatever, I guess hackers could be assholes just to be assholes.

""Sure"" I said, ""bring it over to the side desk and I'll take a look at it.""

She places it down, I boot it up and sure enough it's a typical Windows 7 boot screen. Nothing suspicious so far.

""Alright, could you try to log in now?"" I asked, hoping that the problem would go away with my mere presence.

""OK but it's not going to work."" She tried her password and the login box shook, denying entry. I'm thinking to myself it has to be a typing error. I ask her to try again a few more times but no luck. At this point I ask her for the password and I try to log in but with no luck. She had to have remembered her password wrong, there's no way we could both be consistently fucking this up.

She thinks about it. ""It's 8 letters.""

I set the password cracking tool down, and try her password again. Typing slowly until I reach the end...only 7 hidden password characters show up in the login text box. No freaking way.

Cyfun06,31,34,1q0l7o,146,"Was a night-shift tech support lackey at a big hospital of about 1500 computers.  My shift was 7pm to 7am and I was the only one in the whole department for that stretch.

We'd just gone through a huge transition to this god-awful Java-based system for Obama's big paperless push that somehow managed to use twice as much paper hospital-wide.  Lots of barcode printing on labels and so forth. Pretty much every damn clinical department was extremely dependent on printers.

Thanks to this new system, the Windows print server was throwing fits. Stuff would often jam up in queue for no apparent reason, and the only way to fix it would be to restart the print spooler, which of course dropped ALL printing for a few minutes.  The problem got worse and worse, until the Windows admins finally decided to replace the stand-alone print server with one in a virtual environment.

So they were of course going to roll it out in the evening to minimize disruption.  One of the Windows admins stays late to do it, he eventually sticks his head into my office that he is pushing it through in 1 min and to tell anyone who calls about printer issues to give it 5 minutes.  I get a few calls but nothing really major.  Apparently he just cloned the IP of the old server to minimize any confusion over mapping.  All seems to be well, so he goes home.

About an hour later, I start getting more calls of stuff not print at all.  I test print to the printers fine, but half the stuff people are printing isn't coming out.  I look at the printer queues, and random stuff isn't even hitting the queues.  More and more calls start flooding in.  I'm the only one there so I'm swamped pretty quickly.  I call my boss (different from aforementioned admin) and let him know that printing is FUBAR.

It's like 10pm, but he drives out to see wtf is going on.  He reboots the new virtual print server several times, looks over everything and it all seems fine.  We visit various departments to do test prints but are still unable to figure out why some stuff prints fine and other stuff never hits the queue.  He was originally a network admin, so he even fires up his packet tracing software to monitor the traffic, but is still baffled.

I'm tagging along with the poor guy, all my other work is taking backseat til we get this figured out.  He's been up for like 15 hours and is exhausted and frustrated.  Hours go by. Probably around 4am, I ask him, ""Are you sure the old server is turned off?"" He barks back, ""Of course it is!""

He's made a few calls to the admin who did the switchover, but finally tells the guy to get his ass in and fire the old server back up before day shift gets in.  So the admin drags his ass in and gets to work firing up the old server.  A few minutes later, he comes back out and says to try it now.  We start having departments test their printing and all seems to be working!

We ask him wtf he did so quickly.  He tells us that apparently the old server never shut down completely.  Since it had the same IP as the new server, the network would randomly route traffic to the still-active connection of the old server.  Any traffic routing to the new server would print fine. He merely hard powered off the old server.

My boss and I looked at each other.  It took all my strength not to yell ""I SO FUCKING CALLED IT!""",Did I leave the oven on?,180

I didn't answer because I was ..ahem...busy. :)


Does she leave a message? No. She calls again.


And again. And again. And again. 
Nothing is more aggravating than the repeated sound of a cell phone disrupting the harmony of polishing your short sword.


I can't take it anymore and decide to call her back. The phone says 12 missed calls. What nerve! She is the Pig's replacement, by the way.

I call her back on my home phone because reception in my house sucks. Yes, it was a dare. Go ahead, make my day if you ever call here. But I cannot use my cell phone at home.


""Oh. Hi, Samurai."" Like she is my bff. ""The clients can't get into the compyutor,"" she bleats. Her voice is high-pitched, simple and childish. She asks if I can get in remotely and fix it.


""You do not have a twenty four hour contract. And you may not call me at 9pm on Saturday night! I've asked you repeatedly to not call my cell phone, but you continue to call my cell phone. You will call the office and go through the proper channels."" I was upset. After the fiasco with Huey and her subsequent abuse, I had had it. Enough. This was the last time.


Still with some semblance of professionalism and concern for the customer, I calmed down and continued, 'You must be willing to perform basic troubleshooting yourself. Make an appointment, and I will teach you. You are our customer and we will take care of you but only during business hours. Do Not call my cell phone, call the office. You have the number.

Background: I work as a support agent for Xbox. We handle hardware issues in relation to the Xbox 360  and its accessories (among other things)

John (the customer) has an issue with his Xbox Headset. He can't hear anything out of it from what he tells me. He says he has a pair of turtle beach headset also (third party brand headset)

Not an uncommon issue. The headset has likely broken due to wear and tear but still, we have to test it to make sure before sending the customer a replacement.

Our conversation went somethink like this
_____________________________
Me: John do you know if you have the wireless headset or the wired one?

John: How do I find that out?

Me: .. Between your Xbox 360 controller and the headset there is either going to be a wire connecting them, or no wire at all.

John: I'm plugging the wire into my TV

**Me:** ??? John the headset doesn't go into any port on the TV. It's designed specifically for the port on the controller.

John: but I got this adapter with it so it'll work.

Me: John are you using the headset that came with your console or the turtle beach headset?

John: The Turtle beach head-

Me: John we don't support third party headsets. If you have an issue with them, you will have to contact the retailer or manufactuer. You said your xbox headset isn't working though, so I'd be happy to help you with that.

_____________________
So myself and John started troubleshooting the headset. I asked him to plug it into the controller and that we were going to send ourselves a message on xbox live so we could test the microphone and also the earpiece.

After what felt like an eternity trying to have him navigate to the messages feature, we started recording.

I asked him to hit record and to speak into the headset.

He asked me does he need to be wearing the headset for this.

I explained yes as we're now testing the device.

John hits record and beings to speak. ""My name is John ######. I live in ##### and Im having problems with my Xbox headse- Awh shit I clicked off it. Can you tell me how to get back there?!""

I had no problem helping John again, but I could hear his frustration only growing, but we were nearly there.

Or so I thought.. It took us TWO more tries to record his voice. He either accidentally pressed the wrong button and quit out of the menu or his headset wasn't plugged in properly. I was at the point where it was just uncomfortable to talk to him. He was so frustrated.

But alas we finally got there. We recorded his voice and he could hear the playback perfectly.

Me : ""Is there anything else I can help you with today John?""

John: ""Yes my xbox headset!!""

(Dafuq?)

Me: But john we can hear your voice through the headset which means the mic was working and the earpiece is working

John: Yes but that's on my turtlebeach headset!

**I couldn't believe it. 20 minutes trying to get him to record his voice and he uses the wrong headset**

Now he's pissed. Now I'm fed up but I try not to let him know that.

I said to john that this will only take a minute or two, we're going to just plug in the headset and try it with the new one.

I wish I could say we got it on the first go, but it took IIRC 3 times or him to be able to hear himself due to difficulties with the symbols for Play (sideways triangle) Stop (Square) and record (Red Circle).

So his headset could hear people, and the mic could pickup his voice.

I said it looked like the issue was resolved but he cut me off mid sentance shouting

""WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS. I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING IN THE GAME!""

I stopped speaking for a moment to gather my thoughts and then something critical occurred to me... he said ""in the game""

I asked him did mean he couldn't hear his games sound effects and dialogues and music while he was playing?

He roared ""what do you mean!?""

I explained the function of the headset and that it was only for communication between friends while on xbox live and that it could not transmit the audio from his TV to the headset.

He stopped talking for about 5 seconds and just said

""I'm going to have my nephew come over and look at this. My turtle beaches could play the sound from the TV. Why can't this?""

And then he hung up. Completely oblivious to what I said to him. 33 minutes of both our lives lost because John did not know what the function of the headset was for.

ender-_,19,13,1pza6z,54,"First time posting here, be gentle.

I work in a company that provides IT support to smaller businesses. A few years ago, one such client ordered 4 new laptops for their workers. Nothing fancy, but more than enough to run Office and the two programs they use for work. I set up all 4 of them (my Windows 7 SP1 image, Office, VPN, joined them to their domain, installed the two custom programs they use and verified that drive mappings work), delivered them, and moved users from their old computers. Everything went fine, users were happy to have new fast machines.

Two weeks later I get a call that one of the users has trouble accessing the shared drives and that the custom applications don't work. Troubleshooting through phone got me nowhere, and remote help didn't want to connect for some reason, so I went on site to check what's going on. When I get there, the user turned on the laptop, and logged in - but something was bothering me, even if I couldn't immediately tell what. After logging in, I was also informed that e-mail doesn't work. I start checking, and immediately notice that the desktop icons for their programs are missing (it wasn't really unusual - the icons were placed on user's desktop, and it wasn't unusual that they were deleted, either intentionally or by accident).

Check Computer - no mapped drives. Win+R, \\server - and I get a password prompt, this definitely wasn't normal. Next, I check the date and time, because I had authentication problems when those drifted too far apart from server, but they were fine. Start -&gt; right-click Computer, Properties - huh, why's there no SP1 installed? By then it wasn't too surprising that the computer had a different name, and that it wasn't part of the domain either (now I knew what bothered me during logon - her username looked different from standard). I ask the user (who definitely wasn't technical) if anybody else has used the computer, and after some back and forth she admits that her husband (who's IT support in *important faculty*) installed her digital camera last night (but only her digital camera!). Note that these users did not have admin rights on their laptops, but I never bothered with locking the BIOS, since pretty much none of them even know what those are for. I simply never imagined that somebody's spouse would do a nuke &amp; pave to get some camera drivers installed. Further check also showed that instead of Office 2010 there was now a pirate version of 2007 installed.

When I tried to explain why her computer wasn't working, and why what her husband did was something you simply don't do with equipment that isn't your, I was met with ""I don't understand what you're trying to tell me"" ""But my husband is in *important faculty* IT and knows what he's doing"" ""How would you feel if I started to tell you about a case from *my profession*?"" (I got the last one while explaining to her manager why I would have to take the laptop to be reimaged).

The archiving takes place at 6 hour intervals so the date and times of the files are irrelevant. It is a bit of a convoluted rule-based process. ""Just stop counting everything.""

He opens Outlook to search for an email that has a link to a spreadsheet. On one of the worksheets is a link to a shared folder that contains a folder of this particular system's documents. One of the Word documents in that folder has a link that opens IE to the system's logon page. I really should carry handkerchiefs.


He closes the Word doc and the folders, and goes back to the spreadsheet. On another worksheet is a link to another share of archives. He scrolls to this system's folder and opens it.


Back to the spreadsheet, he goes back to the first worksheet to find the same link to the same folder of documents that opens a goddamed spreadsheet with instructions on how to open the SQL table and run a script to count the entries in the last 24 hours.

As soon as she sits down she exclaims ""Woa, woa what did you do? You broke my computer"" I pondered that statement because everything was functionally correctly. ""That's windows 7, it looks a tad different but I assure you, it's a much faster and clean work environment"" She didn't like that. ""No, the background is different, the mouse doesn't work right, I can't find any of my photos and my internet is missing"" I changed the background to her liking, adjusted the mouse speed settings, located her personal folders and insured her Ethernet connection was secure. She then said "" No, my blue internet is still missing""...........(yeah) Instead of explaining to her the benefits of using Firefox or Chrome, I put the IE icon back on her desktop.....she was finally happy.

A whole week goes with this guy pestering me every other day about where his printer is and how he really needs it to do his job.  Chased up Yesterday and today, nothing.

Eventually the supplier sent me a POD.  Who's it signed by?  The guy who wants the damn thing.  He put it in our returns bay, not realising it was his printer.  (Despite the big-ass pictures of the printer on all 4 sides of the box).

So, mystery solved.  Install the printer and he's good to go.  Whilst I'm installing it he's asking why this printer is a different model to his old one.  Explained that his old one was discontinued and this one was better.

""The toner cartridge looks small, is that the right cartridge?""  

""Yes, it's the right cartridge, or else it wouldn't be printing off these test pages right now.""

""Why did you do that?"" 

""Well I think it was too small and wanted to have a look but can't get it back in now""

""How did you take it out?""

""Just pulled it out, I think it was jammed in.""

Thedonkey5497,19,32,1pz3nv,131,"About two years ago, I got the summer job of my dreams.It was at a small motel in rural Sweden. The pay was awesome, at least for someone who had one year until graduation and lived in a small apartment in the suburbs. I loved with. Most of the costumers. were nice and often, I just sat at my computer, watching a movie or something.

Three weeks passed without anything happened. I learn my way around the place and I soon knew it like the back of my hand. I often chatted with the people staying at the motel, mostly fishers, sailers or so on.

Well, suddenly, we are overflowing with bookings. Summer vacations for the rich people has begun. This is a great place for sailing, fishing or any kind of water sports really. Water sports are for rich people in Sweden.

All of a sudden I had a lot to do. I seem to have become the general IT-wizard which the posh and rich people who eat oysters for Monday dinner saw me as a slave. Worst of all were the rich children. The ones who complained about *everything*. One special kid stayed with me for quite a while.

A blonde brat appears at my desk, wearing some very fancy clothes. The following occurs.

&gt; **ME** Can I help you?

&gt; **BRAT** Someone hacked my computer. 

He places a Mac on the desk. The poor machine has suffered a life of abuse and hate. It is covered in scratches, the ports are all filled with... Well who knows, really? As he places it on the desk, one of the keys fall off.

&gt; **ME** Erm... What do you mean with *hacked*?

What am I supposed to say? I'm flabbergasted at the state of the poor thing. I'm beginning to suspect that it might indeed have been hacked with an axe or something...

&gt; **BRAT** It won't start. That means it's hacked.

I can't contain myself anymore, I let out a snicker, but manage to hide it behind a cough.

&gt; **ME** And how long has it been looking like that?

I point at all the scratches, and so on.

&gt; **BRAT** Oh, it's always looked like that. I've had it in my bag and it just became like that

&gt; **ME** So, you've never actually cared about being careful with your computer?

It's a really expensive one, too. I have an old Dell as my travel laptop and it's being treated like a king. But compared to this, my laptop looks like beggar  in rags. 

Not breaking eye contact, I pick up the computer and handed it back to him. He looks a bit confused for a moment.

&gt; **ME** It's not hacked, it's broken. Macs are fragile and keeping one in your bag... I guess the bag isn't waterproof. It died because of the abuse. 

I thought that would be that as Brat stormed off with his poor Mac under his arm. I'm stunned about how careless people can be with their computers. I shook my head and went back to watching my movie. 

About one hour later, Brat returns and this time, Brat's father is there too. 

&gt; **ME** Can I help you gentlemen? If the food wasn't of your liking, I suggest you talk to the chef.

I can see Dad's blood pressure rise. 

&gt; **DAD** You called my son a careless slob and a lier. I'll have you fired.

&gt; **ME** Too bad, you're too late, my contract only lasts until the end of next month. And I suggest you teach your son some basic how-to-care-about-technology skills. Now, if you don't mind, I'm at the end of my movie and you're kind of ruining it.

I got a call and I my usual spiel and asked what the problem is:

""I have a voucher for 2.1 million dollars in my hands.  What do I do? ""

Now funnily enough, it wasn't entirety uncommon for venues to print of a million or so dollar voucher by accident. So after notifying my team leader I asked them to pay it out in the terminal. 

""I can't, there is no barcode"" 

""Ok, can you pay it out manually?""

""No, there is no serial number. It just says cash out""

So pulled up their transactions and no luck, I couldn't find anything from the terminal anywhere near $2.1 million. 

I then pulled up their financial reports for that day to see what had happened and I saw the $2.1 million dollar cash out. 

Our scripts for troubleshooting were found by keywords and unfortunately ""cash out"" was a hard phrase to find. So I checked with the team, no one had any clue of this type of transaction, even the finance department didn't know what I was talking about. 

It was out job to know these terminals backwards and forwards and no one knew about this transaction. The terminals were about 20 years old so there were some buried functions that hadn't been used in years and it seems they found one. 

I had a look on the terminals we had on site to see if I could find out what happened and stumbled across the transaction and found the inverse transaction to cancel out the millions of dollars. 

I described how to fix the issue and we get them to balance on their reports. 

I then send an email to the bean counters to notify them that we found the money and to not worry about the multi million dollar transactions going on. 

It turns out that they were actually trying to pay out someones voucher and weren't quite familiar with the system. They managed to find the obscure function and then scan the barcode into the number field which then proceeded the transaction. 

It isn't as entertaining as some of the others on this sub, this one has stuck with me due to the shear amount of money that someone managed to lose.

She calls the office last Friday from home stating that she is not able to connect to her home wifi. I run through the usual checklist of items. When we go into her device manager and look at the wireless NIC properties, its giving her a ""This device cannot start. (Code 10)"" error in the status box. I have her uninstall the device and check for hardware changes. It reinstalls her WiFi NIC and, after a reboot, states that the device is now working properly. Still no wireless connections. Nothing is showing other than a VPN and dial-up option.
  
I'm thinking ok, my boss handled this last time and said he just let windows search the hard drive to reinstall the driver. So I let her know that I'll have to take a look at it on Monday when she's back in the office, as she doesn't have an internet connection to download an uncorrupted driver from the dell website.  
  
So Monday rolls around and I get into the office to take a look at her laptop. I download the newest driver from Dell, completely wipe the old driver from her system, and reinstall. I'm still not getting any SSIDs to show in the connections window. I look at the wireless cutoff switch and sure enough, its in the off position. So I leave her office knowing that the issue is fixed. I let her know that its working again and that she should test it at home that night.  
  
Flash forward to a few minutes ago when she calls in from another site saying she's unable to connect to the wifi there. I ask her what options are showing in the connections window and sure enough, just the VPN and dial-up options. So I politely asked her 3 times if the wifi cutoff switch was in the correct position. To which I get angry replies of: ""Of course I've checked that already!""

My cousin (19 yrs old) and her have the same cell phone, the GS2. They are up for contract renewal at the end of December/beginning of January, so they will be getting new phones at that point. 


Now the story:

Aunt sits down beside me: Biohazard, can you **BELIEVE** that cousin has used up 75% of his data already?!?

Me: Okay, so what? I use around that amount. It resets on a monthly basis, so don't worry too much as your new billing date is today.

Aunt: NO! That's not how my plan works!! I have X amount of data (she couldn't remember how much) for the entire 2 year duration of my plan!! Can you believe he managed to use 75% of it?! I've never used that much and I'm always on Facebook and Twitter!!!!

Me: No, that's not how they set up plans, and if that's how yours is you've been screwed. Check your phone bill next month, and you'll likely see everything is fine.

Her: Well, whatever, this is stupid. I can't wait to get us new phones in a couple of months so this doesn't happen again!

Me: Um, this could happen again on your new phone (GS4)... It works the same on the data plan that your current phone does.

Her: NO! Because then he'll have more space on his phone and we won't reach 75% again!

It was a normal summer.  The hippies and their 5 piece band were across the street corner in front of the Library playing their Tuba, Bagpipe, Flute, Sitar, and Castanet's for money.  The Crackhouse across the street had been calm for nearly 3 weeks.  Yet, something unexpected lurked beneath the calm tranquility that is Tech Support Land.  


I walked into work that morning, and everyone was sort of whistling and looking around all suspicious like.  I was confused, but since pranks amongst us were not uncommon, I double-checked all my stuff.  Clean.  My hosts file had no silly redirects to sites like Zombo.  I didn't have hidden noise makers in my desk or taped to my chair.  Turns out they had messed with my keyboard settings and had the E key mapped to the sleep function.


Then the financial officer's husband walked through with a big grin on his face, carrying a long box under his arm.  I was curious, but didn't ask as it was time for me to get to the queue and answer calls. 


I forget about everything until near lunchtime, when his wife walks into his office, and I hear her chewing him out over something.  I finish my call, and turn around to see what is going on.  He had mounted a very tall, sturdy metal pole to his desk.  It still hadn't dawned on me yet.  


He starts off what eventually turns into 2 days of bad jokes/puns with the following wisecrack: ""You see this tool in my hand?"" *picks up a wire stripper*  ""It is a wire stripper.  I need a dancing stripper, and here is the tool for it!"" as he points to the pole.

ninnabadda,31,20,1px2e8,127,"So I provide tech support for enterprise-level web clusters at a web hosting company.  I regularly deal with clusters that have replicated web nodes, remote high-availability databases, their own private networks, etc.  A lot of our customers host maybe a single, large application across these clusters, or are development teams offering some up-time redundancy to their clients.  

However, some of our customers don't want to deal with development or administration and would rather just focus on making money.  Often times, this train of thought leads them to an excellent ""get rich quick"" scheme:  

Step 1) Make junk site and put ads on it.
Step 2) Purchase ""relevant search traffic"" to then visit your site and click your ads.
Step 3) PROFIT

Which of course always works out and turns your cluster into a perpetual money machine.

So one of these clients called in one day, freaking out because he said that they weren't getting the amount of traffic they were supposed to.  We knew that they were most likely buying their traffic but didn't say anything because a) it would be kind of rude and b) whenever we got close to saying it, they vehemently denied it so it wasn't going to be a fruitful path anyway.  I told the customer I would look into it, opened a ticket, and hung up the phone.

I get a call again a couple of hours later and this time it was from the VP of the company (it turns out the guy before was the CEO) and I can tell he's a pretty cool guy cause he says stuff like ""lets get to the facts of the situation"" and ""our traffic providers are reputable, it can't possibly be them.""

The first 20 minutes of the call consisted of him telling me how much money they were losing, which is a great plan when the tech you're talking to makes as much money in a year as you are spending monthly on servers.  I explain to him that I'd just spent the last couple of hours reviewing traffic graphs (both in packet throughput and bandwidth) on his servers, the public rack switch he was connected to, and the border of our network and did not see any dropped packets, errors, or bandwidth loss from the edge of our network to his servers.  One possibility, I said, was that Apache was denying some of their traffic once it actually got to the web nodes but I didn't see any messages like that in the error log at this time.  I added that if he could get me an IP or two from which some of the traffic was supposed to be coming, I could look more deeply into it and perhaps determine what was going wrong.  And then the bomb dropped:

""We can't do that, our traffic doesn't use IPs.""

I literally went silent for about 20 seconds and when I started to speak again, my speech was halting and careful like if you were trying to talk a psycho serial killer out of stabbing you.

Me: ""Well, sir... uh.... you see..... all traffic uses IPs, that's how the computers know where to find each other so they can talk.""
VP: ""Yeah, I know, ours doesn't use those so we can't get a list for you.""

At this point, I facepalmed so hard I think I gave myself a concussion and began to suspect that this had to be a joke.  But no.  About 24 hours later the CEO sent us some stats in a massive excel sheet showing the relationship between ""hits"" and ""clicks"" which clearly showed that some fairly meaningless numbers had been getting smaller over the last couple of days.  This was accompanied by an 800MB excel sheet of IP addresses which were apparently the one or two IPs I'd asked for earlier.

It took us two or three days of talking to them before they finally agreed to speak to their traffic company, who shall remain nameless but whose explanation of services included such terms as:

""semantic categorization and clusterization"" 
""search and dynamic behavioral retargeting
""ad exchange pipeline optimization""

Turns out their traffic provider just wasn't living up to our customer's expectations and they'd been having some issues with their ""semantic search traffic filtering"" or whatever.  Of course, this didn't stop them from being mad at us and leaving for another webhost.  You can't win 'em all I guess.

tl;dr: Customer says they are losing some of their paid traffic (not in so many words though).  I don't see any packet loss whatsoever from the edge of our network all the way to their servers or any errors on the server itself indicating application failure.  I ask for a couple of IPs to test with and the customer says that their traffic doesn't come from IPs.  I give them the data I have, customer doesn't believe me and proceeds to migrate to another service when it turns out we were right, that their traffic provider was not providing the traffic it was supposed to be.","Quoth the VP, ""Our traffic doesn't use IP Addresses.""",147

BrotherBlitz,18,12,1pwwvs,74,"I work at a Managed Services company. We're a tiny understaffed team with too many clients, not enough money and a very lazy owner who ""doesn't want to know about it"". He's still in his early thirties but acts like he's ""paid his dues all his life"" and now behaves like he is semi-retired. 


Anywhoo, back to the actual rant at hand. We have a client who had encountered a major issue with their email server. Somehow a user account was compromised, and using this account, bots from China and Africa started sending out tens of thousands of spam emails from their IP address, thus resulting in other mail servers and spam lists on the internet eventually refusing mail from their email server. We didn't catch this until it was far too late, with thousands of emails being stuck in the mail queue, and log files indicating refused connections from the other side, over and over again. 


This caused a week of hell so to speak, with most staff literally being unable to send emails out to external recipients. I was hired at an ""entry level position"", so inevitably it was my job to take all the abuse from the angry and frustrated users while our most senior tech worked quietly in the background to find a resolution. 


We finally fix the problem, but over the next few weeks I was consistently receiving tickets along the lines of ""Email Server Down???!!?"" from staff whenever anything happened on their machines, even if the problem was extremely minor and unrelated to email. 


One of the tickets I received was at end of day, from a middle management level user complaining that he had ""not received a single external email all day and that it was very suspicious"". 


We had made some improvements since the big crisis with the email server which included a ""cloud based email spam filter"". MX records point to this server for all incoming mail, and all outgoing mail also is forced through the spam filter. One of the many benefits of this new service is being able to check message logs and review emails for all users in a nice and simple GUI - A huge help with ""troubleshooting email delivery issues"" for users. 

So I immediately look in to this issue for our friend in middle management and see that it's been an unusually slow day for emails, but everything has without a doubt been delivered to his mailbox. I call back within 5 minutes of receiving his ticket to reassure him and explain that everything is hunkey dorey with his email. He doesn't answer the phone. I get a little frustrated when this happens, because I just want to get tickets out of the queue as quickly as possible, especially when they're not actual issues. 

We have remote support capability that allows us to silently view the user's screen in addition to actually taking control. So I open up a window to this client machine and I see the user on his web browser, checking out Arnold Schwarzenegger soundboards and clicking on buttons to trigger famous Arnold quotes. I called his desk phone a couple more times while watching him waste away his Friday afternoon on his company computer. I knew his phone was literally a few inches from his mouse hand (with caller ID), so he was intentionally letting it ring off the hook. 

I was so frustrated at seeing first hand this user's complete disregard for my time (especially after a long hard week of me wiping users noses) that I just closed his ticket without explanation and left for the day. ",A user's time is always more important than yours.,86

Gambatte,25,24,1pwfor,102,"Recently, I was tasked with writing a SQL Script to replace the manual process for creating new units in the database. The time-consuming manual process had to be repeated for each unit, and when several hundred new units are expected to arrive from the manufacturer soon, it only makes sense to enter them automagically, eliminating human error from the initial set-up and configuration routine.

I got the script up and working fairly quickly, using a basic copy-and-paste method of an existing configured blank unit.

As I was going back through the script, I was struck by a thought. And lo, a golden halo did descend from the clouds to hover gently above my head as I spake aloud: ""I shall not only comment the script I have created, but instead of just using arbitrary figures without explanation or reference, I shall endeavour to create those numbers instead so that any who shalt follow in my footsteps can most easily examine how those numbers hast been reached.""

Oh, how I would pay for my hubris...

Everything was proceeding smoothly (and that should have been my first warning that Murphy was about to make his presence felt) until I got the generation of the IP configuration. The IP address and port number is stored as a BINARY(6). Simple enough, parse the IP address to binary, tack the port number on the end with a '+ CAST(@PORT_NUMBER AS BINARY(2))' and call it a day, right?

Nope.

Turns out, the software developer had messed up a simple decimal to binary conversion; the first byte was divided by 255, not 256. As the port number was over 10,000, the second byte was significantly larger than expected...

&gt; Example: If the port was 10,000, the expected result would be 0x2710.

&gt; However, using the bugged code, the result is 0x2737; the equivalent of 10,039.

To make matters worse, the software developer had been advising the firmware development team during the initial design phase. Unable to believe that he would make such a simple mistake, he doubled down and got the firmware team to alter their code to match his (the firmware source files actually still have the correct code commented out).

So this bug now resides not only on every one of the servers, but also in the embedded firmware of every one of the remote units.

Faced with the prospect of:

* making the developer acknowledge his error,

* fix his code,

* fix the firmware, and

* roll out a near simultaneous firmware and software update,

I instead raised my head from desk, entered the bugged code into my script with extensive comments as to why it was being done this way, created a new ticket for the bug, and closed the script creation job.

homsikpanda,66,22,1pw9ss,52,"hello TFTS, i've wandered your subreddit a few times and this just happened and i felt the need to post it. warning this is a bit of a rant.

backstory: i'm a supervisor for a phone company, i deal with the ""difficult"" customers or those wanting refunds, or appeasements because our device is too difficult to comprehend, things like that.

so i get a call from a customer who purchased a small aditional storage plan about a month ago, and then decided this wasn't enough storage and decided to upgradeto the next largest storage plan.

here's the first catch: when you upgrade you get charged the full price  of the storage you are upgrading to and refunded the previous purchase amount.

customer - lets call her bad with money (hence forth BWM) 
decided they would purchase storage now (instead of waiting till thursday when they get paid) and of course were charged full amount for increased storage, this put their bank account into over draft, and they were then charged an overdraft fee
so they call in wanting me to pay for the over draft fee... 
as a policy we #1 do not refund charges from third parties, and #2 do not give monetary appeasements, if you want stuff from us you have to settle with picking something from the website, nuff said, you're not getting any actual money from us, period!

anyway BWM is pretty much in tears by the time she speaks to me (had to go thru a few of our frontline agents) and wants us to pretty much pay her $40 because she didn't realize that when you buy something, it charges you full price for your purchase.

it's been a slow day, i'm pretty bored so i decide to be nice and try to help her, i could have very easily just said ""we don't give refunds for your stupid mistakes"" but i offered her an appeasement of equal value from our online store, nope not good enough i need money because ""i need to put food on my table""

she then trys to figure out ways she can take an item and return it to our store or even a different store (like walmart) for money...which i explain, no, that's not possible, we're sending you a $40+ item for free as an appeasement, it doesn't come with a receipt, if you're LUCKY the best you can do is return it to a different non-us store and they might give you instore credit (which you still don't get your $40 that you so desperately need) and it takes a week to get the item anyway, so you'll be paid before them.
still trying to be nice i even explained you can sell the item on ebay if you really wanted to, but no, this was too much effort for BWM.

i even offered to refund her purchase and had to suppress the urge multiple times to explain that if we refunded the purchase your bank will most likely refund the over draft as well.

the call ended with her stating she's going to bring the phone back to where she bought it to return it and buy a different phone.

atleast when she returns it she'll get her $40 back &gt;.&gt;

but seriously, how bad with money do you have to be to #1 decide that virtual storage is more important then food, and #2 it's so important you can't wait the 3 days till you get paid to purchase it. 

**TL:DR - women tries to get use to pay for her inability to do math.**

~~edit: if anybody knows how to edit the title please let me know &gt;.&gt;;~~ (thank you!)

2nd edit: some people seem to be confused with the upgrading:
how it works (while attempting to not give away my company) 
if you buy 10gigs of storage, then 1 month -2 months hell even 9 months down the road decide ""i need more storage"" you then would go and buy 20 gigs of storage, this then over rides the 10 gigs you already purchased, refunds it, and removes those 10 gigs, and instead gives you 20 gigs, it's how the system works because it's easier when you purchase 10 gigs, you get 10 gigs, you purchase 20 gigs, you get 20 gigs, you purchase 50 gigs, you get 50 gigs, instead of having the system trying to do a shit ton of math because i purchased eight 5 gig packages, then a 20 gig, and then a 10 gig, so i should have 100 gigs now right? (no...no you shouldn't...our system dislikes math like that and we're not going to do math like that for the several billion customers we have &gt;.&gt; ) what you buy is what you get..... 

it's like if i went to a store and bought a shirt that was too small(for 50% off), so i go back to the store and buy another shirt that's bigger(for full price)...i still have to pay full price for the bigger shirt... but i get to return the small shirt (either before or after purchasing the bigger shirt) and get my money back on that purchase. our system does the return automatically if/when you get a bigger storage package

edit #3 -HOLY SHIT I'M ON THE FRONT PAGE! \\@O@// FIRST TIME EVER!!! WHHHOOO!!!!

**UPDATE:** she called me back(left a voice mail) and wants to speak to my non-existent higher ups. while this isn't entirely worthy of an update. she mentioned on the voice mail that she was charged $40 in over draft fees, and is now $80 in over draft.... (our storage plan is $42.50) sssoooo this means she bought the storage plan without any money in her account at all, which i had assumed previously, but as i couldn't confirm this fact i omitted it (i don't like to spread facts i can't confirm ) this just further cements my assumption that BWM is bad with money/math.
i called her back (because i'm at least trying to be helpful D:, i can't give you cash in hand but i can give you $40 worth of merchandise, hell if you asked i'd probably give you up to $100 in merchandise ) she gets to speak with my customer relations department, which while technically a move down the ladder, they have different procedures and abilities then what i have, i'll post more as i find out more.",no we i'm not giving you free money because you overdrafted your account.,74

lumpy_potato,18,28,1pvkwq,119,"So this happened a while back, and the company since started using Google Drive + Google Apps for keeping files organized and sync'd between multiple collaborators and having better permissions control, but for a period of time, the go-to 'I need to share this' solution was Dropbox.

For those of you unfamiliar, Dropbox is a pretty straightforward file storage service that can be relatively easy for keeping and sharing files, where necessary. I've used it personally for sharing large audio/video/photo files that were too big for e-mail, and it worked well for the purpose.

Anyways, my previous company was a software house, so there was a lot of documentation, business plans, how-to-guides, and other miscellaneous things stuffed into that dropbox folder. This was a small company that got very big, very quickly - something like an office of 5 people working out of the now-CTO's living room to having three offices and 150 employees within 2 years.

Of course, such growth necessarily means no one tended the documentation of any of the core software libraries, so that was my job.

As the process of documentation began, and I started pulling files out of Dropbox for review, we began adding more people to the dropbox share in order to review and update materials in general. 

Dropbox has an...interesting feature. Maybe its no longer like this, maybe we did something wrong, but at the time, when you downloaded the Dropbox app and sync'd a folder to your computer, that folder was *on your computer* - meaning changes to it were instantly sync'd to Dropbox, and to other people connected to that folder.

Now, this might seem good on its face (I think Google Drive is similar in this case), but there was a really big issue - if you wanted to *remove* a dropbox folder, you had to do it through the dropbox app - and NOT by using the delete button. This wasn't obvious right from the get-go, and would very quickly lead us to troubled waters.

Unfortunately, the instructions were not clear, and in addition to various trapped genitalia, someone deleted the entire repository, hoping to clear several gigs of data off their computer. I was the first to realize it, pinging the engineer in charge of the original repository with a single, nard-chilling sentence: ""I think our documentation folder is gone."" The aftermath was slow, as at first people just assumed that the drive wasn't updating fast enough. Then came concern, followed swiftly by panic. 

You see, those core libraries were old - old enough where only two or three developers out of dozens really knew how the hell to get them to work, and while I had some of them documented for the newer versions, our legacy apps (which we had very large contracts for, and were working on at the time) were running wholly on the ever-changing will of Murphy's Law, and lacking the documentation for 'what was that library supposed to do again?' essentially translated into days or weeks lost troubleshooting the old code. This was in addition to the collection of old engineering files related to design, testing, and plans for future releases, nevermind the creative repository of old audio/video graphics.

Luckily, dropbox allows you to restore to a previous version, so not all was lost. But the engineer responsible for the dropbox folder (and one of the original members of the company) decided this would be a good lesson to be taught to the developers, who all too often would absentmindedly do something or another and, ignoring documentation or established procedure, proceed to muck up a simple problem and make it worse. So he let them sweat over the problems for a day before restoring to the previous version, noting that in the future, developers would do well to read the documentation provided for all systems, as neither he nor the other veterans felt very much like spending additional late night hours staring at our aging Jenkins machine trying to figure out which one of dozens of common errors the developer had made, ignoring all previous warnings that had been given time and time again

Needless to say, I worked to get our core documentation off Dropbox, and it was eventually moved to a combination of local storage and google drive. The old libraries were eventually migrated to newer, cleaner ones, new documentation was written, common developer errors were logged and best practices released, all easily available, announced, and shared in such a way that as long as someone took the time to read everything, they would be able to code in peace and harmony, without fear of nuking an entire repository by hitting the delete button, or adding a library that would grind all development to a painful halt.

So of course, no one ever read any of it, and our tiny little corner of coding paradise remained, in many ways, the chaotic garden of post-apple Eden that I and many others came to love and adore.

Note: Some of you might feel our devs were bad, but they really weren't - we had great developers. But as I've come to understand it, great developers can still make silly mistakes, and when it comes to core code libraries (especially older ones whose requirements are dictated by upper-level management/marketing), sometimes what should be a simple integration is something far more complicated. I am happy to report that prior to my departure they transitioned to something far more 'whoops' proof.",Why Dropbox is bad for collaboration,147

Her friends decided to use some cards similar to tarot where you pick a card and read what to do out of a book.  One of them picked a card about clearing your chakras and calling upon some archangel to descend into you to clear your soul.  So she raises her hands to the air and says something to the effect of ""Archangel, I call upon you to descend into me and clear my chakras and make me one with the universe.""

As soon as they are done talking, another lady's iphone goes ""boop!!""   Terrified, the all look at the phone.  Which has, all on its own, written a text to my mother that looks something like this:

Gus-Man,42,40,1pv8l2,182,"Longtime lurker etc.

Background: I am an ICT for a government school in my state/territory/province. My job is 40% desktop support, 40% equipment maintenance, 10% website management, and 10% running audio gear for small school events (just for fun.) This being a government school however, its IT assets are officially overseen by a larger government department. Thus, if there’s any problem that is over my lever or requires permissions that I don’t have, there can be a lot of red tape and waiting involved (e.g. I received a call today following up on a ticket I had logged over a month ago and received no response from.. I had to inform them that the teacher who’s laptop it concerned had left the country and thus the laptop was unavailable)

Story setup: Our school owns a collection of 2 dozen or so iPads (intended for educational use but used mostly for keeping kids entertained) that I am in charge of keeping updated with apps and OS software. Now when iOS7 rolled out, our school was one of the few smart enough to not update all our iPads right away and wait until some major bugs had been identified and fixed.

Around the time that iOS7 was rolled out (in-fact, the day after it was made available in this country,) the government’s servers started to experience a huge amount of drain on their bandwidth. Some bright engineers there were able to put two and two together and figure out that everyone with a personal apple device was trying to update their software on the government schools internet (incidentally, the amount of data downloaded on the school iPads is comparatively small since only one copy of each piece of software is downloaded to the central computer and then dispersed to the iPads with Apple Configurator) and so they blocked access to the apple update servers. This was a fair enough action and I sent an email to IT operations saying such and asking when the servers would be white-listed so I could continue doing my job of keeping the iPads that they bought up and running? their reply was something to the tune of ‘never.’ I asked them if they were kidding and politely pointed out how many devices were being used in my school (and the other schools I was aware about) that would be rendered completely useless by this policy and recommended no less than three other solutions that would allow them to both block the bulk of traffic to these servers, and allow me and every other ICT in schools to get on with their jobs. To that email I received a very polite email saying something to the tune of “thank you for your suggestions Gus-Man, we will do what we can” and a few weeks later, was told that they would white-list the websites between the hours of 5pm and 6 am each day (?!?!) which is of no use to me as I am employed on a part time basis.

And there ends my rant (for now.) I haven’t given up but communication with these departments can take for ever.","iPads, AppleConfig and Bureaucracy at it’s finest!",222
ThatLightingGuy,62,110,1puolo,427,"Hey all. Long time, etc. I do not do direct computer support, but rather work in pro audio, video, and lighting retail and support for a small company. I'm the first contact for pretty much everything, including the emergency after-hours service.

I have a customer who recently bought a smallish audio mixer from us. This mixer has a USB send/receive bus, which is great for their application (web video streaming of live sports). Despite claiming to work as an engineer at a radio station, this particular user has had a number of issues:

1. Called to complain the headsets were not working right. Arrive on site only to see he has plugged the headphones into the line input jacks on the mixer.

2. Called again to complain that the USB audio wasn't working. Arrived on site again to see that the USB cable was not even connected. 

Anyways, this morning at some ungodly hour, the customer calls my cell phone:

C: I'm super pissed off. This cable you sold me to connect my phone to the mixer broke and we have a game in an hour.

Me: Well, that sucks, but there's a lifetime warranty on the cable, so I'll bring you another.

C: You don't get it. The end broke off in my phone's audio jack.


Now, I've seen this before. You have to put some pretty serious force into that cable to get it to snap off in there. I decide to call him out:


Me: I've sold hundreds of those cables. They don't snap easily, did you catch it on something? 

C: No, the end just slipped right off. This is a $700 phone, and you're going to buy me a new one.

Me: Well, I doubt that. But bring it to the shop tomorrow, and I'll have a look.


I've let my manager know about this, but after my history with this guy, I can imagine he's trying to rip us off. He'll be by tomorrow, so I'll update :)

And as a side note, the remedy to this, if you ever encounter it, is a dab of crazy glue on a finishing nail. Little drop (don't touch the sides of the jack!), let it set up, and pull the busted end off.","I'm sorry, you did what?",537

This accounting firm got it, got the threatening letter, wiped their server because they knew they had a good backup via carbonite.

The tech decided to use a privately managed key instead of letting Carbonite manage it, presumably for extra security.

He can't remember the password.

The number of ways he fucked up is truly astounding.

The owner has been blowing up my phone, desperately hoping there's some way to crack the 1024-bit encryption.

All I can suggest is that she tell the NSA that Edward Snowden sent her these files and ask what should she do with them.

Edit: OMG. Ok, so I got some more information.

1. Right when it happened, the owner asked the tech if it would be a good idea to clone the drive, then pay the money and that way the person who would supposedly log in and decrypt the files (not sure if that's how it works but that's what she said) wouldn't have access to the server. He (the tech) said it wasn't worth it.

2. Right after it happened, they started to restore files from the Carbonite backup, one by one. It was taking so long that the tech said it was inefficient. That's why he wiped the server to get the full backup.

3. He has apparently spent the last 8 hour or so trying every password he could remember with no luck.

4. I'm going to try to throw hashcat at it and see what happens. I have a couple of GTX680s so hey, maybe we'll get lucky. I don't actually know how to do it yet, but I'm researching like a fiend. I don't need to crack the key, I just need to get his password from it. This might be a total dead-end, but Jesus, I feel like I need to do something.

5. This company does my company's payroll. I feel like I should throw that out there, just because it makes the situation so much funnier. Or not.

6. I wish I could tell you the name of the company. I really do. The irony is so thick I could cut it with a banana.

I'm a snapping fiend, nothing of real interest, but I like taking pics and sending them out to the world.

Shit. I forgot one thing. I said to the owner, ""Well, it sucks, but at least you can go to your email and get the files. I'm sure your Outlook PST wasn't encryped.""

""I don't send anything through email because it's not secure.""

I had to mute the phone.

- - - - -

Scene in - a blissful Thursday afternoon, with me in my corner office, the boss out of the office thanks to his kid being newly born, the juices from the Keurig flowing... yes, truly a day worth of Elysium. However, an urgent call to the project manager changed all that, and he came storming into my office as though he were possessed.

""Jack,"" he began, in his Nigerian accent, ""I need you to go to $CLIENT_NAME.""

""Pray tell, why?"" I muttered, quietly sipping at my coffee and playing Sins of a Solar Empire. ""You are aware $BOSS_NAME ordered me not to leave the office if I could avoid it, and you're to send bitch-boy, yes?""

""I know. You're the only one who deals with shit like this, though,"" he said, continuing on through a blissful haze of unawareness.

""What did they do?"" I said quietly, picking up the Aperture Science mug on my desk. ""I will not appreciate driving out to bumfuck nowhere for them because they decided to fuck around, or the cosmic shitstain they call a director of IT fucked up again."" I raised my voice. ""I do not suffer fools lightly, Isaac!""

He obviously didn't get it, and informed me of the situation, though delicately, no doubt to avoid offending my sensibilities (ha).

The firm had a suite of in-house coders, and all but the lead developer had quit en masse over the week. The lead developer had turned in his immediate resignation this afternoon, but the stupid bastard thought he had locked his machine beyond what we could do to get into it. On top of that, they'd all taken their code and started a rival firm, one specifically dedicated to doing what the original firm did, but they hadn't made the modifications to their contracts that I had, and the lawyers were soon to get involved.

I sighed and packed up my kit, then drove through the beautiful Austin hillsides to reach the firm in question. The last remaining developer was there in his office with the incompetent head of IT looking on frantically, and a huge shit-eating grin was on his face.

The head of IT pointed me towards the developer's two machines, and with a slight smirk, I powered them on, noticing the huge grin on the dev's face.

""Oh, a BIOS password. Well. It's not as if I haven't seen these since I was in high school."" I ripped the jumpers off the machines' motherboards, resetting the BIOS passwords. The developer's face fell a little, going from total elation to mostly lolwut.jpg, and I booted to TuxPE off my USB key (shameless plug, since I wrote the damn thing) and removed the local admin password via NTPWEdit.

After a quick reboot, followed with a login session as local admin, I added the Domain Admins group back to local admins (aww, it was cute, he thought he could beat me), then rebooted the machine and started a disk image.

I turned to the lead developer, whose face had suddenly developed a thousand-yard stare, and smirked. ""And that, my good man, is why you don't bet against a Bastard Operator."" I made special care to emphasize the capitals, and his jaw dropped when he heard the term. ""Chuck, care to escort him out and call the lawyers?""

The portly head of IT used his considerable bulk to escort the lead developer out, and with a grin, I RDP'd to the domain controller (I built it into TuxPE) and reset the lead developer's password, then shamelessly looted a few shots of the high-end whisky (Glenfiddich) I knew that the head of IT kept in his desk drawer.

A short drive later, I was back at my desk, and able to tell the story to my coworkers, to their infinite amusement.

    ‹Herp› if it wasn't fixed then how am i on here
    ‹Me› just because you can use it doesn't mean it's fixed.
    ‹Herp› so im on a broken laptop?
    ‹Me› if it's erratically making noises, which I would assume is a dying hard disk,
    and thus causing a bugcheck, then yes
    ‹Me› you're on a broken laptop

I'm sorry, but I've lost a lot of patience for these sorts of things.

TL;DR: If it's broken and making noises, surely if I ignore it, it'll go away and be fixed because magic!

&gt;Dear Help Desk,
 
&gt;Is there any way for me to prevent getting a pop-up  message which comes onto my screen about every 5 to 10 minutes and which reads: “Updates to your computer are nearly complete; to complete the process you need to restart your computer.” Then there are 2 buttons: “Restart Now” and “Restart Later”.

and angry customers as far as the queue could scroll.
Outages and email conversions were flowing like the coffee
through my veins. I thought I would make it through the day 
unscathed. My dreams were shattered when the Harpie called.

Yelling and screaming like banshee because her dsl connection was down I arm myself with my best fake smile and I will help you if it kills
you attitude. Battling to gather basic information, modem model number light readout, and physicals.

The phone cord, the poor, poor defenseless phone cord. I ask the Harpie if she would check the phone cord to make sure it was connected. I am met with a wall of venom from deep within her gullet. Phrases like ""I  already checked that and it's fine."" She followed that up with a dagger like verbal projectile ""I actually work on computers, I know what I'm talking about.""

*Now TFTS, this is where I lost my composure. This was a no sync call which meant check filters and phone lines. This particularly colorful Harpie wanted me to fix the connection. However, she didn't seem to want to take the basic steps. I, out of character, told her that if she really was a pc tech then she should understand why I was troubleshooting in the direction that I was.*

The Harpie was stunned, almost silenced. I took the advantage and advised the Harpie that her issue would be escalated to repair since I could not solve no sync over the phone. Harpie made a quick counter with well **I** will see if **I** can get it fixed.

Before the phone could be cradled again, she ends with ""I think my daughter kicked the phone cord out."" She decides she wants to troubleshoot on her own and will call back if she gets it fixed.

**Epilogue**
About 10 minutes later she called back, the queue gods smiled on me an it rang to me. She apologized for being angry and for her behavior. He daughter had in fact kicked the phone cord out of the wall jack.

pizzaboy192,14,20,1pq29i,66,"I am a senior in college. I keep a media server running Plex in my parent's basement. By doing this, I may have spoiled them. Yesterday I was battling a digestive tract issue and get a text from my father. 

""The server isn't working right. Can you fix it?""

I have everything set up for remote access. I hop onto the server, see that my younger brother has been using the main hypervisor account for Minecraft again (instead of using his little linux box that I set up instead) and it's probably messed up something again. I'm on my phone, so I open up the ""run"" dialog and squint at it. see ""shutdown -r -t 3"" in there and hit enter.

I text my dad letting him know that it's rebooting. His response: ""you can do that from there?"" and a ""you'll need to show me how to do that so I don't have to bother you."" (Which would just be awesome, giving my parents access to the whole hypervisor account. riiiiiiiiiiiight.)

Anyways. I fall asleep from a combination of sickness and sleep deprivation. Wake up with a manditory bowel evacuation routine, check on the server. Still down. Hm.

Woke up this morning after a night of uncomfortable sleep and digestive system purging. Server is still down. This is when I realize that the last time I logged into the server was before I left for the school year, and I shut it down to do some hardware upgrades. It didn't read ""shutdown -r"" but ""shutdown -s""

Archeval,12,42,1ppzws,133,"Hey there TFTS, I have tale to tell and hope to take you all along for the ride.  
  

I work for an IT solutions company where basically we sign clients and service their network, phones, servers, desktops, and applications through management of vendors.  
  
So it was an another early morning in the tech cave, working with clients, resolving tickets when I get a call from &lt;small power company&gt; and for the sake of the story let’s just call this guy BU (Bad User).  

&gt;**ME:** &lt;company name&gt; this is Archeval, what can I help you with today?  
**BU:** Hey, I have been have some problems with my computer, USB slots don’t work, and my computer is reeealy slow when I start it up.  
**ME:** ok, (to me at least it sounds like driver crashed and burned for the USB controller and some cleanup that needs to be done, but I ask this) was there anything that happened recently before this started happening?  
**BU:** well the other day I came to my computer and it said “installing updates 5 out of 48 installed, please do not turn off power.” I shut it down because it looked like a virus and when I restarted my computer it came back up and I restarted it again and after that I have just been having problems.  
(Now from this point I have to resist my head reaching the floor by face-desking so hard that I break through the desk.)
**ME:** *clears throat* Ok BU, I am going to have to talk this over with my lead and see what plan of action we are going to take on this. (I already know at this point that we are going to have to take the laptop and bring it to our office so we can fix it best we can)  
**BU:** Alright but this laptop is very important and I take it with me to remote sites and I won’t be back for a while.  
**ME:** alright, I will make sure that we have something lined out to do fairly soon.  
After hanging up I bury my face into my hands and let out the obligatory Oh. My. God.  
I go and tell my lead about this and it’s a pretty small office area so everyone can hear what’s going on while I am telling him this, and I get the standard facepalm and they agree that we need the laptop here and the lead said he would take it over.  

He called BU and told him that we need the machine here and all I heard after that was an exasperated sigh as he said “alright we’ll find another way.” I asked what happened he said,  “BU refused to give us the laptop and that he needs it to do his work, so we are going to purchase a new laptop, set up what we can here and join it to their domain when it gets back.”  
“Welp looks like he is just going to have to deal with his problems then because we won’t be able to oversee a re-install remotely.” I shrugged and got a confirming nod from the lead.  
So time passes by about 2 weeks while the status on the new laptop says “In Transit”, and the client getting ever more impatient saying that he can’t get his work done in a timely manner. (that’s all his own fault but you know how it goes in IT.)  
  
So the day finally comes where we get the new laptop, we get everything we need installed relatively quickly except for Office which won’t accept the license key that they have except for the installer that is on a network share in their server where their only mode of connecting with the outside world is satellite……. Eeeeeeeeeew. 
So after a full day of transferring their installer we got office installed and sent it off to the client site with a sheet of paper that said “STOP! DO NOT POWER ON. PLUG INTO POWER AND CALL &lt;COMPANY NAME&gt;”.
So about another week later (they are only about 8 to 900 miles away it shouldn't take a whole week, oh well) they receive the laptop and there are 40GB of information that needs to be transferred from the old laptop to the new one…. Something nice to know earlier and another reason to have it in the office but it’s not the end of the world.  
  
Ok so we start transferring the data over and then the old laptop goes dark and the transfer stops. Turns out the machine blue screened and we lost about 4 hours of transfer time on it, but no data loss! 
So we try again… It goes down again, lost all network connectivity…. Because we have to not give up on it we try just one more time. Yet again the old laptop blue screened.
So now as far as I know what is going to happen is that the old laptop is going to be connected to an external hard drive and transferred through USB. 2.0 btw (seems like it would be slower to me, but I’ll go along with it).
Personally I think this person shouldn't use a computer ever, ever again.  
**TL;DR** I ran my hand into a fan, I don’t think it mangled it enough so I’ll run it through again and complain that my hand doesn’t work anymore.

shoelaceninja,46,51,1ppz1t,192,"I will start off with a brief background about myself.  I taught myself everything I needed to know to build my own computer in high school for gaming.  Since then, I've built a handful of systems for friends and acquaintances.  It's not something I can really say I'm too good at (budgeting and looking for deals) but I've built a good number of reliable machines and I've only had 1 unhappy customer who was a douche and kept plugging his monitor into the onboard card rather than the dedicated video card.

The other day I was put in contact with a woman who works for a local distributor of an out of state supplier (the industry might be too revealing, and it's not too relevant).  She wanted me to meet with her and build a new computer for their business.  Pretty much all it needed to do was run quickbooks and be able to send quickbooks reports to the supplier.  That seemed simple.  I offered to take a look at their current computer and see if there was anything I could do with it; I mean, I could just reinstall the OS and potentially save them hundreds of dollars, even if that meant less money for me.

Right off the bat she was against the idea.  She began describing to me how old the pc was.  ""It has vista.""  ""It's slow and full of stuff.""  ""The person who previously worked here messed it up before she left.""  Oh, well dang, sounds like you need some help then.

Today I met with her.  She began by entering sales receipts into quickbooks.  She wanted to show me her work process and show me the problems the computer was giving her.  This was my first warning sign, but it should have been my second (I was slowly beginning to understand why she didn't want to salvage their current computer).  She was claiming the computer was ""messed up and slow,"" but all of her problems were quickbooks related.  I knew this because I use quickbooks for my work regularly, and I observed her doing everything wrong.  I even threw in a comment about something she missed, and she kinda brushed it off.  I didn't want to be rude, so I left it there.  My next warning was when in addition to a new computer, she wanted me to ""make everything easy for her to do.""  I kinda didn't really take that one in until later.  I just assumed at first that she meant ""make it inherently easier by building us a better computer.""

So, she flat out didn't know how to use quickbooks, and she repeatedly told me that she was not a computer person.  Her at-home computer use amounts to minimal internet browsing and minimal emailing.........

I kept suggesting that it may be totally unnecessary to get a new computer.  I told her that it all seems quickbooks related.  She then told me that she was going to switch to quicken for the business, and asked me if I thought it would be any easier than quickbooks....  ""I honestly don't know anything about that ma'am.""  She responded with ""well I guess you're just gonna have to research it then huh?""

WHAT?  

Almost all of a sudden it became clear to me that the only qualification she had for this job was knowledge of the industry and its products, but was rendered nearly 100% incompetent because she can't use a computer in almost any capacity...  Not only that, but she was trying to lie to her boss and blame the problem on the computer.  So...... she was trying to get me to train her on how to do her job so that when the computer gets replaced it looks as if that was the solution.  Now, I know this is an opportunity for me to make some extra money in offering to train her, but I don't want to...  Not for someone who would try and pull this stunt...  

I don't know what to do.  I didn't make it obvious that I knew what was really going on.  When I left, I told her that I would quote her on a machine as well as recommend some laptops as alternatives (could save money, and their current system is a laptop) and get back to her monday.  I offered to email her the info and she quickly responded with ""have you not been listening? I don't know how to use computers.""

I honestly don't know how to approach this woman the next time I see her.  I'm more than willing to build her a pc, but I have never and am not willing to provide ELI5 computer training, especially to someone who is using me, lying to their boss, and making their boss spend money needlessly because of incompetence.

Idk man, I suck at telling stories.  But if anyone likes this, I'll definitely do a Pt. 2 (or more?) in the coming week(s).

&gt;For those who wish to tl;dr this - His ""client"" is evidence that you can lead stupid to knowledge, but you can't make them think.

EDIT:

I would like to thank everyone for their comments.  This is by far the most response I've ever gotten to a reddit post and I'm a little shocked to be honest.  

I've decided that the best course of action for myself personally is to refuse to do business with her in any capacity, though I will not be going over her head to her boss.  She is a friend of a family member and I would hate to cause any strains on relationships between them because I know that would end up causing me problems down the road with my family member.  

EDIT:

It also seems that the supplier portion of the business does not have its own website, and all avenues of communication end up at the local distributor.  So I can't even figure out how to get in contact with her boss.  She is also unsupervised at the moment.  I feel very sorry for this business.  Even with my limited knowledge on quickbooks, if I was thrown into her job today I would at least be capable of teaching myself to do what was needed by the end of the day, minus familiarity of products and the industry.

Sxooter,29,83,1ppma5,406,"This tale takes place WAY back in the 1980s. A time of 35Meg hard drives, 80186 processors and 256K of main memory.

I was in the Air Force and we had a Burroughs cluster system that had three 35 meg hard drives in it. These drives were notoriously unreliable and we had to replace one about every 3 or 4 months. We kept the current operating OS on one, and the user data on another, and backed up the OS and data to both the third drive and a tape drive.

Get in, and we start getting error messages that tell us the OS drive is hours, maybe days at most, from dying. Tell all the users they need to get off so we can replace that drive, as it could fail at any time. Everybody logs off. Except the tech writers. Go downstairs, tell them they need to log off as the system could go down at any time. They ask for just 30 more minutes. I tell them to keep saving their data, as the server could crash at any minute.

30 minutes goes by, still not logged off. They ask for 30 more and 30 more again. And again. It's now afternoon, and the error messages are getting more common. Go upstairs, grab the key on the front of the server, and turn it off.

Phone rings. ""What happened?!"" Well, the server went down. Technically true. Mainly I got tired of them just using the 30 more minutes excuse and wanted to get that drive replaced so everybody else, who had all logged off hours ago, could get their jobs done too.

""But I just lost hours worth of work!"" 

""Sorry but that's why I told you to save a lot, the server was getting unstable.""

Tech docs have a sad face now.

DkPhoenix,35,65,1ppb3s,320,"This happened long, long ago, in a call center far, far away.

The product in question was a file server marketed to small offices.  Basically, it was a chunk of plastic with a HDD, a stripped down mobo with an onboard NIC, and a minimal OS stored on a ROM chip.  It was manufactured by a company long out of business, and the parts were sourced from the lowest possible bidders.

*(cue ominous music here)*

Despite being assembled by howler monkeys using counterfeit parts that had been kept in a leaky U-Store-It shed for months, the only part that really had a problem was the power supply.  The Molex strip had, shall we say, a less than robust coating on it, therefore all of these units were eventually going to short out.  Every.  Single.  One.  Under the best of circumstances, the unit would give a little warning first.  Sometimes the first sign of trouble was when they caught fire.  This is a tale of the best circumstances.

If the coating hadn't flaked off too badly, the infernal boxes would get just enough power to flash an (undocumented, of course) error code, but not enough to spin the drive or access the ROM to administer the thing.  There was a chance that it could be resurrected long enough to get whatever data off the drive before the unlucky owner shipped it back for warranty repairs, got a refurb of equal quality in return, and got dinged $500 USD for ""data recovery"".  Each one of us in the shop had a different method.  The end result was the same, the wires would (hopefully) contact a slightly less degraded part of the posts on the Molex strip and (hopefully) stay up long enough to copy off their data and format the thing.  One guy had them smack the side of the server.  Another had them raise the server exactly 18"" above the desktop and drop it.  I had them open the case and jiggle the wires, because that made them feel all technical.  Another coworker had a more unusual remedy.

The coworker in question had spliced together a really long cord for his headset, and we always knew when he had a bad one on the line, because he'd pace.  Now, you should know, this guy had an exceptionally deep, melodious voice, and a heavy southern accent.  He also had one of our lab models on the desk next to him, so he could act out everything he was telling the caller.

""Do you have the Firebomb Server next to you now?  Good, goooood.  Is it on a flat surface?  excellent.  Now, what I want you to do, is to place your left hand on the table next to the Firebomb Server...""

*(He pauses, and places his left hand next to the lab model.)*

""Have you done that?  Good, goooood.  Now, I need to you reach deep inside yourself, and find that part that really wants to recover your data.  Can you do that for me, brother?  Good, goooood...""

*(All activity ceases.  People lean in to hear better.)*

""Now, raise your right hand above your head...""

*(He does this.)*

""...and bring it down upon the Firebomb Server, and say **HEEEE-UHL!**  Let me hear you say **HEEEE-UHL!**""

So take large insurance company A. They would receive a mountain of incoming post everyday. One department checks it doesn't contain nasties such as anthrax etc, another department opens the mail, another department puts the mail in batches and another department scans in the batches which get indexed into a computer system (which is where I come in).

I developed a new feature for agents so that not only can they now scan paper but they can also scan microfiche. 

The software went through the usual development, integration testing, UAT testing phase and was released.

The first morning of the release and somebody raises a ticket saying they can't scan in their batches this morning.

Upon investigation one guy had seen there was now a new option and even though he was scanning a great big pile of paper (ie a batch) he thought it would now be great if he chose the scan microfiche option.

I get a call from one of our SI about their client complaining about an average of 40% packet loss on one of their circuits, we go though the usual troubleshooting of checking the NTU for duplex mismatches and errors on the nics. We don't see any problems on our part of the link so I close the SI ticket saying no issue found, referred to SI.

A few days later we got the exact same call from the same SI with the exact same problem, so this time I asked the SI to look at the customers internal equipment. The SI assures us that the customer equipment is fine and he is going out to site in the next few days to confirm the problem.

So a few more days pass and we get his call when he is onsite.  He confirms that there is packet loss but its only 12% not the 40% the customer said.

Before I started to help him troubleshoot the issue I asked him for the ping results. So he eventually sends them though and I discover that the problem is that the packet size he is using for the pings is ridiculously high.

I am a student assistant for the ""introduction to programming"" class at my university.

dalgeek,22,33,1pocpu,168,"I roll into one of my consulting gigs around 10am one day and plug in my laptop, only to find that I get no network connectivity.  Odd, that drop worked yesterday.  Turn on the wireless and I can associate OK but can't get an IP address.  ""Hey, what's going on with the network?""  ""Oh, we had a switch go down this morning.""  *sigh*

I wander over to the main switch room and find two techs frantically trying to get a distribution switch online.  I find out that this all started with an outage at another site; some line cards failed in another switch, so they were trying to find working line cards to deploy in the field.  The process for this?  Grab line cards off the shelf, shove them into a *production chassis* and see if they work.

Well, on the second set of line cards the switch rebooted spontaneously, taking out most of the wireless in the building and 100+ wired clients.  The switch would boot to the point where you could log in then crash again.  We attempted to upgrade the firmware, hoping it was just a corrupted image, but no love.  The techs spend the next 30 minutes scrambling to put a new switch online and physically move network drops.

After the immediate crisis is over we start to work on troubleshooting the broken switch.  They pulled out all of the line cards to eliminate as many variables as possible, only leaving the supervisor; this didn't fix the problem, but while the chassis was mostly empty I decided to take a peek inside.  Using the Torch app on my phone I [spotted this](http://i.imgur.com/xl3gE86.jpg) within about 10 seconds.  To quote Adam Savage, ""Well there's yer problem"".

I ask where the line cards are that were being tested.  We look through the 2nd set of cards and [find this oddity](http://i.imgur.com/0MsOTA0.jpg) -- it doesn't look too bad, and would probably function OK, but does not match the damage on the inside of the switch chassis.  We go hunting for the other set of line cards that were tested -- bingo.  The backplane connector on one of those cards [looked like a gremlin was chewing on it](http://i.imgur.com/z95KvF1.jpg) and looked like an exact match for the damage inside the chassis.

Apparently the 3rd card in the 1st set was damaged during transport or storage.  When it was inserted into the chassis, it mangled the backplane connector.  The card didn't work (for obvious reasons) so it was removed and another card inserted -- this time the card was damaged and the backplane shorted out which damaged the supervisor module.  I checked another spare chassis and found that 2 slots on that chassis were damaged in the exact same location.

Final damage count:

* 2 x 6509-E switch chassis
* 2 x 6348 line cards
* 1 x SUP 720
* 3 hours of downtime for ~ 100 employees

When I mentioned that they should use a LAB SWITCH for testing sketchy hardware I was told ""Are you kidding?  That costs too much!""  Yeah, well how much does it cost to have all these people sitting around doing nothing for 3 hours?  Hopeless battle ..

PirateGloves,149,191,1po9jt,835,"So this story is from about two years ago. I had been working doing hardware support for a large company for only a few months, getting the hang of everything. Mostly my role was swapping HDDs from faulty laptops into working laptops, or replacing faulty HDDs in working laptops. Nothing terribly cerebral, but enough to keep me busy.

Our fleet at the time consisted of Lenovo R400s with the oh-so-glorious Accidental Damage Warranty. This story is about the single greatest Accidental Damage Warranty claim I have had the privilege to be a part of.

So back to me, bright eyed and chipper young techie looking forward to all the wonderful opportunities afforded by working in a large corporation (HA! Sorry, that's another story), working hard, fixing laptops, and closing tickets, when a ticket arrives in my queue from the helpdesk ominously titled ""Laptop Damage"". Detailed notes only said that the customer (not allowed to call them users, official vocab guidelines) had damaged their laptop over the weekend and needed a replacement.

No worries, thinks I, Lenovo laptop, accidental damage, swap HDD and send damaged machine to Lenovo for repair. Piece of cake. I call the customer to arrange for them to come to the workroom and they're already skirting around the cause and extent of the damage, saying they'll be in as soon as possible. Well, not 5 minutes go by and she's at my door, laptop bag over her shoulder, and a thoroughly harried expression on her face.

Now, accidental damage isn't uncommon. Usually it's just been knocked off a table or had a glass of water tipped on it.

No.

Nothing could have prepared me for what i saw when I pulled the laptop from the bag. To this day I regret not taking photos.

The right hand side of the laptop base was demolished. Keyboard shattered, optical drive hanging out, shards of plastic everywhere. The frame though... it was impressive. It's difficult to describe but the frame had been bent down so the side profile of the laptop was semi-circular. Fascinatingly enough, the screen was intact.

I stared at this thing on my desk for a few moments just taking it in, then for a few moments more considering whether or not I should even ask. Curiosity got the better of me and I just said ""This is impressive, what happened?""

Her response came quickly and with some irritation.

""I was out visiting my parents at the farm and the kids were playing with my laptop then a horse stepped on it...""

The sentence rang in my ears... *a horse stepped on it.*

What possible chain of events could take place for a horse to step on an open laptop?

At this point, I decided it was better that I didn't know, informed the user I would get them a replacement laptop. I guessed from the extent of the damage that even if the HDD wasn't completely destroyed it was at least on deaths door, so I opted to image a new laptop and transfer the data, which was the right call as the HDD died half way through the data transfer.

I think the best part was when I called Lenovo to book it in for repair. The guy on the line asked what was damaged so I said ""Base cover, chassis, optical drive, keyboard, palmrest, top bezel, HDD, and mainboard""

He was silent for a moment and finally said, ""What happened?""

""A horse stepped on it.""

Another moments silence then an uproar of laughter as the guy completely lost all sense of decorum when faced with the absurdity of it.

""That's the best one I've ever heard!"" he said after the laughter died down.

True to their warranty, Lenovo repaired (not replaced) the laptop and sent it back to us.

In the middle of winter, during a heavy snow storm, a satellite dish north of the Mason-Dixon line would fill up with snow thereby losing the data signal.

One cold and stormy night the tech-center's phone rings. The customer says they're not receiving any data and the tech tells them they need to clean off the dish.

Our policy at the time was that since we owned and delivered the data, we would provide end-to-end 24-hour service. However, extenuating circumstances such as long distances during inclement weather could warrant leaving the responsbility of cleaning snow from the dish to the customer.

This was that cold and stormy night when consequences would never be the same.

The tech, ""George"", insisted that the customer clean off the dish because he was not going to risk life and limb traveling 90 miles in the worst snow storm of recent memory to wipe his snow.

The customer relented. The customer called back 20 minutes later.

This is what George told me he said when he met with international corporate management and the union reps:
""He told me he took a broom out to the roof and swept all the snow off the dish, but he still wasn't receiving. When I arrived at the customer's facility at two in the morning, there were no foot prints in the snow.""

**ME:** How many emails are you missing?

**USER** I don't know... I know there where at least two people who I know of that emailed me and I didn't receive their messages.  There are probably more!  People need to reach me and they can't!!

**ME:**  OK, do you know if either of these people received a bounce back message or an error after they sent you a message?

**USER**  One of them did , I think.

**ME:**  I'm going to need from you to get in contact with that user and have them forward me that error message.  Also, I'm going to need the email addresses for both the people as well.

**USER**  I'll try.  Can you please look at the server in the meantime?  I'm missing important emails and if this continues I don't what I'll do!!  People need to be able to reach me!

Also, I will be reaching out to the first email address to ask them for their bounced back message for troubleshooting... User believes that she shouldn't have to do it so I'll let you know when I get a response.

I kindly suggest that their maintenance department should install an *adhesive* latch and lock on the paper tray. I very specifically said *adhesive*.

Second call: “Our printer is broken.”  When I come onsite, I notice that they have indeed secured the paper drawers with a latch.  However, the latch is secured with eight sheet metal screws, right into the side of the printer.  Dell replaces this one too.  Maintenance was unsure why they were being reprimanded for installing a latch, as requested.  I had to explain to two grown men that there are mechanical bits inside a printer, and that they will not work when screws are drilled into them. “Oh, you meant one of those sticky latches”.

Going back a bit, there had been some conflict over monitor arms.  They aren't rocket science, so I've always built/mounted arms as part of installing monitors.  Management decided arms should be a furniture job, until I had another internal job with two dual arms, and the assembler put the arms on upside down, slowing the job down a day (I'm hourly and was only allowed so much time to do the work - I fixed one arm, let the head of furniture know his guy hosed the arms the other needed to be fixed.)

So, last week I get last minute word that I need to take down and move 2 PCs and monitors on arms.  No problem.  Next day, I get last minute word the new furniture is done and I need to move three users to the new desks.  Go upstairs, get two moved without much hassle.  The third desk, which is used by someone who mostly works from home, has no exposed outlets.  There's a power strip (not a surge protector or UPS) plugged into an outlet I can't see behind a 200lb cabinet.  There's also an outlet on the other side of the panel, but I don't have a wrecking bar to lift the panel up to get the plug under it.  I explain to the head of the furniture division I can't hook that PC up until the UPS can be plugged in.  Commence a 20-minute argument over where the UPS and tower will go, as the furniture has no concession for not having the 'ugly' PC and UPS exposed.  I tell her I could care less where she wants it, I just need the UPS plugged in, and she can let me know where the PC should go. 

I also let her know I need the lateral file out a foot from the wall so I can hide another UPS behind it. She says that won't work, as it's too far out.  But it can't be next to it, either, as it's also ugly, what with the cords sprouting out the top and all.

The monitor also looks stupid, as the grommets are to the far sides of the desk, meaning it has to be at full stretch to get it the monitor to the center of the desk.  I email furniture director saying it will need a grommet drilled in the center, and the user will not be able to come in until it's done, as her PC is hooked up in the 'junk cube' so she can still remote into it, but there isn't even room for a chair in that cube.

Go upstairs today, UPS still not plugged in, hole for monitor arm not drilled, nothing has changed for 3 days.  Ask installer about it, he says he got into an argument with the director of furniture and walked away.

TL;DR: you would think, if you get $20k worth of furniture, that it might have some small consideration that PCs will be used and you might need some way of hiding equipment/cables/etc.  Instead, have furniture director piss off everyone involved and fail to make any decisions.",Furniture vs IT,138
Cagny,73,16,1plf3o,93,"I used to work on a computer support call-line for a bank. I've received about 50 calls related to some problem caused by space heaters but this was the worst. 

I received the call in the afternoon on Friday, the worst time for any bank. A frantic teller sounded desperate and I could hear yelling in the background while it sounded like at least five battery back ups blaring alarms. I asked what happened. The teller said, ""Nothing. Well, I just unplugged the heater."" 

I asked was the heater on when she unplugged it. ""Yes."" Was it in the battery back-up? ""Yes."" How many other battery back-ups are going off? ""The whole teller line."" 

Usually not the end of the world. Someone just has to go and trip the breaker. However, the bank manager runs up to the phone and yells the breaker box is locked. 

So.. we shut down the entire teller line on Friday and call in someone who may know something about a key. The teller line got shut down for about 3 hours. Funny thing is that the box wasn't even locked. The manager thought it was because it had a strange handle on it. 

After gruesome years of me complaining and seeing about 30 heaters being sent out to users, it seems that the company no longer is going to let users have them. I once was doing inventory and found an office locked for the day with a space heater on full blast in the dead of summer. Seriously. I even think once a space heater caused a surge and fried a PC's mobo.

Neue_Ziel,11,13,1pl7kp,78,"Not much of an IT thing, but as the network admin for the reactor network on an aircraft carrier, I was also given the job of maintaining the reactor plant radio system, because that makes sense somehow. It was probably 20 year old tech modified so that each handheld's power was below a certain threshold, lest the signal cause the nuclear instruments to peg high and have us scram or something. It was only able to be used in certain spaces wired with repeaters and nowhere else. 

Enter the ship's Fire Marshall. He thought that since it was a reactor radio, it should be superpowered and allow him access to the entire ship. Because nuclear power makes everything awesome! Like my 4 page documentation on verifying tape backups. Good times...

FM: Petty Officer Neue_Ziel, why aren't these radios working like my regular topside radios? I use my topside radio in the plant and it works just fine, but your radios don't work for shit anywhere else.


NZ: Sir, one, the reactor radios only work in the plant spaces and are modified to emit a lower power signal than your topside radio, to prevent interfering with the sensitive electronics controlling the reactor, and two, did you say you were using the topside radio in the plant?


The Reactor Officer was nearby, and heard the whole exchange. The ship's Fire Marshall was given a good tongue lashing on proper radio use.

Gambatte,29,9,1pksfh,69,"This just happened, and I'm still shaking out the last of what I assume is righteous fury.

A large part of my current role revolves around support for the field technicians for the company's proprietary unit. This includes liaising with the developers about new firmware features, ensuring the testing is done on new features and rolling it out. There's even a (nearly) full blown test environment to do all of this in.

The CEO recently put on his sales hat and while rubbing shoulders with a major client, promised new features that don't currently exist but theoretically could. I could smell trouble on this one, but I did as I was bid.

So the new firmware was delivered for testing this morning, and I happened to mention this in passing to the CEO, because I knew he was all fired up about fulfilling the promises he shouldn't have made.

&gt; CEO: Oh good! Put it on the prod server so I can load it to my office unit and test it ASAP.

&gt; ME: Um... That's not procedure...

&gt; CEO: I want to test it immediately - get it done!

I caved, like I had a spine made of rubber. Yes, I folded faster than Superman on laundry day. So I'm busy uploading the new firmware to the production server and making the required changes in the database so it points to the right file, when I get a call from a technician on one of the sites that the new firmware is being developed for.

As it turns out, the unit was not communicating with the server at that time, which was odd, but not why the technician was on site - he was doing some testing on another device that connected to ours. Nonetheless, I roped him in to some quick tests to see if we could get it communicating again (which, incidentally, did not help. It restored of it's own accord about half an hour after the tech left the site).

While I'm doing this, I receive an alert that the primary server (where I'm uploading the untested firmware) is running slowly. I jump in there and check Perfmon, to see DQL is through the roof. I identify a SQL query that's taking in excess of 12 minutes to complete, on a 10 minute recurring schedule; ensure it's not vital and disable it. Server performance comes back to normal, and I flag that job for further investigation. While still on line with the tech, running communications troubleshooting steps.

About this time, the CEO leans into the cubicle and says:

&gt; CEO: What are you doing? Why isn't that firmware online yet! You're holding me up!

*wutface.jpg*

&gt; CEO: The tech is on site! He's waiting for it right now!

So about now, my hands are pretty much shaking with rage. About this time, the tech has reached the end of troubleshooting without having been able to make any improvements, so he ends the call to go do the actual job he went there for.

Being released from the phone call, I can now spell out exactly what is wrong with what the CEO just said.

&gt; ME: Right! Number one, the tech on site is NOT there to set up the (new firmware features), he's there for (unrelated matter).

&gt; ME: TWO, that unit isn't even communicating right now, so even if you wanted to upload that firmware remotely, YOU CAN'T.

&gt; ME: THREE, I was on a PHONE CALL. But despite that, I am STILL UPLOADING THE FIRMWARE RIGHT NOW.

CEO, thoroughly chastened, retreats.

About 10 minutes later, I'm happy that the firmware has been uploaded, it's been passed to all servers, the firmware file location change in the DB has been applied and that change has also replicated through all servers, so I check on the CEO. Seeing that he is on a phone call, I start the process of uploading the new firmware to the unit in his office and send him an email letting him know that:

A) the firmware is now on the production servers, and

B) it is currently streaming to the unit in his office.

About half an hour after the email:

&gt; CEO: Is that firmware on the server yet?

&gt; ME: *(le sigh)* Yes, I sent you an email about it because you were on a phone call. I've already uploaded it to the unit in your office.

&gt; CEO: Oh, okay.

I calmed down a bit after that...

...until right now, when I checked on activity for that unit. Three hours later, after I WAS HOLDING HIM UP, and he hasn't done any testing on it *AT ALL*.

nerobro,5,15,1pkatj,60,"Level 1 handed up a call to me.  The customers VPN isn't working.  While they do have access (now) to our core routing equipment, they're unable to determine if a customer has a VPN.  

Fine.  Ok.  Whatever.  

I'm familiar with the customer they're sending my way, and I know they DO have a VPN.  The Level 1 tech tells the Customer that Nerobro will be calling them back, and i proceed to go to work.  

Poking and prodding at their network config, I find that while all three sites are set up to work with the VPN, the router we installed at one site doesn't have the proper routes to pass the VPN.  It's been that way for a while.  A long while.  Probably months.  At least since we replaced the router out there.  

I wonder how long this has been a problem.  But I fix the issue anyway, and pray the customers firewall is set to accept traffic for their VPN IP space.  

Then I call the customer back, and the frustration just bleeds through the phone.  You could have mopped off my desk.  

The actual story isn't ""the VPN broke.""  Which I fixed.  The problem the customer was running into was ""my application server died.  I rebuilt it, now we can't reach it from the other sites.""  Which is a whole other story.  I tell him that I fixed the vpn, but I don't think that's the source of his problem, and that he should contact the person who manages their network.  He completely bypassed that suggestion.

I tell the customer that I did find that the VPN was broken, and I repaired it.  ""But we're paying you for it, and it's not working now.  You need to fix it.""  

But, I HAD fixed it.  And that's where things really turned downhill.  The customer didn't actually know their VPN wasn't working.  They just assumed it was, and knew it was on their bill.  When the VPN they were using stopped working, they assumed it was us.  

The customer has firewalls at each site, that most likely provided their VPN connectivity.  Outside of the pseudo MPLS VPN we were providing them.  The idea of routing separate subnets through the same interface, completely blew this guys mind.  

He ""just wants to know how to make the vpn work.""  As an aside, why is it always ""just want to know X"" turns out to be ""I just want to know how to make the sorcerers stone, can't you tell me?"" instead of ""can't you just tell me how to make it red?""  

I e-mailed the guy the relevant network information for each site.  Routed subnets, IPs to connect to our routers, etc.  I called him back.. and he doesn't know what a /24 is.  He read the /24's as 0 through 24.  

I had to explain what CIDR was.  I had to explain how routing worked.  I had to explain why there were separate public networks, and private networks at each site.  I had to explain that his firewalls did the routing at two sites, and we did the routing at the third site.  (Don't ask me how they weaseled us into doing that..)

All through this he kept harping back to ""We're paying you for a VPN.  How come it was broken?""  and ""Why were you charging us for it if it wasn't working.""  We don't monitor customer VPNs, we depend on customers to report problems on them.  They weren't using the VPN, so there was no problem.  

And then the customer demanded to know how to make this all work.  Which I can explain in general terms, but in specific can't tell him. That requires knowing the OS's of each firewall.  And we're not in the business of configuring peoples firewalls for them.  

The most frustrating part, is that this is all a giant red herring.  His network was working fine before he rebuilt his application server.  And that means it was working WITHOUT the VPN.  

In the end, I told him that in the interest of getting this fixed, he needs to talk to the person who built their network.  As going down the path we were on means rebuilding his network to use our VPN instead of the configuration that they were using.  

I haven't heard back.  Hopefully he got it fixed.","The Enemies Within: Fix my VPN: What's 0/24? And we're paying you, so it's your fault. Episode 44.",75
Zehnpae,228,387,1pk90e,1441,"One thing many people don’t realize is just how layered and interbred internet services can be when it comes to selling and reselling.  

One of my many illustrious career paths was a network operations position for a managed services company.  Our clients were typically technical clients in and of themselves, usually these hosts and resellers for small/medium businesses.  

Over time due to acquirements, trades and resales that I was the NOC admin (IE: Tech support guy) for one company we’ll call “Carpenters Bargain Internet” who rebought some of its services from another company called “Jimmy’s Premium Networks” who we also happened to be the NOC for.  And then one day we were hired on as the NOC for “Big Lawyers on Wallstreet office” who happened to be getting their internet from….Carpenters Bargain Internet.

This would have been fine until one day the moons aligned and I get a call from Big Laywers on Wallstreet because their internet wass down.  Now as part of my job description I had to call Big Lawyers ISP, who was again Carpenters Bargain Internet…who was me.  So I did the only logical thing.

I talked to myself. 

I asked myself why the internet was down.  I told myself that we weren’t certain yet but we’d investigate.  Our technicians would looking into it and then get back to them.

Of course ‘our techicians’ was me.  And by looking into it I meant that I’d ask myself why my services weren’t working for my client.  Now, as a technician for Big Carpenters Internet it was my duty to look into the problem.  I checked into who we got our lines from for Big Lawyers on Wallstreet and wouldn’t you know it, we got them from Jimmy’s Premium Networks.  I did the only sane thing anybody would do.  I sent an email to Jimmy’s Premium Networks asking why the internet wasn’t working.

I waited about 20 seconds for the email to come to myself and then explained to myself that I was just made aware of the issue and would get back to myself once I knew more.  I then called myself at Big Lawyers on Wallstreet to tell myself that we were investigating and would email myself when I got an update.  I then contacted the owner of Big Lawyers on Wallstreet and told him that I didn’t have an update yet but expected one soon.

I had to keep doing this for about 3 days, keeping track of every ‘imaginary’ phone call and leaving an email trail between different mailboxes that I all monitored.  The most bizarre was when Big Lawyers asked me to demand an explanation for the outage.  Nothing quite like writing yourself a stern email and informing your boss that you’re very disappointed in your own lack of communication with yourself.

In the end it turned out some crazy farmer in Virginia cut through a fiber line by accident but then buried the line back up and wouldn’t let the authorities on his property to fix it.

GreatMontgomeryScott,28,25,1pk68t,125,"Hi TFTS, long time lurker/commenter, first time poster.  Thought I'd contribute a few of my better stories.  Here's one about how I learned a valuable lesson when I was still naive, and first starting my career.

When I was first starting in IT, I worked desktop support for a small law firm.  It was a pretty good gig, but lawyers can be difficult users.  One particular lawyer was very high strung, and the kind of person who ALWAYS had lots of VERY IMPORTANT things to do, and never had any time for the tech support they needed.  I'm sure you've encountered the type.  We'll call her VIL.(Very Important Lawyer)

One fine morning, my phone rings.

VIL: MY KEYBOARD HAS STOPPED WORKING AND I HAVE A CONFERENCE CALL IN 10 MINUTES!

ME: No problem VIL.  Did you spill something in it, or did it just stop working?

I wanted to get some basic information, and also reassure her.  I suspected that maybe she'd kicked the PS/2 plug out.

VIL: No, I didn't spill anything, it just stopped working.  PLEASE HURRY!  I HAVE A CONFERENCE CALL!
Me: OK, I'll grab a spare keyboard, and be there in 2 minutes.(It wasn't a very large office)

So true to my word, I grab a new keyboard, and head to her office.  When I get there, she is sitting on the far side of her desk, and dialing into the conference call.  I sit down at her computer, and hit a few keys to confirm it's not working.  Sure enough, none of the keys work, and I can't get the Caps or Num Lock.  I crawl under the desk, and see that the cable is seated properly.  Oh well, I think, it's really a dead keyboard.  I disconnect it, and proceed to unpack the new one, getting the hairy eyeball from VIL the entire time.  

I then pick up the old keyboard, and turned to put it in her trash can.  It's at this point that **well over 16 oz. of coffee** came spilling out of the keyboard, mostly all over my pants.  I stood there dumbfounded for a moment, and VIL became very engrossed in her conference call.  I probably poured another 8 oz. or so into the trashcan.

I plugged in the new keyboard, restarted the desktop, and left without another word to her.  My boss reimbursed my dry cleaning bill the next day, and I never trusted what a users said ever again.

I feel like I should share more of this story rather than just this one bit. 

Aside from asking if the dash should be upper case or lower case (by which he was referring to the underscore as the ""uppercase"" because it is above the dash on the key), this gentleman was a  [joy](http://imgur.com/9m3lAmB) to work with. 

He was having issues with a product key he received. I verified he was using the correct key, after some prodding of course. I had to prod because he was like talking to William Shatner, but he would forget to start talking again.

Ok, so he has the correct key. When I ask him to put it in he says he will call back. Fine his choice. I think its over, he had different plans. Mr. Shatner asks me about his audio, and asks where to plug his speaker in. Not something we support here at helpful ISP, but I figure why not. I soon found out why not. I get him to plug to color coded connector into to color coded jack. 

Mr. Shatner tells me its still not working. I try to get him to look at the system tray for the audio icon. Up to this point I really hadn't focused on the pc much. He lets me in on a little secret. The PC is off. I convince Mr. Shatner to turn it on. 

Now this is where it gets a bit more interesting. The PC is taking longer than what may be considered normal to boot, more than 5 minutes. I start probing deeper, big mistake. He tells me that the computer had been running fine *""until I talked to you people this morning.""* The software he downloaded from us is not even fully installed yet. Play it off, or rather ignore it, and move on. 

The computer boots, and loads windows along with most of the start up programs. Mr. Shatner is still complaining about no sound. I spend a good 5 minutes trying to convince him that he has to play something with sound before there will be sound. He goes about trying to open something, he won't finish the sentence to tell me what. Most of the conversation sounded like this:

Me: What do you see on your screen?

Mr. Shatner: I...uhhhhhhhhh.....well..............................

After more fumbling and failing, he tells me that the PC is 12 years old, he has never had any flavor of AV, has never de-fragmented the hard drive, has never removed any temporary files, or ever had anyone do a clean up for him.

I was impressed it was running at all. I sent him to his friendly local pc repair shop to try and revive the dinosaur he was working with.

TollhouseFrank,17,55,1pjw41,230,"Another magical tale from my job at the now closed dial-up company
*****

As anyone who has ever worked for any company that deals with money in any capacity will tell you - fraud happens more often than you think and it sucks to deal with.  However, being a small company and the small customer base (the state of WV and a few from across the border in Eastern Kentucky and Western Virginia around the Bluefield Area), even we had our fair share of it.


It usually was people signing up for the 'free month' offer with a fake credit card number - we didn't run them till 2nd month and didn't find out until then - and then signed up again and again.  When I first started there, the rule was ""3 strikes and you are out.""  You had to pay with a legit card or bring us cash personally or you had no service after fraud attempt 3.  After my first year, it got so bad in a certain area of WV (the coal-fields back when Meth started cropping up as the major issue), that we reduced it to 1 'attempt'.  The average customer (all but a handful of the cleverer shysters) always got caught because they never changed their phone number or Billing Name.


Cue the **Professional Fraudster**, aka PF.  This person was slick.  They had an -in- with their local phone company CO and were able to swap phone numbers when they wanted.  They were very slick about never giving the same information, and even masked their voice or would use family members to help with their scam.  While we heavily suspected them, we could never fully nail them, which grated on us severely as we could never get the *proof* we needed to deny them service.  This continued from the time I started till nearly the end of my 2nd year, when their local CO was bought out by National Telco that no longer serves this state.  With that done, it got a lot easier to detect them, though it took us another 3 months before we finally were able to lock down and nail all of their tricks.

**Call 1**

I had gone through the usual account setup procedure, and the alarm bells were ringing in my head.  I compared information, and confirmed it was the fraudster (they finally goofed and gave matching info from a previous attempt).  Since I knew they couldn't change the phone number the next day, I had them nailed cold.  I asked them to call back the next day as the sign-up system was 'down for monthly maintenance at the moment'.
*****
**Call 2**

Next day comes.  They call back in, same number as the day before, different info again.  This time, I get to play hardball.

**Me:**  Sir, I can't create an account until you pay us for the nearly 2 years of service you have gotten for free by defrauding us.  I am being nice, but if you don't pay up, we'll have to turn you over not only to collections, but to the police for fraud charges.

**PF:**  I'm innocent!  I'm a new customer!  I just moved here!  

**Me:**  Sir, you have the same phone number as yesterday and I caught you redhanded yesterday, and gave you a day to come clean.  You lied again.  If you pay for your 2 years of service, I will gladly sign you up.  Heck, I will stick my neck out and give you a half-off discount (which back then, would have been about $90 for a year of service, instead of $180 for 2 years, at the bulk fee).  

**PF:**  *gets mad* This is highway robbery!  Give me your supervisor!  This is unmitigated fraud!  How dare you accuse me of lying?  How dare you!

**Me:**  *grins*  Yes sir.  Supervisor coming right up.

*passes call off to supervisor*, who is a lot nastier with the customer, and after the call is over, contacts a few agencies that deal with fraud, as well as his phone company to report his repeated fraud attempts to get them to block him from calling us.
*****
**Call 3**

A week later, I get a call from a number I don't recognize.  However, my inner alarm bells are going off from the start.  After some asking, I confirm who PF is.  Then the kicker!  He admits, over the phone after I ask about the weird noise issues I'm hearing on the line, to splicing into his neighbor's phoneline for service since his was cut off for fraud allegations.  Since this call was recorded, I just grin, and say: ""So, tampering with the phone lines and trying to setup another fake account for free internet again is NOT fraud?  Have a nice day!""  *click* I hang up, and get my boss to pull the call from the database and we hand it over to his local sheriff's department.

ITOverlord,23,31,1pjtbw,142,"So first time posting here, but for some background: I work from home, I am fairly high up on my company hierarchy and I'm coded as management. I work directly for corporate, and at this point in my career I'm 2 steps from being able to never advance again. That said, I manage multiple small groups of employees, a few supervisors, and oversee action plans and company changes typically get tested in my little group. Despite all of this, I started ground floor... as a technician, fixing computers in the trenches just like everyone else*(this is important, since a lot  of management in my company... is management now, because they were management before. As in,  they managed at X name retail store, sooo management experience). 

Now on a fairly recent fine day in the tech support world, I get an escalation filed DIRECTLY to me. This is strange, because normally it goes in a queue, which we have a specialized team to deal with. Those guys have pseudo management abilities in that they can approve up to X dollar amount in the clients favor (free services, service redos etc.). 

So I shrug, mentally prep myself because this normally only happens when a client is kicking and screaming, and pick up the phone. 

Me:""Hello this is ITOverlord, how can I assist you today?"" 

Her: ""IS THIS A SUPERVISOR"" 

Me: ""Yes ma'am, yes it is.""

Her: ""I WANT MY COMPUTER FIXED....FOR FREE""

Me: ""Alright I can hopefully assist with that and can understand your frustration, why don't you calm down and let me know what's going on so I can work with you.""

Her: ""Ok...*insert fairly typical story*""

Essentially, to cut out about 45 minutes of life story and 5 minutes of actual problem, I was told that she took her computer in for a windows upgrade to one of our stand alone physical locations. After getting it back, everything was gone and nothing was working (sounds pretty typical for a windows upgrade so it didn't ring any bells.)

Come to find out, she actually took it in AFTER she had upgraded it herself, to figure out why it broke after going from windows 7 to windows 8. Why she upgraded it herself... I still don't know, she has a very expensive service plan with us that includes free shadow copys and full data backups and transfers... but I digress. 

I get her connected with a technician remotely only to find out that she has a lot of hardware issues, so while I'm fielding and peeling the client away from the tech so he can work, I shoot him a quick thing telling him to run an SFC scan in case she messed something up in the upgrade that it would catch, and to manually check the drivers... (you know... open device manager). 

Well, I get the client content and happy, the tech is working all is good... but no, not going to last. 5 hours later another angry call about why it's been 5 hours and absolutely nothing is fixed... This is getting long so I'm going to cut... a lot of employee reaming, client yelling, and jump to the good part. I personally connect to the computer. I check his notes... and notice he did nothing I said to. He ran combofix... System Updater (a tool we use that auto reboots and logs in to continue running updates), Defrag, Temp file clean... miraculously everything BUT what I told him to. I start SFC... 10 minutes later, boom SFC found errors that couldn't be repaired. Check device manager? Boom a glorious wall of yellow warning signs on unrecognized devices. It took me about 30 minutes to walk the client through re-doing the win8 upgrade properly, and then another 30 or so to get her drives installed... but lo and behold, an hour later perfectly working computer. 

Apparently the employee told his supervisor (who is under me...) that he didn't think I knew what I was talking about, so he did what he thought REALLY needed to be done...

TL;DR: Angry client phones in and gets sent straight to manager (me). Client messed up a windows 8 upgrade from 7, needs help. Tell employee A exactly what needs to be done to fix it, and instead of doing that, ignored me because 'I'm just a manager and don't know a thing about actually working on computer'. 5 hours later, I take over personally, and fix it in the next hour doing exactly what I said...",Listen to your superiors...,173

my big problem is i don't know how to write up the ticket in a nice way.

go onsite to set up some port forwards and test remote connection to a piece of equipement.  not sure why it was complicated enough to have to go onsite.

and, they have a Uverse modem.

plugged into which is the sonic wall, the equipment i'm dealing with, and a phone system.

the password is, of course, printed on the modem.  so i log in and look.  business line.  static ip through ppoe.

but they have a small public subnet attached to it.

it's not working.

god bless AT&amp;T.

the soul who programmed the modem didn't turn off the firewall/nat.

so the public subnet is not doing anything. at all.

i think to myself, 1) god bless AT&amp;T. 2) if i fix this, it will probably break the sonicwall and also suddenly make their phone system public.

so i ask again, who manages the sonic wall.  i had asked when i arrived and was met with blank stares.

it turns out, the company who manages every fucking thing about their network, pc's, software, etc, who's logo is on the god damned terminals they are actively using manages the sonic wall.

so i call them.

long of the short: they tell me to put the equipment behind the sonicwall and they'll port forward it.

ok, cool.  someone else's problem is the best kind of problem.

i wait a bit, test the port forward, its not working.

call back.

actually get to speak to the ""sonicwall guy"".

we confer, and he vpn's in to the site because he can't access the sonicwall.

he logs into the Uverse modem.

he configures the sonicwall as the DMZ.  elegant, no?

Was connecting some VIPs to a guest wireless network today at work. 2 Macs, 1 PC. The first Mac I saw wouldn't auto-redirect to the guest wireless page. Uh oh...

Luckily the people who ran this small event also provided the direct link on their connecting-to-the-network guide, otherwise I would have been scrambling myself to find it. Direct link worked for first user.

I thought it might have been just a Mac issue but when I went to the PC I started to experience the same issue. The PC user said, ""Let's restart, restarting usually fixes it."" You were trained well, sir, but not well enough. Regardless, I let him do so since while he waited I could just go help the other Mac user where I saw the same issue with the same fix.

Luckily his computer wasn't a Pentium slush-box because a minute later he got back into Windows and tried the same thing. Well look at that, it doesn't work. After he got regged, I attempted to reboot the wireless instead of the whole computer

One evening I get the senior tech from tv/internet begging me to take a look at a call they have received over there who drive them crazy.

The customer claim that his TV is beeping every time he receives an email. The senior tech did several test sending him email and can hear the beep through the phone confirming what the customer says. The customer's computer being at the other end of the house it cannot be an 'hearing issue'.

I take the call and decide to do the test myself, sending an email to the customer and promptly realize whats going on when I hear the beep.

As I said, I was also covering the cell phone services and I instantly identified the beep as the sound that the Samsung A series were doing when receiving an SMS/email.

I explain the situation to the customer who reply that he does not own a cell phone (4-5 years ago). I still ask him to look around his TV for one and he does indeed find one under the TV stand.

Turns it was his girlfriend's who probably dropped it there. 

Extra bit: Customer does not understand how come her cell phone receives his email.

**X:** Sure.  

So I take a look.  Some seriously old brick wall &amp; steam radiators type action on the go here.  There are four offices in a row down the hallway, lo and behold, the furthest office has a network drop, with the ethernet cable running from it back through the other three offices along the baseboard, then up the stairs into oblivion*.

**X:** Well, that last office is good to go, there's a live network jack there already.  The others are going to need new network drops.

That way madness lies, doubly so given the complete lack of slack on the line.

MysticBlackmoon,7,30,1pgzl1,82,"&gt;Another slow morning. As with every day, my comrades and I are prepared for war, swords and shields gleaming in the sunlight of the dawn, but few challengers are forthcoming-- a singularly unusual occurrence. In the calm before the storm, my mind drifts back to the day before, and I remember a particular individual, a mercenary, who presents a thorny difficulty that would not be insurmountable if my brothers in arms were properly trained to combat it; I decide to re-engage him on the field of battle once more, but in my own self-interest, I prepare myself in advance.

*(It's a slow morning, and for whatever reason, I haven't taken a call in at least 40 minutes. Since I don't have anything better to do but dick around on reddit, I remember I have a suspended ticket, and I figure I might as well kill some time by calling that guy back. He's an external third-party user, which we've only just started supporting, and his account is locked. Locked accounts aren't unusual in themselves, but because our third-party users are stored in a different active directory than our internal guys, and the process for helping them is brand-new, most of our agents have some trouble dealing with that. Knowing what a pain it is to get into the TPA AD, I figure I'll just load up the tools before giving him a ring.)*

&gt;As I shore up, preparing my mighty blade, a call rings out on the wind. ""I have come to seek my foe-- which of you is foolish enough to meet me in his stead?"" With some surprise, I go to see the source of the commotion, and find the very mercenary I was preparing to re-engage. I had expected to fight him on my terms, but he came forth and found me instead. He would be bringing the fight to me this time.

*(While I'm loading up active directory and everything, I'm interrupted by a call coming through. Kind of a pain, I figure, but I'll help this guy first... then he gives me his ticket number, and I find it's the exact same guy I was just about to call back. Somehow, he managed to call through our support menu, and bypass a half-dozen other agents in the queue to get me by pure chance, barely a minute before I was about to call him myself. What are the odds of that?)*

&gt;""I have been expecting you, though perhaps not so soon,"" I say to him, hoisting my weapon before me. ""Prove to me, though, that you truly are the foe I seek, and not some base impersonator!""

&gt;He held aloft his banner, and I knew it was truly he. Despite the odds, he had found me here, amongst everyone else. He bellowed to me, ""Perhaps this time you are prepared for me!""

&gt;""Indeed I am.""

&gt;With an almost imperceptible movement of my steel, the enemy was felled. It had happened so fast, he scarcely believed it-- never before had he seen a warrior move with such speed. I thanked him for saving me the trouble of venturing out to find him, and continued about my own business.

*(I verified his security question, and before he even explained his problem, I unlocked his account. He was shocked, since this was his third call and he wasn't expecting it to be that fast. I thanked him for calling me first and wished him a nice day.)*

nerobro,32,11,1pgzef,85,"**TL;DR:** No, it's not our network.  Dispatch people, now!  *But.. it was your network*

I really try to avoid tales that are of the user failure variety.  They're not fair, and they're old hat.  But, this week I have two of them.  

The first one, is a customer with a high speed connection.  50 megabit!  That's something serious.  (If you have any doubt, call up your local ma-bell and see what 50meg metro ethernet costs..)  Now the customer has history, the people we lease the 50 meg line through for them, have failed in recent history.  

....  So we enter my part of the story.  A ticket gets escalated to my queue, because nobody else has any idea what's going on.  I call Mr Wormwood, as he's listed on the ticket.  

At the same time, Ms Honey, the manager of the other department, is sending e-mails and attaching the office manager's name, and cell phone number to the ticket.  

I find their interface, check their traffic. They're moving virtually no traffic over their 50 meg circuit.  Since it's a resold line, I can't actually check the demarc equipment, so I roll a ticket with the telco.  Here is where I made my mistake.  I didn't do a show arp.  That command would have shortened this by an hour or two.  

I called and spoke to Mr Wormwood, their ""technical"" person on site, who tells me they've rebooted their firewall, and they're still going out their backup T1.  I ask what kind of firewall it is, they tell me it's brand, and feeling confident it's not sonicwall stupidity, we move on.  In my head, ""your equipment is good, my equipment is good, it must be the telco.""  I tell the Mr Wormwood I'm going back to the telco, and I'll have an update on a dispatch solution within the hour.  

Twenty minutes after I promise an hour callback to Mr Wormwood, Ms Honey calls me.  The customers office manager is freaking out.  And I need to call Ms Trunchbull back immediately.  She needs answers, and needs to know the fix, now.  

Tennatively, I pick up the phone, and make the call.  Ms Trunchbull believes that because she's spending a lot of money on her internet, we manage her network.  She also believes that we own the DMARC equipment.  I explain that we're already working on it.  But she won't have any of it.  

**Trunchbull:** ""My internet's been down for 13 hours, this isn't acceptable.  We're paying you thousands of dollars a month, this shouldn't happen.""

**Nerobro:** ""I'm sorry, you reported this issue less than an hour ago.  I promised Mr Wormwood that I'd have an answer from the local telephone company in an hour. We need to give them time to work.""

**Trunchbull:** ""You need to fix this now, you need to send someone out here to check out your equipment.  There's a red light on the box here, that has to be the probelm.  I pay you lots of money, you should dispatch right away!""

**Nerobro:** ""The equipment on site, isn't owned by me.  It's owned by the local Telco.  Even if I sent someone there, they aren't equipped to diagnose, test, or replace that equipment.  I have a ticket open with the local telco, and we'll have that fixed as soon as we can.""

I finally get her off the phone, and go back to troubleshooting.   I get permission to dispatch someone there, I call the telco to insist someone goes out.  My manager having already okeyed any costs involved.  

I go back to checking the line.  I finally issue the magic ""show arp"" command.  I see the customers firewall arped up.  So I try pinging it.  Shockingly, it responds.  And it responds with a decent ping considering the 500 miles, dozen routers and switches, between my desktop and their office.  

I call Ms Trunchbull back.  Because Mr Wormwood isn't answering the phone.  Ms Trunchbull just wants to complain.  

**Trunchbull:**  ""I can't be on the phone, I'm supposed to be in a meeting.  My internet has been down for 15 hours now, why can't you get someone here to fix it?""

**Nerobro:** ""The dispatch requests are already pending.  Those take some time.  The telco we can expect to take another couple hours.  And we're still waiting for my dispatch department to get me an answer.  But, I did some further testing.  It seems your internet might be ok.  Could you check it for me?""

**Trunchbull:**  ""FINE.  No, still the same problem.  I can't reach my webmail or my citrix server.  It's not working.  Send someone out.""

**Nerobro:**  ""I didn't see any traffic when you tried to connect.  I'd really like to check out the network on your side.  Is there anyone techni..........""

**Trunchbull:** ""NO.  Everyone technical is in the meeting.  I need to be back in there.  Just send someone out to fix it.""

**Nerobro:**  ""I understand, but I think we need to have someone check out your firewall.  I'd like to know how it determines which link is up""

**Trunchbull:** ""No, we don't have access to the firewall.  We're not going to pay our consultants to look at the firewall.  I can't believe this, your service is terrible.  If we weren't under contact I'd drop you right now.  And that red light is still on.  Fix it.""

**Nerobro:**  ""I am working on getting people out there.  When my tech arrives, he will only be able to test the internet connection.  I am quite sure his tests will prove the connection is fine.  If that's the case, we'll still need someone technical on your side to address the issue.""

**Trunchbull:** ""Just get someone here.""

So.. we did.  

About an hour later one of our supermen of field services get's on site.  He plugs in, tests it.  And it works.  50 meg both ways.  For good measure, he reboots their firewall again.  

.....  And their internet comes back.....

An hour later, the Telco Tech shows up too.  Turns out the dmarc equipment has a red light on the Ethernet port that the customer is not plugged in to.  Something that's not a problem at all.  Just a spare port they could use.  

The next day, I get an e-mail update from Ms Honey.  It turns out that 8.8.8.8 was flaking out that day, and the customers firewall used ONLY 8.8.8.8 to determine which connection was up and working.  So their firewall was failing over to the backup T1.  

Customer was down for 13 hours...  Ten minutes with their network people would have brought them back up.

I took off a few years, enjoyed life, but the guy who bought my stores asked me to come back and help him open up a bunch of them all around the state. Wife and I talked it over, finally decided to do it. 

First, I had to get the original ones back into shape, since they'd pretty much been run into the ground.

That's where I've been lately, btw.

Anyway, last night this batshit crazy woman came in (I'd had a few run-ins with her before) claiming that I was obligated to give her the ""Windows Anytime Upgrade"" license key.

Huh? 

I showed her that ""Windows Anytime Upgrade"" wasn't specifically a *version* of Windows, but a program through which someone could upgrade their version of Windows from Home to Professional or Ultimate.

She didn't believe me and kept repeating that she'd spent an hour on the phone with Microsoft and that they'd told her she'd have to talk to the people who'd sold her the system.

I kept telling her that there wasn't an ""Anytime Upgrade"" version of windows so finally she navigated to the Properties screen, pointed triumphantly at the Windows Edition and the copyright notice underneath and said accusingly, ""You didn't even sell me a current version! This one is from 2009 and I bought the computer in 2012!""

""Ma'am, that's the copyright notice. There is no specific 2009 version of Windows 7. It's constantly updating.""

""ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME THE WINDOWS ANYTIME KEY OR NOT?!?!?!!""

It was at this time that I finally lost it. My employees were shaking with laughter, tears streaming down their faces, trying to hold it in and failing.

""Ma'am, I can't give you a key to SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST!""

She glared at me, took out antiseptic wipes, cleaned everything I'd touched, grabbed her computer, and left. 

I can't wait to see her again. Apparently she'd been causing the employees hell for over a year and the ones that were left (that I didn't fire, actually -- it was a massacre) hated her and have really enjoyed seeing me interact with her.

Good times.

Ice-berg,16,51,1pgmva,251,"Hi everyone, many entertaining stories here, thought I’d share one of the funnier ones that happened to me over the few memorable years I spent as tech support.



Now I was working for a fairly big ISP in Canada, and our services overlapped both Quebec and Ontario, and on top of regular customer support, during graveyard shifts we would take over the business side as well as the 611 emergency phone. Now the latter was a different phone, which we had to manually answer, and set aside our headset.



This one night was like any other, not very busy, but enough to make me cringe at every phone call. At some point around 11 some guy calls on the 611 phone, so I put down my headset, put the ringer on, and pick up. It was a random dude that had his long-distance plan cut off, probably because he wasn’t paying or some shit, and he wanted me to transfer him to a long-distance call. I let him know politely that I wasn’t a receptionist, and wasn’t going to do that. After he argued for a while but got nothing from my poker face he hung up. He then calls again 2 minutes later, obviously pissed off he got the same guy (I was the only guy working) and after yet another 3-5 minutes of arguing, he hangs up. Now he calls a third time and I’m starting to get pissed off so I start to raise my voice a little and tell him “Sir, this is an emergency line, and you will either stop calling here, or I will have to call the police.” He shut up and became docile, and hung up. Didn’t hear from him again.



Now this might all look normal and all, but a day later my boss calls me in his office because there was a complaint from a customer concerning a call he made, and the boss wanted me to listen to the conversation. It was this guy calling, who I remembered nothing of, asking questions, and my answers made not much sense which really confused me. He kept on going and going, and at some point I can hear myself say “Sir, this is an emergency line and you will either stop calling here, or I will have to call the police”. The guy then proceeds to yell out “BUT I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING!!!!”

Turns out I failed when I set the ringer on, and a guy ended up on my headset, and was asking me questions while I was talking with the other guy on the 611 phone, and the answers vaguely matched his questions. Needless to say my boss was laughing his ass off, but still said… this can’t happen again!



TL;DR – When you take off your headset, make sure you set the ringer on. Funky things happen if you don’t.

My girlfriend and I decided to go for dinner. Best location to eat fish is near the lake, so we drove to a restaurant there, looking for a calm evening by the water after a stressful day at work. We were enjoying our meal, when suddenly, she stopped talking and made some strange faces. Apparently, a fish bone got stuck deep in her throat. 

Fast forward to the specialist the hospital sent us to, we ended up sitting in front of a big flat screen, connected to the endoscope the doctor shove down her throat to search for that bone. We both hope he comes to an end since the gagging noises combined with looking inside her on a big screen while she's holding my hand and almost crushing it made me feel a bit uncomfortable.

""Ah, found it!"", the doc said. Just in that relieving moment, a mouse cursor began its movements on the screen, which made me ask him if that's usual. The cursor minimized the endoscope display, opened up some folders and began sending some files by email. ""Oh, that's my coworker, apparently he needs some files"", pulls out his endoscope to shut down teamviewer, then restarted his journey of searching her throat.

cybervegan,35,26,1perz0,176,"Inspired by reading http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1pab88/f5_key_takes_down_entire_application_server/ here's a similar tale from my time at a small IT services company:

Nagios alerts started rolling in for a customer's web-site: web response
time over threshold, web server threads, cpu maxed, database server
connections maxed. Having trouble logging in via SSH 'cause the load is
so high. By the time I eventually got logged in, it's subsiding.
Because the customer's web app is a hairy ball of sloppy perl
fuzziness, this happens sometimes, so I let the customer know, and get
back to other work. 

Next morning, the guy who's rota'd for out-of-hours support moans that
he got a few alerts from the customer the previous night, but it had
recovered by the time he got to look at it. I opened up a few terminals
to key servers on a virtual desktop and left them logged in ""just in
case""... A little later in the morning, we get more alerts, but this
time they don't abate. I can see a large number of requests going
through the web server, lots of concurrent requests to the database
server all using the same table. Further log surfing reveals that it
was ALL coming from ONE IP address, all requesting the same URI. The
database is blocking on updating a particular table, which I noted down.

I black-holed the IP address, and watched the servers return to normal
processing.

So I then contacted the customer to let them know what had happened,
and after discussion we ascertained that it was a ""hit counter"" column
that was being hammered. I'm asked to track the culprit down, as we
agree it's probably a DoS attack of some sort.

After checking whois and then wrangling with the abuse hotline number
of the source IP's owner (a well-known UK telco) I ascertain that the
IP is owned by a SCHOOL. The telco agrees to contact the school. This
gets passed on to the web site owners.

Then, later that day, the problem re-occurred. This time, the IP was
different, but the URI was the same. So I black-holed it, and started
the whois-abuse-hotline dance again. Turns out that the new IP is a
domestic one, owned by a different telco, but in a very similar area.
The telco agreed to contact their customer.

The next day, I follow up with calls to both telco's. Turns out it was
a 9 y/o primary school kid, ""just trying to get the hit counter to
1,000,000"" on his club's homepage. He had started out by wedging a bit
of scrunched up paper into the gap by the f5 key on the keyboard of one
of the school PC's. When that wasn't fast enough, he'd graduated to
greasemonkey in firefox, but of course, that had stopped working when
I'd black-holed the school's IP. Later, he'd set it going overnight on
the family PC, but that had got logged out. The following afternoon,
when he'd got home, he had opened as many tabs as he could with firefox
and started greasmonkey auto-refreshing in each one, until I had then
black-holed that IP.

The web-site owners were out for blood, but I persuaded them against
taking it any further than getting the parent's telco to tell them they
were in breach of their acceptable use policy, and the school hauling
the kid over the coals and giving him an ""official warning'. I think
the lad must have wet himself, and probably got a spaking from his
parents too. He wrote an apology letter to the web-site owners,
promising never to do it again. It took a fair bit of diplomacy on my
part to prevent them from going full rottwieller and getting the
parents internet cut off.

For my part, I told the web-site owners they should code the site so
that this type of trick wouln't cause the site to go down, because how
were kids (a large part of the site's target audience) supposed to
understand that something as apparently trivial as incrementing a hit
counter could bring the site to its knees?

I think the kid learnt his lesson well enough, and eventually the site
was hardened against such ""attacks"".

She then came to me asking how to keep this from happening again:

**Coworker**: ""The computer is loading ok now. What can I do to prevent this kind of issue?""

**Me**: ""It depends on the problem. Why did it break, or what was going on?""

**Me**: ""Well... I don't think that'll help. Did you go through the error logs?""

**Coworker**: ""No, I just want to know how to keep it from breaking again. I'll have them defrag it.""

  Dumbnonymous liked to come in the store and tell anyone who would listen that he was a master hacker.  Being that he was 60 years old, had one of his eyes that could look around the corner while the other looked straight ahead, always had this creepy smile on his face and weighed probably 300lbs plus, I figured there could be some smidgen of truth here.  Just a smidge though.  I can't imagine any hacker announcing this to everyone he comes in contact with. 

  One day Dumbnonymous comes in to buy a computer and one of my associates is helping him.  Bright guy, writes his own programs.
  I am listening in as my associate is helping him.  Dumbnonymous isn't let him get in a word edge wise as to the best of what I can recall, he was saying things like;

""I'm a hacker.  The government has been after me for years!""
""They can't catch me though.""

  I'm watching my associate who is clearly annoyed and rolling his eyes as Dumbnonymous sings his own praise.  My associate talks to him about the services we offer such as set up and the dreaded service plan and of course, Dumbnonymous is rejecting all as he sings his own praise again and again being a hacker. 

  Then I hear Dumbnonymous contradict himself.  
""I'm not supposed to be buying a computer.  It's illegal for me to own one since the government busted me.""  Uh, what?  Two minutes ago they couldn't catch you and now you have been busted?  

So we get dumbnonymous his laptop which of course was the cheapest piece of crap we sold.  He is at our tech counter checking out.  I am there because he is paying by check and I have to verify it due to the amount.

""What should I use to back this up?  Floppy's or can I use CD's?""

""How do I make the recovery disks?""  Well, Dumbnonymous, that's a service we offer.  (Sorry, after wasting half an hour with this dude, no simple info for free!  Besides, he is a MASTER HACKER!)

Cue me coming out with multiple, creative and colourful adjectives to describe the mistake he had just made and possibly his parents too.

SkraeNocturne,8,13,1pdxwa,57,"Admittedly, the title is misleading, as I know to check my email already, and I don't think that the user in question is going to learn to check hers.

Thursday, I found out from the COO of the client at which I work on-site, that one of the warehouses was having issues for a week and had called Canon to try to get repairs done.  Canon came out and told them that parts were supposed to be here Friday.  Fine, I wish I'd been informed before the meeting with the COO, but fine, it's getting handled.  Since this is one of the shipping warehouses, if they can't print, they can't ship (they need the packing lists), so the COO asks me, ""What can we do to get them back up and running?""

Thinking quickly, trying to achieve the goal of as little inconvenience as possible, I remembered that the CSR was out of the office for her birthday, so I suggest to him that I snag her printer and bring it over there.  He agrees, so I shoot off an email to the user letting her know what is going on, load up the printer, and drop it off at the warehouse.

Come today, the CSR is back, and the printer has not been repaired.  I don't even have a chance to sit down and eat my breakfast before she starts chewing me out about how she can't do her job and she's behind two days and she's got 160 emails to print out and reply to (she has two monitors, there's really no need to print them).  For bonus points she complains about how it's a real pain in the ass for her to get up and walk ten feet.

Evidently, she'd been emailing her manager (with the level of organization here, I had no idea that she had a manager, it's that bad) and the ""IT manager"" asking if they knew anything.  They did not as the COO had authorized it, and neglected to inform them (in hindsight, I should have informed the ""IT manager,"" if only to CMA).  She would have figured this out if she had checked her email first.

I called the warehouse in question a few minutes ago, evidently, the parts are actually coming in today, supposedly.  I wonder when they're actually to come out and repair it, and if it will be before I burn this place down...

TollhouseFrank,19,58,1pdugk,378,"Another magical tale from my job at the now closed dial-up company
*****

It was a dark and stormy night.  The snow was pouring.  I knew it would be a terrible, cold, slow drive home (i lived 45 minutes away at normal Interstate speeds of 70mph, driving that far in 6 inches of snow takes a lot longer when you are doing it at 25mph all the way).  I was preparing my things and getting ready to head out and make the 4 block walk to the parking lot when the phone rang.  


I cringed.  I sighed.  I said some unsavory words that should never be uttered by man, beast, or Admin.  I took off my coat, set my things down, and answered the phone.  It quickly turned into a 'noise on the lines' issue (probably the most common issue with dial-up).  It didn't take very long, and the guy on the other end was apologetic as he knew I had a long drive in the snow into the mountains ahead of me (as I've said before, when you work at a small company, you end up knowing a lot of the regular customers/callers and become friends with them).  


Near the end of the call, I ask the guy to dial-up and make sure it works.  I knew he was one of our few customers who had 2 phone-lines, so it was easy to do this and not have to wait on a call-back.  He started the process.  I hear the modem chirp over his phone.  Then everything gets mussed up with heavy static.  I hear a loud ""whaboomthump*MUTHAF#$#$#*""


I tell the guy on the other end to go check on it, and I can call for help if he needs.  He says he'll be right back.  He comes back about a minute later, half laughing, half cussing.  This is the (sanitized) conversation:
*****
Me:  So, what happened?  Do I need to call for help for you since your lines are messing up?


Guy:  Don't bother.  That mother-loving brother of mine, Bubba, was up on the roof trying to shovel off snow, slipped, and on his way down, grabbed the dang phone line and tried to use it to keep his poopy butt from falling off the roof.  


Me:  Are you sure you don't need me to call for him?  He might need to go to the hospital.


Guy:  No.  I done drug his broken butt inside.  We'll get the phone company out here to fix it when the snow melts.  You get yourself home.


Me:  Sure thing.  Have a great evening, and go easy on Bubba.  It coulda been worse - he could have grabbed the cable line.


Guy:  I'd have left his butt outside if he woulda done that.  Don't ever be a reason to miss Rasslin'!

I have played tech support for my Nana since highschool (Completed Uni and working as an Engineer now - that has its own stories to tell). In that time she has always tried her best to understand computers, but has always struggled for a variety of reasons, the biggest of which being her severe arthritis.

Recently she was encouraged to buy a new computer (last one was running Windows Vista and had slowed down to the point where it was unusable) so her and my Pop (who rather enjoys using his laptop for checking emails and playing card games) went and bought a new HP Windows 8 machine from JB Hifi (""it was the one the young person said we should buy"").

After two days I was receiving complaints and queries about ""this new Windows 8 piece of sh*t"" computer (their words, not mine). After some troubleshooting I discovered it was a case of too much change, too quickly.

They didn't want to go back to Vista but didn't want to pay for another Windows license, so I offered to install Ubuntu on their old (now unused) Vista machine (12.04LTS for those wondering) and run them through how to use it, just as a trial - if they didn't like it we'd work out something else to make Windows 8 a little more familiar to them.

It's been 8 days since installing Ubuntu and giving them a ""how-to"" lesson for an hour (I actually enjoy teaching them computer things because they really try to learn and take in as much as possible). In that 8 days I have received 1 phone call, which was a quick call to say everything had gone well.

My Nana had figured out how to change the wallpaper, discovered how to make the on-screen font bigger, has installed her own card game applications from the software store, and has completely adjusted to Thunderbird for her emails (""The delete button was down the bottom, took me ages to find it - but I found it!"" - Nana). She's now convinced she'll never use a Windows machine again if it can be helped.

I'm not trying to start a Linux V. other OS war, nor trying to say that Ubuntu is the Linux distro for everyone. I just wanted to share my experience with an old lady who didn't take well to the adjustment to Windows 8 and has found Ubuntu to be a dream. I couldn't be more proud of her.

DistributorOfPain,7,15,1pcyk3,54,"Hello all, this is my first time posting (long-time lurking) but something that happened last week finally got my ass in gear. First, some background: 

I work for a very, *very* large HCIT company in the Front End (Windows focused) organization. We're split into six geographical regions with two engineers apiece. My direct coworker and I manage the Central clients. Part of our jobs include implementing and helping to architect new/upgraded Active Directory structures for our client. I'm sure that many of you here, much like myself, remember your classes where (with sufficient practice) you could get an entire AD environment with WSUS, DNS, etc. setup in an afternoon. Would that this were class...Where things get hairy is with the volume (50 clients in our region alone) and expansiveness (Visio and Outlook...all the time) of these implementations. From an Infrastructure perspective, this requires *at least* the regional FE engineers, an architect, a build team member and a Networking engineer; usually, there's more but that's the skeleton crew. On the client team/client side, this requires the *entire* client team (4-7 people, usually) and most of the client side folks (4-~1/2 the population of China). 

To give some perspective, from start to finish, a successful AD integration/upgrade can take just under a month but we've still got one that's coming up on 8 months. This entire process is hampered due to the fact that (with 700+ clients) no two are exactly alike. All other things being turned down, as it were, getting Domain Controllers is a big part of the process; this usually requires anywhere from 4-8 DCs: two Child Domain Controllers and two client Domain Controllers, plus any ancillary resources they may need. This is supposed to be coordinated with all the folks I mentioned above and have all the necessary tickets in-line. And this is where we make a hard left turn...

On Friday afternoon, I had a client-team engineer ping me over Lync saying that he was having issues with DNS. Due to solving some nasty CNAME confusion a while back along with making internal documentation, I've kind of become the de facto DNS guy in our region. Anywho, having worked with this guy before (and him being pretty good...for a client-team guy), I decide to play ball and offer to help. It essentially boiled down to him not being able to make an A record in the client's DNS zone. Now, due to an incident last year that I'm not sure if I can legally talk about, they yanked GUI privileges in the DNS snap-ins. This means that they have to use the scripting tool to make any changes; this works great for changes within the parent and child domains...not so much when you need to add one in a client zone. He needed to make an A record there...

I finally just offered to do it myself (I can add myself, briefly, to Ent. Admin.) and got the info for the record. It was for a DC...that we had no knowledge of...in the client's zone. What? Naturally, I inquired about the status of this DC, thinking that maybe something just got past me and was worked by my coworker. Nope. Nobody in Infrastructure had heard of this DC; not me, not my coworker, not the architects, not nobody. So, WTF. Where did this box come from and how did it get into implementation? 

To make a long story (somewhat) short, what this enterprising client-team engineer had requested Domain Controllers properly but failed to engage the people who set them up, design the architecture and ensure a proper environment. Him and his team did everything, including DCpromo, by themselves without any type of advice, input or oversight. In a perverse way, it's kind of impressive but what makes this scary is that they were ready to pull the trigger on this and shove everything out into production. If I had created that record, they would've put the DCs in prod and they promplty would've tombstoned and died. Fortunately, this guy played pretty straight and was willing to listen to me, my coworker and the architect with more time in the company than us put together. So, after 4 hours of investigation, an hour-long conference call, multiple tickets being opened and much hypertension, we're getting rid of the incorrect DCs, getting new ones, coordinating with the client and Networking and generally doing things right.

Some days, the computer problems I must deal with are entirely software based. However, today I came up against one that was entirely user based.

It was about 12 pm, and after waking up, I started up my laptop with the intent of finishing some homework. While my laptop booted up, and as I logged on to various education sites (blackboard, anyone?) I hear a steady ""brrzzrrzzz brzzrzzz bzzrrzz"" sound in the room. Inspecting first my laptop (no dice, the fan was running fine), and my phone (ringer set to off), I finally determined that the sound was coming from above me (I sleep in the basement, and my room is right below my family's computer room).

Wondering what the sound was, I went upstairs to my families computer room, the room above mine. To my horror, I saw my little brother, on his computer, browsing YouTube, with his feet immersed in on of those foot spa things - essentially a vibrating bucket full of *water* - about 3 inches away from the wall outlet the computer was plugged into.

I promptly yelled at my brother about what he thought he was doing, putting large amounts of water near electrical sockets to which 600$ devices, and one very important life, were near. Suffice to say, he looked pretty guilty, and took the foot spa machine away and dumped it in the sink.

Jason1313,61,74,1pa0ks,364,"Background: 

I work for a small CLEC that still provides DSL service. Most of the DSL customers are elderly and not very computer literate. I also only work on the weekends, which is a popular time for DSL customers to call in.

Story:

Today I had a customer with DSL connection issues, no big deal, most common problem with DSL customers. The issue was some misconfigured settings on her computer that we needed to change. So I needed her to change the settings of the network connection and the following is the conversation that occurred:

Me: Alright, just right click on the network connection and then click on properties.

Her: You know I'm left handed, right?

Me: I'm sorry, I actually did not know that. Is there an issue with the network connection?

Her: No, it's just that my right click is different than your right click.

Me: ...

Me: That's fine, just use your right click to click on the network connection.

Her: Ok, a new window opened.

And to those of you that may be thinking that it's a modified mouse or she changed the settings in Windows, she didn't. It was a brand new, pre-built Dell computer.

The beauty of this is that for the most part I don't have to deal with users unless it's for a particular project or if there's a problem with an application that the Help Desk can't fix.  

However, since I'm part of the ""IS Operations"" group, I get a copy of all the regular help desk + NetOps report - There's usually a DSR (daily support report), SSR (supplemental support report), and NSR (nightly support report) that come daily.  These reports are usually a great highlight of my day as I get to see the sheer stupidity of users (we like to call them Pakleds, as they seek things to make them go) and generally don't have to deal with them.

This one however, make me just break down with laughter:

&gt; ABC - Called because keyboard supposedly wasn't working.  Rode out to location in plant to find out she had a wireless keyboard and it needed batteries.  ABC said she thought they just got power from the computer and didn't need batteries.  This is her third strike.  Removed wireless keyboard/mouse and replaced with wired units.  Added ABC to the list of users that can't have nice things.

The next day, I was talking to one of the help desk guys and learned that there are over 150 users on this list.  It's now department policy that only users in IS or those that have demonstrated sufficient technical competence to understand wireless keyboards/mice require batteries are allowed to have them.

Wow, just wow.  I'm so glad I'm not working help desk support anymore.

This particular time I came to his garage / shop near his double-wide and he wasn't going to be home. His wife (Linda) would be there and would let me in the garage where I could resolve what ever issues he was having this time. 

I arrive at 11am, get to the door and knock. Linda opens the door and I'm overcome with this massive waft of cigarette smoke and that smell of alcohol oozing from human pores. 

Linda was hammered. I swear I could see the alcohol fumes pouring out of her body bending the am light as it oozed from her leathery, worn skin.  

She was upright, but limp - a professional alcoholic.

sadak5,4,20,1p7ozo,67,"today, I will tell a history of an overrated developer, a know-it-all one. All inspired by this: http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1p7k1g/time_zones_how_do_they_work/

I had a external provider for a project some ""users"" wanted. A mobile app where their clients could check some info. An app that we, the IT area, knew the real clients will never use.

First, I must tell you that this external provider works representing teams of indie developers, and he assigns the projects as he wishes (He says is depending the skill needed). He asigned us the best developers for this (his claims).

I developed a web service (using WCF) to provide them with all the info the app needed from our DB. I even documented the calls, parameters and results, how to call the functions and in what order to work. Even made an example app. All the documentation and the example app was sent to them.

When testing a webpage his team did in asp.net, my boss and I noticed the displayed time was in UTC time (we are based in Mexico, so is -6 UTC when DST is not active, and -5 when is active). My boss reported the issue and the developer responded when it was done. We checked, seemed normal (this was around 4 months ago).

Relevant to this history is the fact that at the end of the development the developer must deliver all the code in order to get paid.

We crossed with a lot issues with their team, as they only tested from 9 PM to 1 AM CST. We leave the office at 7 PM CST when going home late. Also, they never understood (I honestly think they never looked at) my documentation, even when it said exatly how to do the things, or the example app that did almost all.

2 months ago, they reported an ""issue"" with the webservice (in WCF) I did for this project, and we requested to them to send us the code to debug it.

When I was testing their code, i found one thing than not only caused the head-meet-desk moment, but also make me lost the faith in their team.

In the code, when the date was displayed, the ""brilliant"" developer had put an "".addHours(-5)"" in the code behind. Not only once, but in every page that was contained in the project.

After checking that the issue was not with the WCF service but in the way the called it, I repoted the results to my boss, and also told him of that dreaded code. I remember telling him ""what do they think? That we will go changin the -5 to -6 when DST ends and change back when it begins the next year?"". My boss reportet this and the developer didn't said a thing about this.

Later, one of the design of the pages was changed during the development, and the hour was scrapped from it (only the hour of the date, the day, month and year was still being showed). We thought that the timezone issue was fixed.

Later in the development, I was contacted by another developer, one that wasn't assigned to us, asking fro all the documentation again. We were puzzled, and I sent him the info. He thanked me and explained that the provider passed the project to him, as it was taking too long to finish. Also, my boss and I noted a huge diference this time, as this developer contacted me directly, and the one before him never, only using the provider as communication bridge.

At the end of the development, acouple of weeks later, we received the code, and I had not only to mount it in IIS, but also recreate the solution package with all the folder tree and references in Visual Studio, as we received only the folder that rests in the IIS server when the app is published.

When I was doing this, I checked the code, and the dreaded  "".addHours(-5)"" was still there!. WTF!.

I don't know too much of ASP.NET, I'm more like a windows developer, but I know how to use google. A quick search and thre of the top links provided the solution we needed: Forcing the timezone to ""es-MX"". I then procceded to delete those manual adjustements, test it and publish it. I reported to my boss this and asked the last developer if he saw that. 

He said that He never saw it, he just fixed the calls to the WCF service that were in another file, using the example app I provided. He even thanked me for said app, as he didn't knew anything of WCF when the project was passed to him.

At this day, the provider has already received their payment, the ""production"" app that is published in the appStore and Google Play is not finished (that code is not being deliverd to us yet, but my Boss has the contract to sue them if not theliver the code), but all the asp.net pages that it uses are working fine.

ay_gov,21,32,1p7k1g,160,"Hello TFTS!!!  This is my first time posting so I apologize in advance for the inevitable formatting errors. This also got a bit wordier than I intended.

 I work as a sys admin for a university somewhere in the great state of Illinois. Our department (Infrastructure) consists of me, another sys admin, a useless temp sys admin, a networking guru, and our boss. We are responsible for all the servers and networking within the university.  

Now to the story! About an hour ago I received a call from my boss. Apparently some users are having issues with email messages being delayed. Can I check the queues on the Exchange server since the delay for one message seems to be in the 2 hour range? He’ll forward me the message in question.

I get the forwarded email chain and my first observation is the person who made the complaint.  She is the project manager for the entire IT department (infrastructure, enterprise apps, help desk, desktop support, multi media services) and she is terrible to work with.  Technically she is part of IT, but she completely fails at understanding even the most basic of IT concepts.  

Here is what she sent to my boss:

&gt;Any idea why admin assitant’s email below is time-stamped with 8:53am, but it actually shows in my in-box as arriving at 10:53am? It would appear that it sat around for two hours, when I really just got it and webmaster responded before I had a chance to (but she did give him the right answer!). 

Sure enough looking further down the email chain and it does appear that the webmaster (who replied to all first) received the email at 8:53am. *sigh*  I have a hunch why this is, but I had better do my due diligence just to CYA.

I log in to the exchange management console and look at the queue viewer and see nothing stacked up.  Messages are flowing normally. To be doubly sure this isn't some server gremlin I fire up the message tracker, plunk in the relevant details, and look at that. The message was sent at 10:53am.  So it is what I thought... 

A little back story regarding the webmaster.  For some strange reason the university seems to think she is irreplaceable.  She has already quit and been begged back with a massive raise once.  Over the summer her husband accepted a job in Arizona so naturally she put in her notice.  Not so naturally the university responded by offering to allow her to work remotely... from Arizona.

So the webmaster is in Arizona and the project manager is in Illinois.  Besides climate and geographical location what else is different between those two places?  The time zone... with DST exemption Arizona is currently 2 hours behind Illinois.

I had to spend 20 minutes of my day on a failure to understand time zones...

Hi [Warehouse Guy],

I am a temporary worker working for [CU's boss, who I don't know either] in Nursing Administration. [3rd person I've never heard of, AA], her usual administrative assistant, submitted an old laptop that needed upgrading sometime in the last 2-3 months. [Boss] received a thinkpad back from you guys that is not hers and the laptop is missing in action.

Since I am the temp, I don’t have any ticket #s or foreknowledge of who [AA] submitted the cpr to, or even whether she used her name or [the boss's]. Can you please look this up and locate and return to us as [boss] really needs to fulfill her duties here @ [ACME healthcare]? Your due diligence on our behalf is much appreciated.   


If you have any questions, please call me @ ext. [666]  


Regards,

Balorn,70,115,1p6ece,602,"The other day, I got a call from someone having trouble writing to a CD. It's a dual 6-core Xeon workstation with 64 GB RAM, but sure, I'll help you figure out how to put your PowerPoint on a CD. 

Okay, fairly routine call. I connect in remotely so I can see what they're doing. I confirm both drives (they have both a DVD writer and a Blu-ray writer) are detected by the system, and ask them to put in a blank disc. They do and say they hear it spin up, but nothing happens. Try the other drive, same result. I have them find a pre-made program disc, in case the blank is just messed up, but that can't be read either.

Now, if they'd only had one drive I probably would have been setting up a replacement at this point, but it's pretty unlikely for two drives in the same system to be failing like this, so I press on.

While trying each drive, I notice them calling one drive ""left"" and the other ""right"". Okay, system is on its side. Not a big deal as most drives can handle that. Still, perhaps these ones are being overly sensitive, so I have the user put the system upright so one drive is above the other. 

This time, when I have them put in a disc, they're having trouble getting it lined up in the tray. This doesn't make much sense to me; it should be even easier now. I ask if there's a spindle in the middle they have to snap the disc onto; no, there's these plastic pieces in the way. ""Must be those movable tabs some drives have to hold the disc in when the drive is vertical,"" I think, but when I ask them to just slide the tabs back out of the way, they say it's all one piece and no part moves.

Finally, I have them take a picture of the drive tray and send it to me. This is an adventure in itself, but nothing really unusual all things considered.

Space_Ace,21,34,1p5y3m,130,"Long time reader, first time poster.  That whole song and dance.  

I'm not the typical IT that most of you seem to be.  My job is just medical software support.  The company I work for sells their product to hospitals, testing labs, even veterinarians, so we have a few thousand clients. If the user can't get results, needs to change a test, they can't send messages, faxes, emails, etc. from one site to another, that's me.   However, we get the occasional call that is clearly not within our realm.  

This most recent event occurred when I was on-call.  At approximately 3 a.m. I receive a call that someone cannot log in.  Simple enough, unlock their account and find someone to reset their password.  Since it's impossible to know which less than capable individual is on the other end of a phone line when they are in one of thousands of supported labs, I can't just change their password for them.  Their own administrator for the software has to do it.  Either way, I call her up and ask her what I can do to help.  The exchange went something like this:

Me: Hi, this is Space_Ace from Medical Software Company.  What seems to be the problem?

Her: Yes, I'm not able to log on.  Can you help me?

Me: Not a problem.  Would you be able to start a support session for me so I can take a look at your system?

Her: No I can't do that.  I can't log on the computer.

Me: Oh.  So it's not a problem with the software, it's the workstation itself?

Her: Yes, can you reset my password please?

Me: I'm sorry but I don't have the access or authority to do that.

Her: I thought this was computer support.

Me: It is, but for the software that you use.  I can't change your password.

Her: Oh.  If you can't do it then who can?

Me: My guess is your internal IT department should be able to do that for you.  Do you know how to contact them?

Her:  No.  What is their number?

Me: I honestly have no idea.  I'm not even in the same state as you.  I would ask someone near you to see if they can help because I unfortunately cannot at this time.

JousterL,116,49,1p5n67,195,"Been lurking for a while, but today's little escapade was just too crazy to resist. It involves something I'm surprised I've yet to see show up in these stories, but won't be surprised to see more of in the near future. CryptoLocker. If chills didn't just run up your spine, I envy you your blissful ignorance.

Got a call out to a client today, with a perfectly vague ""The T drive isn't working"". Asked for more information, tried to diagnose the issue over the phone... nada. They can see the files, but any time they try to open them, it either complains that the file is in use, or that it is corrupt. So I drive out there.

Conversation between me and J(redacted) is as follows: 

**Me**: I can't open these files, even from the server. Do you know when this started?  

**J**: This morning. P(redacted) hooked up her personal laptop to do a presentation and couldn't open the file. She said it was telling her she only had a couple hours to do... something... she thought it meant her battery was low and so she switched to the company laptop while leaving hers plugged in. Same problem.  

**Me**: (Can hear Taps playing in his head) Can I look at that personal laptop?

Sure enough, the 'battery low' warning was that all-too-familiar *""Your important files encryption produced on this computer""* yada yada. I ran to the computer and ripped the network cable out of it. Then I turned back to J.

**Me**: Your files are all encrypted, and there's nothing that I can do at this point to remove it. We can restore from backup though, so you don't... need to... (seeing J's face)

**J**: No, we can't. The backup drive stopped making noise. We were going to tell you about it the next time you came in.  

**Me**: O...k... in that case, we still have the off-site backups I helped you sign up for last year.  

**J**: Oh, those? I cancelled the subscription before it renewed, because we had the drive next to the server.  

**Me**: (At this point trying very hard to keep an even tone) Well, then you'll either need to pay the fee within... (peer over shoulder) 5 hours, or we start from scratch on all of the data your company has ever produced.

In order to keep this TFTS SFW, I'll refrain from giving the specific verbiage J had, as he suddenly started -screaming- at both me and P. Every third word was a curse, and some of the invectives were arranged in ways I hadn't heard before. Refusing to be baited for what wasn't my fault, I started walking for the door. He followed me, still screaming, threatening legal action, etc. As I was getting into my car, him standing next to me bellowing about how many lawyers he can stuff up my ***, I turned back and quietly handed him a copy of the finished backup proposal he had signed a year ago. I then closed my door and drove off.

TL;DR - How would you like your eggs? Scrambled or ransomed?

I just had what might be my biggest facepalm moment in the five years I've been doing support at the Fruit.

Cx comes in saying she can't get her fruit slate thingy to go in the web. It's a weefee only and it goes just fine here in the store. She drops the dime that she's from out of town and is visiting her kids (she's about 70). Apparently they bought it for her online and had it sent to her.

Okay so a few questions later I establish that her issue is that she can't get online because she doesn't have the weefees at home. I explain to her about getting a weefee box for get Internet etc. I even show her the fruit weefee box. 

She tells me she already has one but it isn't working. I ask if she had it with her and I'll get a tech to look at it. She says no. I suggest she calls fruit by phone support and she says she did and they were no help. All she wants is to get on the web etc. I explain that I can't help her without having the box unfortunately and we track down a local shop that can likely do a house call (I figured she was just confused about how to hook the router up). She leaves semi happy

I'm curious at this point so I do some backtracking and find the service record for her wifi router. I pull up the notes and about lose it.

She calls and the tech establishes that her computer goes on the web from a cable and tells her to pull that from the back and plug it into the router and connect to the Internet. She asks if she should call back or will the tech. Huh? Cause when she gets on the web she can't use the phone.

ConstableOdo,89,55,1p56gu,267,"So yesterday one of the guys who works in this office came in. He mostly works from home because he lives a state away. I think he is not very good at his job and he is the master of bullshit, so people think he is productive. We will call him WGS (Weapons-Grade Stupid).

So he comes in and does stuff for a few hours and comes to me. Now I wear a lot of hats in this company. I actually work for two companies. It's big and complicated and I have a LOT of work to do.

He tells me that something popped up on his computer yesterday and he can't get rid of it. I tell him ""just a second"" and finish what I am doing. I leisurely walk over to his computer. Usually when something has popped up it's ""You're sending this search over and unsecure..."" or ""Click to do [that thing he is trying to do.]"" WGS gets completely paralyzed by the computer.

So I go in and.... he has cryptolocker. I had never actually seen it before. And guess what it locked... All his work documents.

So I am bit perplexed. I had good, up to date antivirus on his computer. It updates automatically and scans every email. So I ask him. He turned it off. Why? Because he got a document in his email a week ago and couldn't open it. So he went in and quit it manually. I have no idea how he managed because he is really stupid. Let me just put that in plain language. WGS closed the antivirus, because it detected the threat and stopped him from opening the file.

Well, it's not that bad. I have his computer set to back everything up to a cloud service each night. I ask him for his username and password for him and I tell him I will retrieve the files and fix it. I get into the service and.... No back ups since September 18th.... 

I ask him about this. He said he turned it off because it would slow his computer for for half an hour each night while it backed up. 

So here we are. WGS's computer is encrypted with ransomware. I finally told him he was fixing it out of his own wallet. Pretty anti climatic. I am just baffled.

*****

Even though I do not remember the reason why, now, I had asked to swap one of my weekend shifts for a mid-week shift with a co-worker.  My manager ended up swapping with me as his wife had something to do that weekend and it gave him time to work on his project - he was working on programming the 32gpx and writing a new gui for it - so I could have that saturday off.


I come in to work Sunday, and everything is out of place.  It looks like someone has rifled through every drawer - even the financial officer's desk - and left in a hurry.  I call my manager and ask him what was up, as the door was locked when I got there, so it couldn't have been a break-in (this was 3 stories up with no windows to the outside, so no smash-n-grab either).  However, if it wasn't that way when he left, I was gonna call the police.


He told me to clean up what I could, but it was ok.  He would explain everything monday morning, because it was too long a tale to tell on the phone, as apparently, the police had already been there.

ME:  Uh, you weren't doing drugs, were you?  I mean, you look like a hippy, but you are clean as far as I know.


MAN:  I was confused too.  I had to get down on the ground with my hands on my head while they searched.  After 30 minutes, they gave up, and started asking questions.  When they got to what address this was (to confirm I wasn't high, I guess), I told them.  They started to arrest me until I asked them what address they thought it was.   They told me, then I started laughing and told them they had the wrong building, they wanted the crack-house across the street.

It gave me fuzzy feelings to read the support and advice of other people, and thank you to all who commented (although, as an update, I'm not giving my boss laxatives!)

Today's story happened yesterday, and it stars me - Glorious Keeper of Passwords - and one of our staff users, a new starter that we'll call Kirsty. Because that's her name.

When she started, her manager requested for an e-mail to be set-up for her, common procedure. I set it up, gave her manager the password and get back to my busy day of crying into a mug of coffee. It was one of those days where everything was going wrong - a whole other story - but just to set the scene a little more, my boss is running around shrieking because the phonelines have gone down at one of our supported services and the techie sent down there is only making things worse. In the midst of chaos and anger, my work phone rings.

**GKoP**: Yes, you've reached my work number. How can I help? 

**Kirsty**: You set up an e-mail for me today and I can't log in. You gave my manager the wrong password.

**GKoP**: I'm sorry you've been experiencing log-in difficulties, Kirsty. Could I take the log-in details you've been using? 

**Kirsty**: Yes, I've used k.******@*********** and the password is c-g-o...

**GKoP**: Let me just stop you there. The 'o' is actually a zero. Common mistake when I send the details over e-mail be-

**Kirsty**: What do you mean, it's a zero?? You can't use numbers in passwords!! They have to be actual words!

**GKoP**: I can confirm that I used a zero in your password, and I am able to log-in from my machine to your e-mail account with the password I have recorded on the database.

**Kirsty**: You're not even trying to log-in! I know for a fact that numbers don't work in passwords!

**GKoP**: Numbers are used in every password we have for added security. Our system *does* recognise them.

**Kirsty**: Well, I've never heard of anything like this. Are you sure it's not a capital (letter) o? 

**GKoP**: I am pretty sure I have not mistaken a zero for the letter o, but you can try that alternative if you like.

*slow typing can be heard*

**Kirsty**: THE ZERO ISN'T WORKING EITHER

**GKoP**: Okay Kirsty, please ch-

**Manager**: What's the problem?

**GKoP**: No problem, feel free to e-mail me with any further queries.

B1GTOBACC0,6,13,1p3cu5,62,"Background: I'm a ""field engineer"" (fancy title for ""the guy on site"") who works on contract. Jobs come in from a lot of managed IT companies.

So today, I arrived at a site to install a new Cisco 891, put their new Pace 4111n into bridge mode, then migrate existing connections from their old Adtran to the Cisco. I call into the company's help desk to speak with an admin and get PPP credentials. 

I get connected surprisingly quickly to a young man we'll call ""Thomas"". I inform him that yes, I have located the modem, yes I can surf on DHCP, and yes, the Cisco is already up on the wall. I just need PPP credentials for DSL to verify I can surf when the modem is bridged.

At this point, he informs me that ""You don't need to bridge the pace 4111n, it works without doing that, and the credentials are configured into the Cisco."" 

So I enter the PPP info, and lo and behold, cannot surf on the unbridged modem. I bridge the modem, and it works. 

So we connect the Cisco, and at his request, I leave my laptop connected to the modem so he can remote in and console into the router. He asks ""Is the router up?"" 

Me: ""Of course not, my laptop is using the credentials. If we unhook my laptop, it'll work, but you won't have remote access."" 

Him: ""No, it shouldn't matter. I'll call the carrier.""

Me: [unhooks laptop, reboots modem] ""Hey, the router just connected to the VPN.""

Thomas: ""Oh, ok. Oh wait, the remote session ended.""

Me: ""Yeah, it works like I said, only one device can use the credentials."" 

Carrier rep (who was apparently listening the whole time): ""So you don't need us?""

Thomas: ""No, I guess not. Ok, can you restart the remote session?""

Me: ""No, for the reason I just said.""

Thomas: ""Ok, see if the employees can surf out.""

Me: ""We rebooted his machine, and it's not getting anything via DHCP. Looks like a config issue.""

Thomas: ""Ok, I'll call the carrier.""

At this point, my palm is firmly embedded in my forehead. The carrier is giving you an IP, but internal DHCP is their fault? 

At this point, we're crossing the three hour mark, so I have to call for overtime approval. I get back on and inform him that the overtime is approved, but the store closes in 30 minutes.

Thomas: ""Ok, we have ATT on the line they're gonna walk you through bridging the modem.""

I calmly explain that if it's bridged, working, and handing down the correct IP, it is bridged correctly. The carrier agrees and hangs up. Thomas decides that ""We'll just have to call the carrier tomorrow. Here's your close code.""

TL;DR: Admin says modems don't need to be bridged for PPPoE, credentials for PPP can be used on multiple machines on the same circuit, internal DHCP problems are the carrier's fault, and I don't know how to bridge a modem even though it was working and providing the correct IP to the router.",The little admin that couldn't,75
ixiduffixi,16,24,1p39zl,179,"It has been some time since I have last posted. So, to update, I work for a rather well know Floral Network that provides a very specific type of POS to businesses. Our customers span from the US into Canada, and soon into AU. 

This particular tale is one of trust, false information, and a laughing department. Names have been altered to protect the identity of those involved. 

About 9:30 am CST I received a call from one of our West Coast customers, specifically Oregon. It was a very simple issue of failed overnight backups. The initial call went well enough. Remoted in, determined external HDD was not detected, then corrected. I told the customer, henceforth referred to as Jane Doe, that I would run a manual backup and call her back. 

Due to the shop being 2 hours behind my time zone, she stated that her shop is not open as of yet and all phone lines would be directed to the 24 hour answering service. Jane Doe gave me another number to contact her by, XXX-555-XXXX. I told her I would call her once the backup was finished to let her know I was done. The call ended and I proceeded.

The backups went through just fine, no issues whatsoever. But what I was not prepared was the following conversation when I called back. 

Me: Hey this is Duff from Blah Blah tech support. Is this Jane Doe?

Contact: Yes this is her. 

Me: Yeah, I was just going to let you know I'm done with your system and your backups are all fine.

Contact: Excuse me? What did you say your name was?

Me: Duff, from Blah Blah tech support?

Contact: I don't remember talking to a Duff. I don't know what you want but I'm not talking to you.

Me: Ma'am, this is Duff. We just spoke about your POS system.

Contact: No, I was not talking to any Duff. I was speaking with a lady. Listen I don't know who you are but I'm going to call ISP PROVIDER. Because I don't know what's going on and you are not going to scam me.

Me: Ma'am, I am not scamming you. We just spoke. I am remoted into your system right now.

Contact: YOU BETTER NOT BE

Me: Again Jane Doe, I just talked to you. You are the one who let me in. (At this point the entire dept has dropped what they were doing and are listening in and laughing violently. Even my supervisor.)

Contact: Listen, I was working with a woman, but her name was NOT Jane Doe.

Me: No ma'am, my  name is Duff. Your name is Jane Doe, I was just working with you.

Contact: I'm done talking to you. I don't know you are who you say you are, and I'm going to contact ISP PROVIDER. There needs to be some kind of confirmation for this.

Me: Ma'am I can give you the number to Blah Blah tech support. But, calling ISP PROVIDER is not going to help you because this has nothing to do with your internet, this is about your backups.

Contact: No, we are done here. I'm calling ISP PROVIDER and if they say this is a Blah Blah issue then I'll call you back.

Me: Ma'am, again this is not an ISP PROVIDER issue, they cannot help you. This is about your POS issue that we were speaking about earlier.

Contact: I didn't talk to you.

Me: This is Jane Doe correct?

Contact: Yes

Me: From FLORAL SHOP IN OREGON?

Contact: No I don't work for FLORAL SHOP IN OREGON. I work for AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FLORAL SHOP IN OREGON.

Me: What?! I'm sorry ma'am the lady I was speaking with must have given me the wrong contact number.

Contact: I guess she did.

Me: &lt;click&gt;

At this point, I'm completely blown away. I mean this woman's name was Jane Doe. She was a florist in the exact same area code. She was even a member of our floral services, and knew who we were. What are the odds? Right?

Well I tried to track down the owner of the number I was given but it was a cell number. So I had to wait until my correct customer was open and call her back on the store lines. When I finally got back with the correct Jane Doe, I asked her to verify the contact number she had given me. Immediately she goes, ""oh."" She had given me XXX-555-XXXX, when the correct number was XXX-556-XXXX. 

I told her what had happened, and she apologized profusely. I told her that the odds of me getting a woman by the same name, in the same city, in the same type of business, and part of our services was crazy. She asked if we should go buy some lotto tickets and I told her I felt like my luck had ran out for the day. This was my very first call of the day......

Today a user called up and yelled at me because her AD password had expired and it wasn't allowing her to change it to the exact same password. She assured me that my boss had told her at some undetermined point in the past that this was actually a thing. I forwarded her the email I sent when I initially implemented the password policy a year or so ago. Obviously it clearly states that you can't use one of your last 6 passwords.

Anyway, once I informed her that she was mistaken and apologized if she had received any bad information in the past. At this point I was informed in no uncertain terms that I was jeopardizing the security of the organization. The reason? As this user is unable to keep track of a password that rotates on a 6 monthly basis she had to write it on a sticky which she attaches to her screen. As such anyone who sits at her station has access to her account and as her sticky note is a direct result of my password policy I am jeopardizing the security of the organization.

somen00b: Let me look into the matter and call you back because as far as I can tell everything is up and running.  
  
Long story short, I eventually remote into her computer (which she had helpfully left unlocked) and immediately identify the issue based on the helpful error message from Outlook prominently displayed on the screen: Shockingly, email address generally need a domain with something like a .com or .net affixed. I added the .com to the outbound address, sent the email and just like that our email system was magically fixed!

DemWinkles,8,12,1p2kkn,56,"Hey there TFTS,

Today I am going to share my wonderful story from last December involving a printer and a delightful old woman.

**Background**
I perform amateur tech support for the family. No formal certification. Google is my answer to most problems, much like it is for the rest of you.

A friend of the family, of my mother mostly, had just been recently widowed. In conversation she had mentioned how her printer was on its last leg and that her late husband had always meant to get around to fixing it. My mom jumped right on the chance to make use of me and volunteered my services. I was happy to do it.

**Story**
I picked up a fancy new HP Deskjet 1000 J110 series (the $30 ones, those things are little work horses. In my experience the cheaper the printer the less problems it has) after a shift at work. I arrive and have her show me her computer. She points to the desk and I see what was probably an 8 year old computer. Nothing I couldn't handle, I had just retired the family's 10 year old tower a few months prior. We get the old printer out no trouble (also ancient) and put the new one in place. I start up her machine and hit my first roadblock. Her optical drive had some sort of hardware malfunction and would not open when pressing the button. Okie dokes folks I'll just do it through windows. Do it. It works. Awesome. The roadblock was like a pebble. I install the software, get everything connected, and print a dumby document to test it. Do it. It works. Awesome.

She was ecstatic to have a working printer again as she had some pictures from family stored in her email that she was just itching to print off. I was just happy I got the job done and was paid with soup and sandwiches.

TL;DR-Switched out a printer for an older woman. Only true roadblock was that I couldn't eat all the delicious food she paid me in.",I charge an initial fee of one bowl of soup with an hourly rate of 1 sandwich/hour.,68

One asked me a while ago if she could bring her laptop in for me to possibly fix. She said she didn't have any money, someone conned her out of $100 and didn't fix it and her 12 year old needed something for school work.  She brought me a 7 year old machine that was barely repairable. 

I told her I would get her 30gb of pictures off the disk, and give it to her, but the machine was history. She didn't have anywhere to put the files, so I just kept the disk.

Yesterday I told her I would give her an old company laptop that we weren't going to deploy any longer. The caveat was she had to make it disappear and not tell anyone about it. (I got it approved though) I didn't want to start an avalanche of freebie requests, nor did I want someone to say she was treated differently. I put the pictures and files on it, I gave her an old bag, a charger, and sent her on her way.

Today she was telling me that she couldn't get it to connect to wifi. Someone was giving her recommendations but couldn't get it going. I told her when she got home to blah blah blah. ""oh no, it's over here at my desk. Temp1 was helping me"".

Ghost33313,15,25,1p1xb6,113,"This is a short one and has probably happened before but I thought it was worth posting.

*Background:* So at my office there are several tech inept people working here. You know the kind that refuses to even try to learn. On occasion as the IT professional here (a.k.a. the guy with no formal training but actually took the time to learn what it is he uses most of the day) it falls to me to do anything no matter how trivial for these three idiots. Fortunately they try to avoid doing their work so it isn’t as bad as it sounds. 

*Story:*

Scene: I had been stuck in the office 30 minutes longer than normal no big deal, as it was totally necessary. As I am running around wrapping things up I notice a missed call from one the repeat offenders. No message just a missed call I walk by to see if she needed anything but was with a customer. I walk back to my office and say to one of my co-workers if it’s important she would leave a message. 

I put on my coat walk out the door when I hear that dreaded sound. The phone rings again, sigh let’s see what it is.

ME: Hello, did you need something.

Her: Oh! You’re still here!

ME: Well I was on my way out but I can help, what do you need?

Her: My mouse is not working.

I saw the battery light flashing the other day so naturally I respond…

ME: Is there a light flashing on it?

Her: Yes all the time!

ME: The battery is dying. You can go ahead and change it. I know we have plenty of AA batteries. 

Her: Ok thanks so much!

I chuckle to myself as to how silly that was since there is a battery graphic right next to the led on the mouse. No one in this office has ever asked for help with this until now. I walk out my door, turn off the light, then feel pangs of anxiety as the phone rings again. (Quick note: This is because majority of my calls are from idiots while the people who work well (and smart) here either email or come in person since i am usually busy.) I look. It’s her again… really?!

ME: Hello.

Her: There are no batteries on this mouse.

ME: It’s wireless… there has to be.

Her: I am telling you there isn’t.

ME: Flip over the mouse. You should see a switch. Press it and the top will pop off.

Her: There isn’t a switch.

ME: There is a switch.

Her: I don’t see it… Oh! Thankyouverymuch. Click.

deskpalm,4,7,1p1vwi,46,"So the long and short of this tale is to virtually SMH at how some things run where I work.
The IT department were told that we were required to purchase a BES 10 Server so that 5 members of the admin staff could purchase brand new Z10's for no other reason then they are new and so they could show them off....trust me when I say this. Half of the functionality isn't being used.

Also, one other admin staff wanted to to bring his own device and that we were required to have it (the BES 10 server-Not true, but the user is always right, right? )

That brings our total to 6.

Mind you, we currently have BES 5 and (as far as I know) won't stop being supported by Blackberry. We tend to look at any situation as a, if it aint broke, don't fix it kind of ideal.

The new phones were purchased and used immediately before the BES server was purchased, setup and implemented. So they had to be setup through Active Sync---not necessarily a bad idea, but we work in Health Care, so emails have to be pretty much confidential.

Anyway, we spend the money to get this thing, take courses on administration, get it configured, and up and running, and can you guess how long before the first complaint came in?

No less then 2 hours, one of the admin staff complains that it isnt fair that they have to switch between PERSONAL and BUSINESS on a BUSINESS phone.

TL;DR got new BES Server as requested by higher ups,  same higher ups show disdain for PERSONAL/BUSINESS feature on BUSINESS phone.

tobberobbe,48,33,1p1tlu,101,"Hello there, this is the first post here for me, but I hope it will entertain you.

Story starts 3 weeks ago, where my sister launched her company that produces 
canvas paintings with ""motivation pictures"". So I was her tech support, free of 
charge. My job was to make sure the paintings were scanned in by printer, and 
then edit the pictures to the right size, and thereafter remove any spots or 
marks from the drawer. So I sat down and finished all the pictures, and she 
approved it, and we recieved our first batch of paintings, they were spotless, 
she was cheering me on and all that jazz.

Fast forward to yesterday. She tells me i need to redo the paintings, because 
she lost her copies of the finished product..

Yep, she forgot to backup. I was furious at her and talking to her angrily about 
her habits of computer usage. At that point she was at a friends house, so she 
says that I have to edit them again. At that point it was 9PM, where I came home 
from the gym 10 minutes after, so I had to spend way into midnight editing the 
pictures, because her customers were waiting on their order.

Well, couldn't get worse I suppose. I sat down at the computer and she was 
supposed to send the pictures to me. How does she send them? Through facebok...

At that point she had sent me all the pictures somewhere around 5 times through 
facebook, and each time telling her how I won't do anything to them (Facebook 
compresses the image and lowers the pixel count). So I told her to install 
WinRAR, because she already had it in her other laptop, I guessed that she would 
do well, I mean, its just to open the installer and click Install, then OK.
She was silent for around 15 minutes. I asked if it went good. She said no.
 
""It was like a red error box""

I started getting really angry, the clock was 9:30PM and I needed to both do my 
homework, and sleep for school.

After struggling for another 15 minutes I just stopped giving a shit, and told 
her to send me a email, and we'll see if it compresses or not. That worked. 
Okay, so I started up my favorite picture editing software, and went at it. Can 
the problems be fixed? Nope.

First of all, I noticed that some of the file names have different names, it 
should have been Scan 001, Scan 002 and so on, but some was renamed and so on. I 
opened those images and checked them.

Yep, they were compressed. (To give an idea, the scanned image is about 2150 
pixels wide, while the compressed were around 600 pixels wide, and 5MB vs 400kb)
So she just said to skip the faulty images and send her the fixed copies.

So in reflection, what have I learned?

**Me:** Hey Billy this is KroipyBill from that software company. Looks like you're trying to use a multi-instance setup on your server and having a few problems? 

**Billy:** &lt;Rant...I won't go into excessive details as we've heard them all before&gt; I PAID FOR THIS SOFTWARE AND IT'S NOT WORKING AT ALL!!! NONE OF YOUR GUYS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND I ALWAYS HAVE TO CORRECT THEM. 

I come to learn that Billy is a self-proclaimed IT guy, similar to how Hitler was a self-proclaimed leader of Germany for a time. Knowing this, I instantly enter calm the customer down mode. 

______________________________________________________________________________________________

*Calm Customer Down*

**Me:** I'm sorry Billy sounds like it's been some trouble. Let me remote into the server, and we'll see instance wise where we stand. 

**Billy:** NO!

I felt that my feeling of surprise would be similar to being on a train, then seeing the train fall into the ocean some how. Who builds train tracks to the ocean? This was a similar situation. 

**Me:** Oh...okay. Is there an issue with our remote software having trouble on the server? 

**Billy:** NO YOU'LL JUST BREAK EVERYTHING LIKE THE OTHER GUYS HAVE.

I know sometimes mistakes happen among techs in all places of work, but you don't trash techs I work with because your hardware blows.

______________________________________________________________________________________________

*Defense Mode*

**Me:** I apologize you've had trouble, but I can assure you they were trying to help you in troubleshooting and I don't think things are broken. We just need to make sure...

**Billy:** YOU PROBABLY WILL JUST BREAK EVERYTHING LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I BOTHER WITH YOU GUYS YOU'RE THE WORST SUPPORT I'VE EVER USED. 

He keeps opening cases with us most of the time ending happily. And I doubt he has that much stuff for us to mess with anyway. 

______________________________________________________________________________________________

*Ironic Mode*

**Me:** Sir, you've opened several cases with us, in the past you've expressed appreciation for our services as we've helped solve problems for you before. This is no different. 

**Billy:** I DON'T RECALL EVER BEING SATISFIED WITH YOU GUYS SINCE I HAD TO FIX IT MYSELF. SINCE I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING I MIGHT AS WELL FIX IT MYSELF. 

______________________________________________________________________________________________

*The I-No-Longer-Care-About-Your-Situation Mode*

**Me:** Fine, fix it yourself. 

 I believe at this point the same train-in-the-ocean feeling happened to him when I said this. 

**Billy:** But..I...NO IT'S YOUR SOFTWARE!!

**Me:** The problem isn't with our software. You're first off, running out of memory. We tried telling you that, but you ignored us. If you were an IT guy, you wouldn't overlook something as simple as that, nor would you compress your entire C:\ drive thinking it was a good idea. The fact is with your compressed C:\ drive, you're still running out of memory. 

**Billy:** But...

**Me:** Secondly, your server is old. I'd assume to be at least ten years old. Maybe more. We are willing to work with that hardware, but obviously you know what you're doing and it can't possibly be your fault, so you may continue without my help if you wish.

*Silence...* I began to browse Reddit. 

**Billy:** ....how do you want to remote into the server? 

It took a few hours, but he was up and running, and he chilled the hell out. We got him setup the way he wanted, and I recommended even some hardware to consider in the future for his company so he doesn't run into trouble like this. The call was recorded, and I believe it was flagged at one point for review by a supervisor. They reaffirmed that I should use as much tact as possible with customers, but recognize that laying a smack down is sometimes necessary. I mean, that's how Hitler lost right?

**TL;DR** I didn't stab myself with a large shark, and I defeated Hitler at his own game. Billy Hitler's network was up and running in the end.

This is corporate mismanagement at its best. A customer arrives with his precious EMachine. He grossly overvalues his computer because he has upgraded RAM. Calls it his son's 'gaming rig'. He wants to know why it won't play the latest games. I explain that the computer has an integrated graphics card and it's a Pentium Celeron. Single core + almost nonexistent cache + Intel GMA = Overpriced DVD Player. Customer refuses any upgrades and asks that I 'change the registry' to make the computer more powerful. Power on computer and it is infested with spyware. I explain that this is also a contributing factor and that this has to be cleaned before any sort of optimization is to be performed. Customer wants it covered under warranty. This is not warranty work. 

Rage ensues: ""What kind of establishment doesn't support its customers' products?"" I use the car analogy: if you take your bashed up car into the dealership looking for a new bumper for free, they're going to laugh at you. Customer takes this as me patronizing him and wants to talk to the manager. Cue the manager. He enters with his pencil thin mustache and crap-eating grin. He proceeds to throw me under the bus, sells me down the river, and brown noses customer, essentially telling him that I'm not as experienced as the other guys. I was second in charge at the time and first in charge was a sales guy. He sells 350 dollars worth of software repair promising that the PC will play any game on the planet for years to come with no graphics adapter upgrade. Promises one day turnaround. 

Commence spyware removal. This takes DAYS. Our customer calls in twice a day, becoming more aggravated each time. He demands to speak to manager each time as well. We get slapped around by manager each time for over-promising. Computer finally ready. Customer comes in and wants a game installed on the computer to test before he takes it home. The same manager asks someone to bring him a 60 dollar game, crack it open, and install. My co-worker brings back Rainbow Six: Vegas, the most graphically demanding game at the time. Before I can start the PC, customer begins raging about his case being damaged. The check-in document notes a gash on side of the case. I show him this and customer rages again, calling manager to the rescue. Manager goes ""I'm sure it got damaged in the back with all of the guys shuffling things around. I'll pull the tapes and find out who did it."" I know darn well we don't have a camera in the back area. 

We never get to install the game, thankfully.  That would have been simply catastrophic. Several days later, I see the same guy walk out with a Sony Vaio computer and his old computer was sitting in the DEVO pile (to be disposed of by the depot). I presume that the manager swapped out computers in an even trade for a 1500 dollar beast. As a result, I get a firm talking to regarding my elitist attitude and that the customer was justified in his actions. I should have quit then...


**Cash or Credit?**

A crazy cat lady walks in with, you guessed it, an EMachine. Claims to be a savvy ebay lister. She smells like cat pee. OMG she smells like cat pee. Her computer smells like cat pee. She generously brought in her crusty keyboard and mouse. They smell like cat pee. Hairball residue on keyboard as well. NOPE. I'll use my own peripherals, thank you. Customer complains that her credit card swipe doesn't work. I assume she's talking about an online store front. I explain that it's probably a website problem. 

The receipt says computer isn't but a few months old. We power the computer on and the fan sounds like playing cards flapping in bicycle spokes. It blasts 3000rpm of cat pee smell across the bench. Windows boots up. Everything looks to be in order. No spyware, no virus, just the annoying OEM software. I ask her to demonstrate what she's talking about. She browses to someplace other than EBay and tries to buy an item. When it comes to the credit card information, she starts pressing the button to open the CD Tray. 

*No-effing-way.* 

She presses it again and tells me that the light is blinking when it should be solid. Where did she hear that from? Still, though. 

*No-freaking-way.* 

I explain that the CD drive must be stuck and that CD's can't be used to pay for items. She laughs and says she knows that. She just needs her credit card out of the swipe. I surrender to the fact that she put her credit card in the CD tray. I use a paper clip to open the tray. There is an understandable difficulty opening the tray. Finally, I open it and there's the credit card. And another credit card. And an ATM card. AND A CD! The woman thanks me for opening the CD tray and pays for the repair with one of the credit cards.  It's like she didn't realize that, uh, maybe credit cards aren't supposed to be inserted into the computer.  She has to.  Right?  I didn't bother explaining what 99.99 percent of humans should know about a computer. I don't even feel like trying...

MechanicalCrow,23,19,1ozbiv,84,"We have an aging server that hosts a few key databases for our day-to-day operations. It’s run non-stop for 13 years without any serious hiccups, but we recently realized that it was time to make some updates. Yesterday afternoon that changed.  SQL Server started dropping databases and the whole server started slowing down to a crawl. At least one of the drivers in the RAID is toasted and the whole machine is kind of a lifeboat right now. But we were lucky. We have a perfectly good backup of the system from Friday morning and a spare server that we had just bought our software for last Wednesday. The plan was to migrate everything to a new server in the coming weeks. That the existing server failed now is pure coincidence, but we are prepared, if a little behind on our readiness, to migrate.
We had a meeting about the situation to let the office workers know that the system is currently in suspension at the time that the last back-up was created (last Friday morning) and broke the news that there would be some minor reentry of data from that point on. Most were disappointed, but relieved that the time frame was so small. Except one person.

“So I’m going to have to redo everything?” She asked.

“I’m afraid so. We’ll put in the basics so that our system matches up with &lt;external system here&gt; but you’ll have to fill in the details.”

“Why are you doing this to me?” She asked.

“It affects everyone,” we said.

She throws her hands up and then starts crying. “Why are you doing this to me? I’ve lost work!” She said.

“Calm down,” someone said to her.

“No,” she began, “I want to know why they did this to me… to us,” she corrected herself. Everyone stared at her like she was off her rocker and, indeed, she probably was. “I just don’t understand this.” When the meeting ended, she bolted from the room to her office, closed the door, and got on the phone to someone. She came out of her office crying.

She's technically right about the computers being my problem though but I don't have enough power bars / extension cords to offer a temporary solution to this problem. Everything in neatly under the floor I can't have wires everywhere the HSE would lynch me and there's not enough room anywhere in the office to accommodate this many people.

PureJenius,7,18,1oz6ea,68,"Since multiple companies lease/use this product, there were different support processes I needed to accommodate. 

In this particular case, it meant that when a ticket was escalated, I interacted with the tier-1 support staff rather than directly with the client. This filtered out a lot of noise and ensured the customer didn't need to repeat the same information to a bunch of different people. But sometimes it resulted in massive face-palming. 

Cue Mr. Czernobog, who I recalled having opened --and promptly closed-- a ticket when he couldn't log in to the user account he had paid someone to make for him.* 

Well, here's another ticket a month later saying he can't log in.  Tier-1 escalated this problem to me, but didn't provide any information about the user like u/n or e-mail.

-----------

&gt; Me:  Can you get me this guy's e-mail address? 

&gt; Tier-1:  Sure.

/ Waits a few hours for customer to respond

&gt; Tier1: e-mail is diety@slavic-myth.fake

&gt; Me: Hmm. No users in our system with that e-mail. Can you make sure this is the e-mail he uses to log into the system? (common problem: I get the user's personal e-mail, not the one used to create an account)

&gt; Tier1: Sure.

/ Waits a few hours for customer to respond - response the next morning

&gt; Tier1: User confirms that is the e-mail used for the service. 

&gt; Me: That's weird. I looked not only for that e-mail, but for similar e-mail addresses in case there was a typo or incorrect e-mail. What about his username? 

&gt; Tier1: I'll ask. 

/ Waits a few hours for customer to respond

&gt; Tier1:  username is protoslavicdemigod

&gt; Me: I don't see that either, hold on.

** &lt;aside&gt; **

At this point I'm getting worried, since we had recently (and not-so-smoothly) transitioned to a postgres/redis back-end for scalability reasons. I ask some other devs to help me look based on this information, and even pull out archived db dumps to make sure we couldn't find the user pre-migration. 

Nothing. 

** &lt;/aside&gt; **

&gt; Me: Can you have the user tell me what they normally do, step-by-step to log in, including what they type into the username or e-mail field? How long has the user been using this service and when was the last time the user logged in?

travvy87,42,53,1oyzlz,229,"Hey all, as usual long time lurker, first time poster.

I work at a place where we fix everything - computers, networks, servers, photocopiers, printers etc.. I'm currently a photocopier technician however this is when i was working in the computer department.


this tale isn't about a client or a customer, its actually about another tech. 

Now this tech (she's a female) came to us from another tech company who went bust, she's a cool girl and (sort-of) knows her stuff.  

Give her a problem and it'll be fixed - eventually (one time she spent 2 hours on a problem, i gave her a hand and had it fixed in 5 minutes) but she's a sweet girl, willing to learn. However her issue is terminology.   This is where her and I had opposing opinions, she was of the opinion that customers are fairly stupid and want laymans terms (and in turn, confusing the customer) , i'm of the opinion that customers are also fairly stupid and giving them the basic information required (but not anything false)

One time she told a customer that his hard drive had died. Now I would just tell the client that his hard drive is dead and leave it at that, maybe mention that it has bad sectors/whatever.

She told the customer that the laser inside the hard drive had failed and didn't actually have enough power to read the disc.  When I heard this I just facepalmed.... And she wasn't getting the optical drive confused either, she was dead serious about what she was saying.   My first thought was 'great, this guy is going to get a second opinion somewhere else, tell them that we said the laser in the hard drive had failed, then they are going to facepalm as well then tell the customer he was given the incorrect information, making us look like fools)

if you tried to confront her about her sayings (lots more like this, but i've forgotten them all) she would say 'the customers doesn't need anything fancy explained to them, just what they wanna hear'.... i would simply say 'yeah sure, but don't lie to them'

we've had a few weird techs at this place, one tech before my time honestly thought he had a faulty screwdriver and asked another tech for a replacement (he was dead serious)

hope that made sense and sorry if the formatting is abit weird.

mercuricsulfide,39,33,1oyu12,167,"There's so many things I could write about my boss. My job is pretty standard, and our users can be pretty out-there with stuff they say, but my boss just overrules their stupidity every time. Beside the fact she can't shut up and constantly chats bs all day (currently she's talking about something she's seen on Twitter about breast-feeding, apparently to the air in front of her), she's also just not very IT-savvy and yet stops any of the team doing anything IT. It's a clusterfuck. There's no saving this department with her as a boss. I've just learnt to get on with things.

I've worked in my current techie position for six months, and it's a small department of four (with one based out of office) In the office is my deaf colleague; who works solely on the website and makes very bad graphics, and my boss, who likes being the boss. We provide support to 1200 people with software and hardware issues, and also do the general office tasks of creating e-mails, changing passwords and ordering new stock. Did I mention we're also the PR department? It gets busy. 

So, my boss was off for a week. This is the only time anyone dares approach our department with their niggles/queries since my boss will talk down to anyone who dares come to her with any sort of problem. If you didn't send in a request for help through our staff Intranet first, she'll complain. If you did, she'll complain. God help you if you just walked into the office. I suppose this is a good thing as it creates organisation, but the way she goes about this means the department has a very bad reputation and everyone just leaves their PC problems because they can't be bothered with her. So when she's out of office, I suddenly get a lot of calls reporting viruses (yes, we let users install their own software without request - *help me*), incorrect installs, password requests and general ""My PC has something wrong with it pls help"" comments. I'm fine with this, since for some reason my boss hates me leaving the office and grasps at any excuse to keep me at my desk. It makes doing my job as an ICT support techie very, very hard and frustrating. So when she's out of office and I get a call to fix something, I am filled with glee that I can actually go and do something.

I get a request from the office across the corridor to look at one of their computers. It's apparently slow, takes ten minutes to load up and the Internet crashes often. They also requested a new keyboard, as now stickers with letters on have been covering all the buttons for six months and their requests to my boss, as far, have been ignored. I replace the keyboard (why wouldn't you replace the keyboard?? We have twenty extras in the upstairs supply cupboard alone!) and then have a look at the PC.

It's pretty bad. It takes twenty minutes to start up from shut-down and I ended up staring at the customised running horse loading cursor for longer than my mind could handle. I look at how old it is - it's eight years old. Someone is trying to use a PC running multiple programs that is eight years old, and it hasn't been exactly looked after during its run. The program our HR department uses is quite high-demand on even our new laptops, so no wonder this PC was struggling to keep up with it. I look at what it loads up on start-up and there's nothing out of the ordinary there. Their installed programs were minimal and even when I did some clean-ups of unused files and so on, it was just far too slow. No viruses, malware or anything suspicious. After spending an hour (most of that was spent waiting, admittedly) looking at it, I said perhaps it would be best to replace the computer considering the programs they use day-to-day. I really doubt the computer was useful to anyone at this point, but my boss is famously frugal with our (generous) allowance for buying new equipment and it's hard to persuade her to replace *anything*. I'm currently on a five year old laptop that can't be switched off, because it will not switch on again unless you heat it manually if you do let it power down. It's slow for what I do, but it's a step-up from the computer I was given when I started, which commonly blue-screened and was also chock-full of viruses in the beginning. But I digress. 

So they happily put in the request, and my boss (when back from leave) has a look at it and grudgingly admits it's not really up to scratch for office standard anymore. But instead of a new one, why not just use the spare PC in the next room? 

What, the PC discontinued from someone else for similar reasons a few months ago? My boss nods. ""It's been a while, it must be okay by now.""

I literally just stare at her as she says this, and then somehow manage to gather myself to say: ""Well, should I switch it on and see if it's fit to be a replacement?""

My boss shakes her head. ""No, we're busy with your forty minute six month evaluation tomorrow.""

....what? Why can't I look at it now? Or, you know, have a look at it in the other six hours I work tomorrow? *What*?? 

It's been a week and they're still using the same computer as we're ""just so busy in here that we don't have the time to look at it"". I'm currently on Reddit and she's now talking about what TV she watched last night. Every time I bring up going to look at it she glares at me, and says ""But we're doing that evaluation soon.""

here's my fastest, easiest fix I did for a customer.

On a beautiful Monday, I got a ticket to drive about 60 minutes and fix a customer's Internet that he lost last week. As I arrived, I greeted the middle-aged guy and presented myself:

-Good day Mr. [DERP], my name is Tenebralupo. I received a ticket about you lost your Internet connection right?

-Yes, Yes I lost Internet Thursday can you please fix it?

-Sure! I am here for such thing!

We both entered his modern house led me in a narrow corridor to a rather small office room (about 3 feet by 4-5 feet, his desk occupied something like the third of the room, and another third used for a bookshelf, and the remaining is used by both of us. I asked him to log me in his rather slow computer (a really old IBM Laptop that still runs on Win 98). While the computer boot, I decided to check the Router to switch the Antenna port from WAN to LAN to test said equipment. This is where the solution struck me. Indeed, the antenna's power supply was plugged in WAN port, but the cable that lead from the power supply to the antenna was not plugged! I then said:

-Could it happened that you changed your Router?

-Yeah when I called [ISP] last Thursday, they said that my router was problematic for my connection. I changed it last Friday, and then no more Internet, why?

-Well, you unfortunately did not correctly plugged the cables. You see that black cable? It leads to the antenna. If you do not plug it in his power supply, you certainly cannot get Internet since it needs power to work. Wait, you said you changed Friday? do you mind if I check your router config?

-No, no go on I want it to works!

With his permission, I logged in his Router and Found out that he didn't configured it either, he simply thought that by simply plugging every cables in the same position (except the antenna's cable) his Internet would magically work. I then configured it, (because the ISP doesn't use DHCP but PPPoE), ran some tests, warns the ISP and then said to this poor lad that unfortunately he might have to pay ($75/hr) on his next bill the service call for moving me to fix his nonexistent problem and that I cannot charge less than 1 hour.

Here's my most awkward fix
This time I was with my supervisor We got a ticket to fix someone's Internet connection. 

Since I was with my supervisor he did all the job but what we both saw on the Desktop (full on icons) was website bookmarks that leads to 3 different porn site (PornHUB, Xvideos and the third I didn't catch the bookmark name) and the other was just plain hydroponic related stuff, marijuana related stuff, dong stuff, etc. 

Oh did I mention that the house smelled and the humidity was extreme? Yeah everything led to think they grow pot in their basement.

CestMoiIci,35,14,1oxogg,112,"I work for a small ISP, I do mostly over the phone and face to face tech support, and network maintenance, with some sales duties thrown in for good measure.

Recently took a pretty routine call about changing a WiFi password, the customer was concerned that someone else was connecting. No big deals there.

Later the same day, a woman came into my office, tromped up to my desk and explained that she could no longer connect to the internet. I asked for the last name on the account, and lo and behold, it's the account I *just* changed the password on. The account was all connected properly, I could ping their modem, no issues, so I figured that they needed an explanation of how to change a saved WiFi password. Now, before I can disclose any details about the account (amount due, packages, settings, etc.) I am required to confirm who the customer is.

So, following procedure, I asked for the accounts billing address, the one she gave me didn't match, so I went to the next thing and asked for her ID, checked, this woman isn't the account holder! Well that's odd. Looked further, the account doesn't have any other authorized users at all.

After asking more about what she was doing, and being berated for not telling her the new password, I discovered she had set up a wireless repeater in her house, and had been using her neighbor on the other side of the blocks internet (the actual account holder) as the access point for that. Apparently without the account holders permission.

I really don't understand why she thought she would get help from the service provider, when she knows she isn't a subscriber.","I suppose I could tell you your password, if you had one.",126
SGG,19,11,1oxk64,72,"Just a quick story from yesterday.

User calls up complaining that the wireless is down because they cannot get on the network with their iPad.

Now, we had a switch fail a few weeks ago, and the switch covering the area the user was in is the same age, so I was concerned that perhaps this one had sent its last packet as well. I pull up our AP monitoring tool (Aruba stuff is rather nice), and it showed all the AP's as up, and the AP right next to this user with 3 others connected. The iPads here love to just stop working, we're not sure why, but think it has something to do with auto proxy settings and DHCP option 252, iPads just seem to ignore it every now and then, it's a simple fix, just forget and re-join the network, then make sure the iPads are using auto proxy settings again.

I tell the user this, and am immediately told ""No that's not the problem my iPad is fine, the wireless is down get it fixed"".

So I go over to the other side of the building, forget and re-join to the wireless on the iPad, and problem solved.

So, like most ISPs, we have a spam filter installed server-side on the ISP mail server. Customer's have the ability to log in to this service and customize it, adding to the black/white list and adjusting the frequency they receive the ""Quarantine Report."" 

The quarantine report is just 1 single email with a list of all blocked email, with an option for the customer to release any non-spam messages that may have been erroneously blocked. 

Today I got a call from an angry woman regarding her quarantine.. 

Essentially, she finds it very upsetting and offensive that she is getting reports in her inbox that are talking about ""enlarging male genitals"" and other ""smut"" every day. She was sure to remind me throughout the call that she is a CHRISTIAN Woman, and that this kind of thing is NOT appropriate from a company. 

I offered to remove the quarantine reporting service, so that these reports would no longer show up for her, but she did not accept this as a solution because she wants to review them to be sure that there isn't anything that needs to be released from it. 


It came down to an impossible call. A call with no solution, other than for me to control the nature of the spam she is receiving. 

I think she felt good inside, yelling at me about her superior morals. Personally, I wanted to inform her of two more possible solutions: 

1) Just stay off the internet and other public forums where her closed world-view may be threatened or 

2) Pray about it and have Jesus become her new spam filter. 

Of course I couldn't say this, and simply repeated that I could stop the reports from coming, but that I can't control who is spamming and what they are spamming about. 

The call ended with her saying ""Thanks for nothing"" and then hanging up.

rolemartyr-x,220,303,1ox1v3,1170,"Basic Help Desk setting, we take care of AD account lockouts and whatnot, along with pretty much everything else.  A tool was passed down to me that allows you to check a person's AD account, see when they last entered a bad password, the lockout state, the last time the person changed their password, etc.  It's not exactly on the list of approved programs to use, but it definitely comes in handy.  

We often have people locked out of their accounts who INSIST that they are entering their password correctly.  Most often, this occurs when they are setting up email on their smartphone, and they fat-finger the password, but don't realize it.  The passwords are the same passwords users use to log into their web apps.

I receive a call one day from a lady who is trying to set up her email on her phone.  She keeps receiving an error that her username or password is incorrect.  I check her account, and it is indeed locked out.  I unlock it and ask her to try entering the password again, as it won't accept it if she is locked out.  She enters the password again and receives the same error.  I check my nifty little account lockout tool and see it registered a bad password less than 30 seconds ago.  I don't like to give away that I can see my users are idiots, especially since the program is supposed to stay on the DL, so I just ask her to try one more time.  She gives me an earful about how she's *NOT* stupid and that she can obviously enter her password correctly, but complies.  Same error.

At this point she's furious and telling me that it's my fault she has to change her password every 90 days and she always has this problem.  I can hear the clicking of her iPhone as she types in her password each time, and I can tell she's typing fairly quickly.  I ask her to slow down her typing to ensure she's not pressing the wrong button.  Another earful and another quickly-typed wrong password.  She says something about how this should work since she can get to her web apps and it's our fault it doesn't work on her phone.  I get an idea.  I ask her to go to her computer and try to log in to her web app, but before she is able to, I go to the web app, type in her username, and type in my personal password 3 times, intentionally locking her out of her account.  She tries to log in to the web app, and, of course, cannot get in.  

Now she has the revelation that maybe she *is* typing it incorrectly.  I quickly unlock her account and suggest she tries logging in to the web app again, typing slowly and carefully.  Somewhat mockingly, she slowly punches each key while saying it out loud to **MAKE SURE** I can hear her typing slowly.  Magically, she is able to log in.  Now I ask her to do the same thing on her phone, since we know she has the right password.  She types it in slowly on her phone and *gasp* IT WORKS!

At least, I assume it does.  She hung up on me with a *click* that sounded a lot like shame.

This week is this month's Interim Session for my state's govt., and my division is the (long acronym that basically means IT dudes) for the House of Representatives and about 6 other state departments.  Anyways this week is basically a lot of boring meetings and politicians making nice for the press.  I was on my way to set up a laptop/projector/screen for one of those committee meetings this morning and smelled smoke as I got closer and closer to the elevator.  My coworker looked at me and asked ""Do you smell smoke?  Is something on fire?""


I was confused, but we rounded the corner, and see a Capital Cop calling for 911 over his radio and 2 capital servicemen banging open the door with smoke pouring out from the cracks in it.  Note - this door is right next to the central elevators for the entire building.  


We stand there confused because the fire alarm (right next to the door) isn't going off.  We ask the cop if we ought to go ahead and evacuate before the alarm goes off.  He looks at us and says ""Don't bother.  Fires are not a cause to evacuate.""


Turns out that the generator for the elevators caught fire.  It was put out quickly, and currently repairs are being done.  But still, what a wonderful way to start out the week.

rolemartyr-x,56,32,1owszh,180,"I work at a Help Desk that provides (mostly remote) support to corporate employees and independent sales reps from around the country.  The sales reps can take orders in a number of ways, but they must all be entered through a web app that only runs correctly in Google Chrome.  However, one sales rep from southern California, who has his own large collection of tinfoil hats, doesn't necessarily agree with the decision to run things through Chrome.


I had heard stories about this particular sales rep (SR) before, but, being new to the company, I had not had the *pleasure* of working with him yet.  One day, I get a call from SR, saying his computer is doing strange things and he thinks he has an infection.


I ask him if he can go to our support site so I can get connected to his computer remotely.  He does so, I get connected, start a virus scan, and tell him that I will stay remoted onto his computer to work, while letting him get off the phone to do some other things. He agrees and we hang up, with the promise that I'll reach out to him if I need him for anything.


So the virus scan runs for a long time, and about halfway through, I get tired of waiting for it, so I start looking through  his program list to uninstall any junk programs, toolbars, etc.  Pretty standard practice for our help desk.


All of a sudden, someone else on the desk calls out to me that the rep is on the phone asking for me.  Strange, but I told the analyst he could transfer SR over.


This is the conversation that ensued:


**SR:** rolemartyr-x, I checked on the virus scan and I noticed that my computer was moving on its own!  I think it's been hijacked!
(This rep has been with the company for a long time and has had experience with the remote software.  Not sure why he was confused)


**rolemartyr-x**:  No, SR, that's just me using the remote software.  I'm uninstalling junk programs like those toolbars and antivirus scans that you're seeing popups for.


**SR**: Oh, okay.  Could you be sure to remove all those Google programs installed?


**rolemartyr-x**:  Sure, SR, I'd be happy to uninstall all of the programs you don't need.  You can watch to make sure I get rid of everything you don't want.


**SR**: (Watching me uninstall programs, get to the ""G""s and uninstall Chrome toolbar but don't uninstall Chrome) rolemartyr-x, why didn't you uninstall Google Chrome? I asked you to uninstall all the Google programs.


**rolemartyr-x**: Well, SR, you need Chrome to run your online applications.  You have to use Chrome to enter your customers' orders.


**SR**: Oh yeah.  Well you should let your team know that they're dumb for using Google Chrome for secure transactions.


**rolemartyr-x**: I can let them know what you think, SR.  Is there a reason I can give them?


**SR**: Well, obviously because Google steals all the customers' information and sells it to the NSA!


**rolemartyr-x**: (Rolling my eyes) Do you have any suggestions for which web browser we should be using?


**SR**: Internet Explorer because it's not connected to any big corporations that want your information!

Of course Mr. Magoo was running Windows XP and IE8. Since our product only officially supported IE9+ (and grudgingly at that), I encouraged Mr. Magoo to upgrade or switch to FF or Chrome at every turn.

SerBeardian,90,155,1owddm,522,"Today I had a lovely win, so I wanted to share it with you all. Sorry for the long post.

Preface: I work Frontline Support for the small/medium business services of a major Australian ISP. We deal with both internet and email/domain issues (for domains hosted by us) as well as general computer issues directly related to internet access.

The Story: I get a call this morning from a dealer (Basically a franchise-style sales/support for our services) who has this client that has recently set up his emails with our domain and is not able to send any mail.

I had just written up an ""Ultimate Guide to Domains and Emails"" for our team to use, and am pretty savvy when it comes to domains, so I think ""This will be easy enough"" and run through the basics:

Is the domain with us? Check. Are the Registrar/Name Servers/MX records acceptable? Check. No glaring problems with the Domain? Check. Mailbox set up and working on the Mail Server? Check.

Everything checks out, I tell the dealer to connect the customer through.

...1 minute later, the call drops. I'm weighing up whether to try and contact the customer direct or take a different call. I decide service is a better choice and start hitting the contact numbers on the account.

3rd attempt I get through. Let's call the customer JG. Older gent in his early 70s. I introduce myself and explain that I was supposed to be helping him out but the call dropped with the dealer. He seems friendly enough but in a rush. I ask him if he's ok with me just remoting into the computer and setting it up for him. He gives the ok and I prep it from my end.

I get him to go to www.logmein123.com, no dice. Try again, nothing. I send him an email direct link and it doesn't come through right away. 

At this stage he's pretty upset since he's been having problems for a month and we're roadblocking from go. He's gotta make a call overseas in 5 minutes and can't hang around.

I try and get him to call me back when he's done since our queue is fairly full right now, but he's having none of it and wants a call back in 20 minutes. I say fine, I might not be able to in 20 minutes, but I'll call back same day.

2 standard calls and an hour later, the queue is low enough to warrant an outbound call. I hit up his number and get through right away (Btw? This guy picks up the phone like he can hear me dialling...).

He's feeling a bit better since he got his call through ok, so we get started. Try the website, no luck getting through. Send him 2 emails, since the first one arrived, but they're not going through.

Finally, he mentions that he had some DNS problems the other day. I think he's probably still having them, considering some pages do load after a while, but others don't.

Windows+R

cmd

ipconfig /all

DNS servers are something strange, not ours.

We joke about what they might be and I figure we can just use Google. (since I can never rememeber the IPs of our DNS servers...)

Win+R

ncpa.cpl

Network interfaces

Right click&gt;properties&gt;doubleclick TCP/IP v4.

IP and DNS are auto, so no real idea where the others are coming from.

I get him to set the primary DNS to 8.8.8.8 and the secondary to the old primary (in case it's actually important).

Pages load almost instantly, computer works great now. Huzzah! More jokes.

About an hour so far and we finally get to logmein and I get him to download the file.

Bam. Anti-virused. Fuck Norton.

Takes 15 minutes to get around Norton and get logmein downloaded and working. Finally, I'm in and in control. Let's take a look at Outlook.

Two emails. One with another ISP. One with us.

Hit send/recieve. SMTP server is asking for user/pass. Ok, that's strange. Our smtp server doesn't needs a user/pass.

Check settings, all correct. Correct user/pass, correct mail servers, correct everything. Problem doesn't go away.

Recreate mailbox, fiddle with every setting I can think of.

JG needs to have lunch. Makes sense since we've been at it for about 2 hours now. Figure, may as well call Domain Admin while he does, check to make sure the domain is OK.

Call them, they agree it's a weird situation but we can't make heads or tails of it.

Get back to JG and let him finish his lunch while I poke and prod the computer. He's done in a few minutes, and we get back to general chit-chat while I fiddle with it. Coming up on 3 hours and I'm finishing in 15 minutes.

Now, thoughout this whole time, the connection kept dropping out, every few minutes. I mention this and JG drops the bombshell that broke the case: His previous ISP was a wireless one, using a dish/antenna on the roof and he got ADSL because it kept dropping out a lot, especially bad weather.

No...

No way it's that simple.

www.ipchicken.com.

IP does not match his static IP with us.

He's still using his old bloody ISP service!

Copy SMTP from his other ISP email.

Paste into SMTP for our email.

Done and freaking DONE.

Everything works. Emails send ok. Emails receive ok.

We laugh it off.

I get him to send an email to the dealer to get him switched across to our equipment and change the SMTPs back.

Support complete.

Bonus round!

He asks me how to renew the license for Norton, since he doesn't like using his credit card online.

I recommend using a free AV instead and get him to ask the dealer or his It support, since we can't recommend any specific AV programs.

JG: ""Aw come on, nobody will know.""

Me: ""Well, you know, the calls are recorded and all.""

JG: (laughs) ""Well alright, I'll just get (dealer) to recommend one, but if anyone's listening, I'd like to say you're absolutely brilliant.""

Me: ""Wellll...my manager is sitting right over there, how about you tell him yourself?""

JG: ""Sure! Why not?""

MG: ""Cool! I'll get him in a sec!""

Grab my Team Leader (Who's a pretty cool guy.) for a commendation.

He comes over, starts chatting with JG and taking down notes...and then they start talking about AFL and what teams they support.

Turns out, JG used to play for my TL's favourite teams growing up and was pretty much his childhood hero. My TL is speechless (and he's always got something to say.) and stammering over the stunned realisation that he's talking to one of his heroes.

After wrapping up the call, I log off and begin signing out to head home, pleased with my double win.

TL;DR: Spend 3 hours fixing an email problem with a simple but hidden cause. Get TL for commendation. Customer is TL's childhood hero. ++Brownie points.

Smith6612,16,53,1ovjrb,232,"So here's another story which happened a few years ago, and I'd figure all of you would enjoy.

In the company I work for, we have a team of developers who work to create applications which are used both internally and externally. One of these applications, which was under heavy development for months, happened to be an automation toolset which was designed to replace an older, more archaic system that would break if you even tried to look at it funny and was starting to no longer fit the company's needs. This new automation system, like the system it was replacing, tied into Microsoft Exchange to drive one of it's automation tasks.

Now, as these are developers, I provide a self-service solution to them for development. They can get on-demand virtualized dev environments from a dedicated cluster of servers in our datacenter, with dedicated network capacity (segregated from the rest of the network, excluding services such as subversion which are needed for dev work), and Internet access after submitting a ticket requesting such ability. Being self-service, the virtualized environments can be reloaded to a clean image of their choice, can be restarted, and scaled at any time as they need. As a benefit to being virtualized, if a host goes down for any reason, the developers can continue their work, while the downed host is being brought back online (yay for fault tolerance!).

So with that said, the developers should have everything they need to work on and test every bit of every program they work on without having to bother any Helpdesk personnel or a SysAdmin. Before this development environment existed, the developers were often creating and testing their programs locally on their machines. We have policies on how development work must be performed, and one of which includes running all dev code in the test environment until it is ready for production. This of course, is where the story starts.

It's a Friday evening, and I'm preparing to ""disappear"" from the daily torment of ""Can you fix my computer?"" or ""Why is the Internet slow?!"" or ""Where is my file!!!!"" by taking a week-long vacation to just get out of the office. I check my e-mail for anything important, check over our system monitoring to see if any networked hosts and devices were in alarm, lock my workstation and desk, and proceed to walk out the door. Suddenly, the phone rings, a rarity for the time of day. It's the Helpdesk.

""Hey Smith, we've received a few calls and tickets in from some users who are reporting problems with their e-mail in the past half half. Most of these users are not able to synchronize their mailbox. One user reported their mail client started crashing. We were able to resolve that problem, but their mailbox will not synchronize. The problem appears to be with the Exchange servers. Would you be able to check this one out?""

I agree, since Exchange being down is, in other words, the end of time as we know it. After all, I could have overlooked something before leaving for the day. I ask a few questions about the problem that was at hand, making sure the helpdesk followed all troubleshooting procedures before escalating the problem to me, and received a list of the users. I agree to take a look at the issue based on the answers I received back. Knowing that many of these users were sharing common servers and a common Exchange store, I proceed to take a look at the problem. Servers up? Yes. Network running properly? Yes. How about loads? Oh...

The load on one of the CASs was through the roof. High network utilization, high CPU usage. The database store hosts were showing higher than normal I/O usage and network utilization. We have a legitimate problem! I dive into the problem deeper at this point. A few commands later in PowerShell and a bit of cross-referencing some network logs, I can see that all but one user on the affected Exchange cluster have left for the day and their mailboxes are dormant. One user was still logged in, and problems were ongoing. I check their mailbox statistics, and the monster appears from tall grass.

The user's mailbox was growing, and it was growing quickly, in just one folder. The Deleted Items folder. It was at 700GB. Seeing this, I quickly lock down the mailbox and place it into a read-only mode. The server loads drop, and network usage settles back to normal levels. An alarm finally comes through showing high load on the affected hosts, and security warnings start to arrive about ""Access Denied"" for the affected mailbox.

A few minutes later, I'm on the phone with the user whose mailbox I shut down. They are a developer. As it turns out, they were testing some new code for the new automation system outside of the development environment I provide for them (where they have their own mail environment, too!), and for testing purposes, tied their own Exchange account into the program. While asking them why they were testing software outside of a dev environment, I take a peak at their Deleted Items folder, and then delivered the news on what they did. As it turns out, the program they were testing was recursively duplicating their deleted items folder, caught in a loop, and grew the mailbox at an exponential rate. An unexpected feature!

Reminding the user of our development policy, I get to work on cleaning up the mess, and the user works on getting their program shut down and back into the dev environment. Given that I care for my users, and given a restore from backup would have resulted in hours of downtime for other users, I elect to create a quick Powershell script that will clean up the duplicated items and leave one copy of each message in their mailbox, which they agree to. I informed the user that they will need to have the helpdesk repair their mail client after this incident, and send the ticket back off to the Helpdesk stating the Exchange problem was resolved. A few hours later, the script completes. The user's mailbox went from 700GB down to a comfortable 500MB, with not a single message missing. I leave the office, ready for a vacation, amazed at the fact that a mailbox hit 700GB. The helpdesk come the next working week was able to get the user up and running again with their e-mail client, and all was well with the world.

Some notes to wrap the story up. Why wasn't a mailbox quota enforced for this user, which would have stopped this mess? Well, when upper management crashes down on you saying limiting a mailbox's size stops productivity, no amount of explaining is going to get them to turn back on their demands for unlimited storage. So everyone gets unlimited. As a bonus, I do get to bug them for more money when it comes time to beef storage up, reminding them of their poor choices :)

At the isp I work for, it is mostly for places in the mountains and areas that don't service internet normally. Generally an older generation. Every day, a few times a day, this is the conversation:



Thank you for calling so and so tech support, how can I help you?



Yeah, I need to talk to tech support.



This is tech support, what seems to be the problem?

Gazzy7890,9,31,1ougjr,97,"So, I'm a long time lurker and decided to post something that had happened to me a few months back.

Back story: I'm in high school and quite technologically literate; I taught myself how to fix computers and to code. I tend to help my friends out quite a bit when it comes to broken computers and phones and I usually help them fix their problem.

Story: Now, one day at school, I was approached by a friend, were just going to call him Bob, about his computer. He described his computer's problems to me, and I recognized his predicament to be a hard drive issue. I told him his hard drive was probably failing and he should get a new one before he loses all his data. He thanked me for my help and I walked away.

The next day, Bob came up to me, and told he that he talked to his dad about his computer problem and told him what I had recommended. His dad then said, ""Your friend doesn't know what he's talking about. He probably doesn't know a thing about computers. We're going to take it to a professional to have it looked at."" I was quite offended, just because I'm young and in high school doesn't mean I'm computer illiterate. I brushed it off though; I had other things to worry about.

About a week later, Bob came up to me again. He told me that his dad had sent the computer to a 'professional' repair shop. The problem, like I said, turned out to be the hard drive. He had it replaced and his computer worked fine.

CMahaff,65,53,1ou8c7,277,"Backstory: Around 2-3 years ago we got Grandma a computer. She was a little unsure about it at the time, but I worked with her and within a few months she could write emails and use Skype without issue. Not bad considering she's never even used a typewriter, and would struggle to change the TV input to play a DVD.


Of course, there has been a constant fight between me and other family members over control of the PC, which they just love to install stuff on. They also got her a Facebook which is now the sight of endless old-people drama. And let's not forget when her first computer died, my Uncle did not listen to me and instead bought her a brand new Windows 8 laptop, which neither of them knew how to use (he's almost as bad as she is with this stuff, but doesn't *think* he is). Thankfully within a few weeks of visits, I had everything back where it was. Teamviewer for remote support, Dropbox for all the pictures, email (without sending her into the god-awful touch interface), the works.



Fast-forward to the present, and Grandma's internet is not working. She may have spent the first 80 years of her life without it, but now she *needs* it. She does know how to reset her router though, so she heads downstairs to do that. No effect. Comcast is most likely down in her area, but Grandma doesn't quite grasp the concept of ""outages"". I still don't know how she was able to do what she does next, but somehow **she manages to activate system restore and return to the point right after we brought the computer home**.

I was busy bulk reimaging computers in preparation for staff replacement machines when the bat line lit up, I picked up, asked what the issue was, and ran off to find out why the podium machine would not turn on. As I egressed from the building I took notice of an electrician departing at the same time. We talked for a little while as we both walked to the same building, he stepped off into the electric closet and I walked into the classroom. 

I asked the professor to show me to the computer. As we walked up to it he stated, ""It  won't turn on I checked the power button and made sure the surge protector switch was switched on."" I looked at him, then just gave the computer the stink eye. The computer finally relented under my stern gaze and turned back on. The classroom started mumbling, small outbursts of ""What the.."", ""How the fuck?"" among others as the students exclaimed their surprise. I walked from the room to applause from the students.

(Backstory, we gave him a 1GB upgrade to test out because he was complaing of lag. I sent him a reply saying the trial was over. This ensued after)

&gt;rootedchrome: I have hope you enjoyed your trial of 6GB. Did you notice an improvement? Would you like me to send an invoice over to you for the upgrade? The cost for the rest of this billing period would be $5.16

&gt;Client: Hello i wanted to know if i can upgrade my server today for 6GB but can i cancel it like in the last day? like downgrade back to 5GB then the next day can i upgrade back for 5$ agian idk i just feel i dont waste that much money like this but is it the same thing?

&gt;rootedchrome: The $5.16 is the prorated cost. It is found by taken the price of the 6GB and subtracting the price you already paid for the 5GB. You then take that number and divide it by how many days are left in your cycle. It will be a lot more than $5.16 the first day of your cycle since you are 10 days in now. 

&gt;Client: so how much will it be? if i keep doing that can u give me a exmiple

&gt;rootedchrome: On the first day of your cycle, it will be $8. Subtract 25 cents as the days go on. 

&gt;Client: i did 8 Subtract 25 im going into negative number like -17 the frist try i did it

&gt;rootedchrome (facepalming at this point): I said 25 cents, which would be .25 in a calculator....

macpcmax,34,43,1oss89,159,"Helloha!

I do Tech Support for a small office in the midst of my lovely hometime. Ironically enough, said office is owned by my mother, who is not really tech-savvy (not to insult you mom).

Anyways, she is out a lot doing work outside the office, so her employees like calling me for various reasons. I have a separate phone line I use just for the office and people I don't talk to regularly, so they end up calling that phone most of the time.

So it turns out that whilst I was in school the other day, they decide to call the phone about 10 times. This is concerning the ""Black Computer"".

Which
 a) is not a computer; it's a Dell Flatpanel hooked up to a PowerMac G5
 b) all the computers at the office have an asset Tag and a name sticker with a simple name

So anyways, I get to my mother's office after school and look at the computer. Not much going on. It's seven years old and it's just there for Google.

Here's the problem. My mom has an *awesome* employee who decided he should look for the password list, to which only one of the secretaries  and me have access. He persuades her to give him the list, which contains the passwords for the local admins, which isn't really a biggy since it won't mess up open directory if they mess up the computers at the office. (Yep open directory, iMacs, VirtualBox and pGina are some of my best friends since my mother hates windows)

So apparently they got a new printer (which I was not told about) and immediately ditched the old one. They took it out of the box and started setting up. The printer worked with web print, by submitting the documents, but hey? Why not mess up that PowerMac?

So this fabulous employee took said passwords and got himself to work, and unlocked the PowerMac, which set him loose from all the usual restrictions he's put under. He decided that it would be best to install the Intel Mac Drivers on this beautiful PowerPC Mac. Logic, right?

Turns out that doesn't work. Hm. Maybe fiddle around in the settings? Remove the PowerMac from Open Directory? BINGO! Check. Remove all the special users that are set up to run diagnostic software? Check. Remove all software that doesn't seem like it belonged there (anti-virus, Office 2004, iPhoto, Aperture and iWork)? Check.

Yep, I got to the computer. Now, the reason for the call was, as it turned out, the printer drivers wouldn't install and the computer would no longer allow the other users' accounts to log on. Yay!

And, because this is the only PPC system in the office, I didn't create a network boot. YAYYYYYY!!!!!

Now, where did I fail?
* I left too many ways into the system. Got rid of that problem by no longer allowing access to the list unless you're called **macpcmax**
* The computer is over-aged and unsafe.
* I had an employee access a company computer which he was not supposed to access

What did I learn?
* Remove all password lists
* Take away as MANY PERMISSIONS AS POSSIBLE
* Make a NetBoot copy of the OS X Install Disc for Leopard
* That the law in my country does not allow personal computers to be used in the workplace and vice-versa unless you have them in an isolated environment where files cannot be exchanged with the personal computer; Citrix Remote Sessions, TeamViewer or good old RDP are your friends.

On this particular day, I opened my lunch bag to find a hot pink Post-It note that simply said ""I Love You"". I took the post-It and stuck it to the bottom of my monitor.

As soon as I started here, I saw a lot of really stupid things going on. The first was that my boss had a folder for product sheets on EVERY computer in the office. His PC's desktop looked like someone took the recycling bin and dumped the entire thing on it.

There were five folders for the same exact thing, duplicate shortcuts for programs, any time he couldn't find something in 10 seconds, he started up a new version of it.

How did he manage to start a new version of the same folder every single time he lost it?

He has emailed himself a copy of every single document he might ever want. Dozens of emails, megabytes upon megabytes of files.

**Technical Amnesia**

Relating to the story above, I decided it was unacceptable to have the same folders across a dozen computers, so I started setting up a shared folder with all of the files. Because my boss has no concept of ""save as,"" I set two of them up. One folder with all of the things he frequently needed to print or email to people, allowing full access so he can move new files into it as he sees fit. The other was a read-only folder for templates and other things I created that should have copies made of them before editing.

I've tried to explain to him why it's set up this way. It goes in one ear and out the other, and the next time it becomes a problem for him, I have to do it again. I've given up.

**Boss:** WHY CAN'T I EDIT THIS PURCHASE ORDER?

**how_it_do:** Because that shared folder is read-only since those are template documents. You're supposed to save a copy of them to your computer before you work on them.

oniiesu,182,244,1opw8s,960,"Note: I originally posted this as a reply to an askreddit thread when I realized it would probably be a good entry for here. I'd like to note that I was not a tech when this story occurred, I simply worked on computers as a hobby. 

Without further ado:


Working at one of my first jobs, I was quickly identified as a computer geek because I would bring in my laptop, disconnect the fax machine, and used the line to play GunBound during my downtime (at the times we operated, all other offices were closed and we never got faxes from outside sources). Because of this every time something went wrong with a computer, I was asked if I could take a look at it, and usually I could fix it or identify what was wrong for our techs to fix it. Boss loved me for this, as I saved her a lot of money via the techs.

One day another coworker comes in and asks if I could look at her PC at home, as it keeps randomly shutting down and she thought ""maybe it's a virus?"" I agree to take a look and head to her house. The PC would boot fine and everything seemed to be going normally. I noticed Kazzaa and Limewire on their desktop and thought ""Yep, probably virus"" and run a virus scan. PC unexpectedly switches off during the scan, no warning, no bluescreen, just off.

Thinking it was the power supply, I told my co-worker as such and asked if I could take the tower home to try and see if I could find the hardware issue and find a replacement in my spare parts. She agrees and I take it home. I open up the case and inside is caked with dust, not unexpected, but I believed I had my culprit right there. I pulled out the hdd and stuck it in a spare PC, figuring I could have it do the virus scan while I worked on the hardware issue. I took the case outside and dusted it with cans of duster, took 2 full cans if I recall correctly. I then start visually inspecting the psu for a blown fuse (the model was that old) or capacitor. I find nothing, I even sniffed around the unit for that familiar ""ozone"" smell of fried electronics, not a damn thing.

Stumped, I head back inside to find the virus scan completed. I check the results: over 100 infected files removed, DAMN! I also noticed that several files were noted as infected but the scanner could not remove them, I check the directory and they're in the kazzaa downloads folder. No problem, I'll remove them manually.

The folder was PACKED with bestiality videos, most involving pigs. over 80% of the hard drive's used space was occupied by these videos, all with graphic and disgusting thumbnails/titles. I was mortified. Nothing to do but nuke the entire directory from orbit. I removed both Kazzaa and Limewire, as well as all of their downloaded files (I didn't even check the Limewire directory, I didn't want to know).

Finished cleaning their registry of the last few items the scan couldn't catch, re-scanned and the HDD was clean, or at least as clean as it was ever gonna be. Removed the HDD from my spare PC and as I went to put it back in the original, I noticed the actual problem: under all that dust the IDE cable had been badly crimped, somehow exposing a bit of wire that was managing to ground out to the PC case. Replaced the IDE cable and no more rebooting problems.

I returned the PC to my coworker and informed her that the problem was fixed. She paid me and said ""I knew I was right to ask you, my husband said I was stupid to trust you and that you wouldn't be able to fix it! He was SOOO nervous!""

I had no idea who was doing what or how much they knew about each other so I simply said ""Oh I think he might have been nervous about the peer-to-peer software, a lot of people use that to download illegal files as well as legal stuff.

I work for a company that does tech support for a very large company, we'll call it Tomato.

So I was helping this girl with her Tomato phone with something or another.  One of the steps during this was to restore the software on her phone, which also updates to the latest version.  As we're waiting for this to finish, this lovely interaction happened:


**Her**: ""So is it true that this new software will shut off the phone if it senses liquid so it won't break?""

**Me**: *mute* ""HAHAHA"" *Trying to keep composure* ""No, that was actually something that someone released on the internet to maliciously get people to break their phones.""

**Her**: ""Really?  But I thought I saw a Tomato advertisement that said that.""

**Me**: ""Yeah, I saw that too, it wasn't something that was made by Tomato.""

**Her**: *not letting it go* ""No, but it was an actual Tomato commercial on TV where a girl is using her Tomato phone while standing in the ocean.""

pordzio,57,103,1op9ze,353,"A quick story. After reading many stories here I should have known better, than do this, but here goes:

One lazy Saturday my aunt calls me up:

(A)unt: ""Hey, pordzio. Can you come up and do something with my computer? It's running slow again"" (Side note: her computer is a ~2004 Toshiba Satellite)

I arrive at her home and with her man watching me I get on with formatting the hard drive and reinstalling windows xp. After installations (drivers, copy data back etc.) I check if the basics are working (play some sounds, browse some web etc.). We both see it's working ok and leave it at that. I collect 20$ (family rates and what not).

Cue sunday afternoon:

(A): ""pordzio, the computer is not working! Since yesterday there is no internet!!!!. You broke the computer!!!!""  
(M): ""Calm down! Tell me what's happening""  
(A): ""Yesterday after you left it stopped working! It's hanging and after a few minutes there is no internet!!!   Nothing is working!!!! And you took money for it!!!!""  
(M): ""Well, that is a problem. Want me to come down and see what's happening and fix it?""  
(A): ""NO! We will take it to a professional shop and they will do it right!""

On Wednesday I was working late and my mum took advantage used it to catch up with my grandparents and Aunt (the live in neighbouring apartments).

(Mum): ""pordzio, Aunt is bitching about You, how you took the money and broke her computer. I would like you to come and fix it.""  
(M): ""Mum, I spoke with A on Sunday and then she said, that she will take the computer to a professional shop and didn't want me to come and fix it""  
(Mum): ""Looks, like she changed her mind""

That evening:
I come up to A, turn the computer on (A is constantly bitching), connect it to her WiFi, open windows's connection status window, ping -t and browse internet - all is working. After a few minutes - connection speed is dropping. After a few seconds connection dies. So on to diagnostics. I turn my phone into a mobile Access Point and connect the computer to it. Same symptoms. 

Google search reveals, that is a driver issue. After installing the driver everything is working even better, than before reformatting the HDD.

(M): ""A, it was driver issue. Even a professional shop might have missed that. I installed a good driver. Quick and simple fix.""  
(A): ""But it was working before you started working on it! Why did you remove thie driver!""  
(M): ""O_o I installed the drivers, that were provided with the computer. Didn't even cross my mind, that these drivers could be broken""  
(A): ""Why didn't you copy the old drivers!?""  
(M): ""A, copying a driver from a running system and without knowing it will be needed is next to impossible""  

And with that, I leave.

The next day i hear from mum: 

(Mum): ""A called me. Started bitching how you couldn't fix her computer the first time. I snapped at her: pordzio wanted to come to you on Sunday. What was your reply? NO. A went silent""

justshootmealready,40,24,1ooyyt,135,"Hi Guys, I just stumbled upon this treasure of tech stories and wanted to share one of my own.

**Background:**
I'm the only ""IT guy"" in this company, I manage 100+ computers, a few servers, a bunch of software and the local networks.

**The Story:**
In the middle of opening a new branch, being the only person responsible for everything, I was busy as f*ck, then I get a call at 4 pm from my boss about a computer that needs ""fixing"", backing up and transferred somewhere 100KM (60 miles) away tomorrow morning. (I don't mind the drive, but being on the road for 2 hours, there is alot of shit to deal with when I get back, but this is not the story)

Anyway, I get to the computer by 4:30 and the following conversation happens (Yes, I talk to the computers, look what this job did to me)
&gt;**Me:** Ok baby, lets see if you can boot up.
*Computer actually boots up, but after 15 minutes, also sounds like a plane jet*
&gt;**Me:** lets open you up and see whats wrong.

After opening it, I actually found more dust than hardware inside. Having no tools around (lucky me), I try to blow air in the computer, results are the same as you imagine. Also being too lazy to take off the cooler, clean it and reapply thermal paste, I just tried to spin it and carefully remove dust underneath. To my surprize there is a big dead cockroach stuck in the middle of the heat sink, completely stopping the fan (well that explains the slow boot, maybe the noise). I clean everything up and close it thinking that's its good to go.

At that point it was 5 pm and since it was needed to be deployed early next day and I still need to make some back ups and install a bunch of software, I put everything in my car and head home for the rest of the work.

*fast forward few hours after dinner and a quick nap*

I try to boot it again, its much quicker, but still loud as hell. I open it up while its running and I find the PSU fan barely spinning and the PSU is over heating already. Thinking that I don't want to do that drive again for a failed PSU, I thought I should be on the safe side. Luckily I had another computer lying around that I started raiding for parts.

Great, now its quiet and working, let the software games begin. But I had a gut feeling that something was still not right and started checking the temps. This time I wasn't surprized, there is a 9800GT in there with a dead fan (I originally thought it works after passing a certain temp, but after 95c I lost hope). Again because I don't want to do that drive again, I get back to my spare parts, grab another card and spent some time to get that triple monitor setup running again (computer requirements)

I look at the clock and its 2:30 am, knowing it will take a few hours to install the required software and make those back ups, I started getting worried I might not make it in time, trying to hurry up.

*fast forward 2 hours after all installation is done*

Almost there, all is left is to copy a few GBs, I started retrieving those files on a portable hard drive, then copying, copying, copying slowing down, copying slowing down even more, mother of all snails speed copying and then its stuck!

No could it be........

Running a dskchk.......

Stage 2 was running like a turtle and I actually fell asleep, I woke up in shock 2 hours later to, you probably guessed it, stuck in stage 2.

rebooting the computer, stuck on boot screen...

Goodbye Hard drive. (and probably job?)


I'm gonna leave it here, and let me know if you want to know what happened next. Sorry for the mistakes, my first story here.

**TL;DR: Computer has dead stuck cockroach in the CPU heatsink, dead PSU fan, dead 9800GT fan and after fixing everything, loading up the software and while trying to back up the hard drive, it failed!**

Update: Spelling, Formatting, the rest of the story

**The Rest Of the story:** After I woke up, I packed everything back in the car and went to work, looking like crap ofcourse and got there at 9:30 am.

First Person I see was my boss and he asked ""How did it go?"", I stand there in silence for a few seconds trying to come up with a response and ended up with ""it didn't"". Next I heard the single loudest curse word in the history of humanity (It was a high priority task). I then explain to him what happened in details, he calmed down and realised how much pressure I was under. He then calls everyone in the company to only call me for critical problems, so I can focus on the new branch and pushed back that computer deadline another 2 weeks.

**Funny extra detail**
Fast forward 3 month later as everything goes back to normal, I find the computer sitting in the computer graveyard (a corner where I keep dead computers until I can revive them in my free time), I run chkdsk one more time, the computer boots fine, I run some short tests, the computer holds up and its working fine now!!!!",The computer from hell,159

3rd_Shift_Tech_Man,11,9,1oovuq,74,"Obligatory first time, long time, *yadda, yadda, yadda*...

I've been frequenting this sub for about 6 months now and I love it!  The tales range from BOFH to those with a tech aura over 9000!  It's also fun to hear the gruesome tales of users that can't click the appropriate icons or even those that can't seem to work within the program that they were hired to use!  Or worse yet, when you hear stories of those that may not be appreciated as they should.

Well, I'm hear to tell a story or two of some of the appreciative words I've received in my 3+ year tenure at my current company.  There may be a wall of text or not...I'm not sure since more may come to me once I get started.

Here goes!

**Background**

My primary job description is tier 2 support for an industry specific piece of software and another more well known piece of software.  The two communicate with each other via timed jobs from the well known software.  The specific software is old, released in 2002, I believe and is a bit funky at first, but once you understand the quirkiness, it's much easier to deal with.

**Story 1**

I was on call one weekend and it was fairly recent after my training period and I was a little nervous that I would blank on some of my training and have to call my supervisor really early in the morning.  Luckily, the weekend was fairly quiet with really simple requests.  

Then, it happened.

At around 11 pm, I receive a call from the corporate helpdesk and it went something like this...

**HD**: Hey 3rd, we haven't had a successful job from ""Well Known Software"" since about 3 pm after the upgrade.

**ME**:  So...no one's called about the failures in the last 8 hours?

**HD**:  Yeah...

**ME**:(After about 10 minutes looking at logs)It looks like whoever did the upgrade added a single character of white space in the ftp script so it keeps crapping out.  Have the guys that support these scripts make their change and let me know if it keeps failing.

I never got a call back that night, but received word from my immediate supervisor that I apparently noted a mistake made by one of the senior programmers who is known for his pompous attitude and could do no wrong.

He says to me, ""I've been trying to catch that guy in a fuckup for 6 years now and you did it within your 6 months.  Keep it up!""

**Story 2**

**User**: Hey 3rd_shift, I keep getting an error when trying to process these files in ""Industry Specific Software.""

**Me**:  Ahhh, I see the problem, looks like you accidentally added a single space in front of this field.  ""ISS"" doesn't like that and it isn't processed correctly.  Just make that change and try again.  You should be good.

**User**:  3rd_Shift, you're a steely eyed missile man!

**Last One**

The way our ticket system is set up, if you're identified as the person requesting support, you get an email once the ticket has been created and again once it has been closed.  Since I'm a greedy man, once I've been thanked by the user (if that happens), I tell them if they really want to thank me, take the 10 seconds to fill out the survey in the email they receive after I close the ticket.  If we get top marks, then an email is sent out to my supervisor and myself noting that someone thinks I did an outstanding job helping them through their issue.  Below are two of my most recent comments after receiving all 5's for my support.

**User 1**:  3rd_Shift is an asset to this company, and probably isn't getting paid enough for the amount of help he gives! (My favorite user for some reason...)

**User 2**:  3rd_Shift is a straight beast at tech support.  (I had no response but to show ***everyone***)

I asked him to be more specific, and I swear to George Carlin that I could not get a single bit of information out of him. 

To be fair, I was asking very technical questions like ""What are you trying to do?"" and ""What isn't working?"" to which he kept answering that he is not a technician and ""I don't understand why I have to give you that information. Just send me a technician."" He wouldn't even go in to the room to look at their inventory numbers.

mustfix,9,8,1ooavw,56,"A tiny bit of background, I am a one man IT team for a small headquarters office and we use a hosted email service for the company.

I get back from lunch and do my typical email check. One stood out in particular. It was from our email provider, with the subject title ""WARNING: Email Limit Exceeded"". With morbid curiosity, I open the email and start reading, taking note that it was addressed to me, our office admin, and one of our users.

&gt;We would like to bring to your attention that, according to our monitoring system, $USER has sent a total of 214 emails to 950 recipients in the last 24 hours.

lolwut?!

$USER here is in sales. And as sales goes, they're expected to send a *relatively* high number of emails as part of their normal duties. But over 200 emails, to over 900 recipients, in one day? Someone's gotta be spamming.

A quick IM is sent to her boss, who sits in an office behind me. ""I need to get in contact with $USER immediately about their email."" I get a verbal response: ""Well, there goes your afternoon!"". His response caught me somewhere between mirth and despair. On one hand, he's just washed his hands of this mess and it's up to me to decide the proper actions to take (read: punishments). On the other, it sounds like $USER has a habit of not shutting up, ever. Oh joy.

By now, I've found $USER's phone number. A call ensues:

Me: Hi $USER, this is &lt;mustfix&gt;  
U: Oh hi &lt;mustfix&gt;.  (I could hear the guilt, the notice has been read)  
M: So do you know what happened to your email?  
U: Yea.. I'm sorry. I made the company not being able to send out emails until tomorrow...   
M: No. That was a warning notice with potential consequences. Tell me what you were doing and how this happened.  
U: Well, I had this notice that I had to send out to all my contacts and then I had to send it again when there was some updated information.   
M: We have another service just for sending mass emails. 

A quick rundown of this other service and I can audibly tell $USER's mood beginning to pick up. It could have been a severe scolding, it could have been an RGE (Resume Generating Event) if email service was actually suspended, and they knew it and were expecting it.

One thing I've taken to heart since I've subbed TFTS a long time ago: Trust, but verify.  
Which means I opened $USER's mailbox and went straight to the Sent folder.  
In it was only a handful of emails dated today.  
I open up the one with an empty To: field.   

And I saw email addresses.
So many addresses.
474 specifically.
At least it was in the BCC field. 

Then I read the contents. And what do you know? It was actually a legitimate business related email.

dalgeek,11,20,1ooakp,87,"After one of my training classes on Cisco IP phones a question was posed: ""Will it mess anything up if I unplug my phone every night and reconnect it in the morning?""  For those not familiar with IP phones, most of them have a built in switch so you connect the phone to the wall jack then the computer to the phone -- this way you only need one network drop, but the computer depends on the phone being on for network access.

I explained that they *could* remove the phone every night, but the computer would lose it's network connection until the phone was reconnected and it's a bit inconvenient to crawl under/behind the desk.  I mentioned that the phones do have a cable lock slot so they can lock down the phone if they're worried about theft (the phone was in a public area that was not always staffed).

At this point the person informs me ""Oh, I'm not worried about someone stealing the phone, it's just that we had an issue in the past with someone urinating on the front desk, so we want to keep the phone from being damaged.""  I had no idea what to say to that, so I just shook my head and showed them how to reconnect the phone.

You might think this is something that would happen in a high school, but no, this was a an ""institute of higher education"".  Sigh.

This happened a couple years back: I was providing contracted enterprise support for an organization. I get a ticket in saying that the machine is giving ""an error"" whenever it boots. *sigh* ok.... deploying UltraChip.

Arrived at user's desk - turns out the error was SMART reporting imminent failure. I also learned that apparently he had been having trouble saving documents for the past two weeks and didn't bother to tell anyone. Proceed with immediate data backup and order a new hard drive (because our accounting department couldn't fathom why a tech shop servicing the HQ of their multi-million dollar client might want to keep a supply of spare parts on site.)

Here's where the story gets fun: new HDD gets delivered, I drop it in and try to kick off the reimage process. SMART warning still pops up. Weird, but I proceed anyway. Image process tries to format drive and immediately fails. 

I steal the known-good HDD our of absent coworker's computer and throw it in: still get SMART error and inability to write to drive. huh. 

Swap out SATA cable, no dice. 

I place an order for a new motherboard and call down to the user's IT manager to tell him the new HDD failed.

His response: ""What!? What's wrong with it!?""

Me: ""Well sir, we put the hard drive in but it's refusing to even format, just like our test hard drive. We want to swap out the mothe...""

Him: ""WHY IS IT BROKEN!? Did you even try to defrag it!?""

Me: ""I... what? It's a brand new hard drive?""

Him: ""!@#$ing techs... deefraaagggiiinnngggg (said real slow like I'm an idiot). It's hooowwww you fiiixxxx haarrddd drrriivveesss. It arranges the bits on the drive.""

Me (really pissed, trying to stay cordial): ""Sir.... this problem is present across several drives, and besides this drive isn't even formatted, there's no way to defra...""

Him: ""LISTEN! I have worked with computers for TEN YEARS! Just !@#$ing defrag it and get it back to the customer TODAY!""

Me: ""Let me go ahead and transfer you to my manager....""


Epilogue: Well, this might come as a shock, but after I replaced the motherboard the hard drive worked just fine, and I never once defragged it. My manager was furious with the IT manager for harassing me, and is no longer allowed to directly interact with our shop. I only feel bad for the actual user, who had to wait several weeks for his computer because of having to special order every little part.

*****

**Calls 1-3.**  Can't get online.  After troubleshooting, diagnosed as dead modem.  Customer calls back later after getting the new modem.


**Call 4.** The customer was scared to death (a young, stay at home mother) of opening her computer, but once I put it to her in the following terms: ""If you can play Legos with your 3 year old son, then you can do this.""  That got her laughing, and she got out the screwdriver and opened up the side of the case while it was laying down on the floor.  


Unfortunately, I had neglected to make sure that she had turned it off first.  So, it was still running.  She turned her back a moment to set down the screwdriver, then I hear *kkkkrrrrrchhchchchchch* over the phone.  Seems her 3 year old son had discovered that the CPU Fan made a wonderful noise if you pour Fruit-Loops into it.  


After her panicking and me getting her quickly calmed down and explaining how to fix the situation - involved turning off PC, and using a vaccuum with soft brush attachment - she told me she would call back later after it was cleaned up.


Now, with those of you who have been reading my stories, you know that I haven't even gotten to the 'conversation' part yet, which means the best is yet to come.  What is better that Fruit-Loops in a CPU fan?


**Call 5.**  She calls back in a couple hours later, and wants to continue walking through the setup.  I asked her to grab the instructions for the modem and read them quick to see whether to install the modem driver first or the modem hardware first (it DID make a difference in those days - ugh, terrible issues if you got it out of order).  She says ""oops, left the instructions in the kitchen, I'll be right back!""  She set the phone down, and I hear her walk off to another room.


During this time, I hear her son toddle past the phone, giggle, and then hear something splashing, with LOTS of giggling during the splashing..  I assume he dropped his drink or something.  His mother walks in during the middle of the splash-laugh, I hear an audible *squeek* from her, a bunch of sounds of rushing around, her muttering under her breath, and then a couple minutes later, she gets on the phone with me.


Me:  Her:

**Me:**  Are you ok?  I heard a bunch of commotion.

**Her:**  Can it be saved?

**Me:** Can what be saved?  Did he spill something on the modem?  I heard a splash.

**Her:** I came in and caught him peeing on the computer.  Can we save the computer?

**Me:**  Uhm, was it on when he peed on it?  Is he ok?  Did he get shocked?
*i make a joke at this point to help calm the situation*  Well, at least Fruit-Loops in the Heat Sink are the least of your worries at this point.

**Her:** He's ok.  You are right about the Fruit-Loops.  At least that was an easy clean-up.  Though the computer smells funny now and *GASP* OH LAWD IT'S ON FIRE!  NO SON, DON'T PEE ON IT TO PUT IT OUT!!!

**Me:** Uh... do you need me to call... *click* at this point, she hangs up.  I call the fire dept. and tell them what is going on.  I later found out that she thankfully got the fire out pretty quickly and only lost the PC and some carpet and just some slight smoke damage to the room.

Sonic5039,15,15,1onkd9,42,"So I'm not a professional in IT but as the kid in the family that now has a computer science degree (previously was the kid in the family who knew computers well enough and Google to be able to fix most problems)  I tend to get all the ""why doesn't this work""  questions. 

Background for this story involves a slight explaination of my home network setup at my parents house. The router and cable modem is located in one end of the house in my father's home office which is in the basement. On the other end of the house on the first floor is where the family room is. My parents decided to get a fancy Samsung 3d smart TV with those apps that allow Netflix, Pandora, hulu, Web browsing, etc via apps on the TV. Obviously this requires a network connection over wireless or an ethernet connection. Though depending on the wifi receiver/radio in the device you're using the signal isn't always strong where the TV is located. Example being a galaxy tab 2 gets decent wifi while my Galaxy nexus gets nearly no connection in the same spot. The TV itself rarely can see the network due to the solid ground and distance between the router and TV. 

Originally they had this netgear extender that plugged into the wall which had messed with other devices for some reason, so it wasn't being used anymore. Yet still they always wanted to try using the smart TV apps so onto the story. 

After I recently came home from college after graduating, I had bought myself a hulu plus account as I didn't like sitting in front of my computer when watching it (first world problems at its fine). Such as I showed my parents they had started thinking about getting a Netflix account or keeping the hulu plus account I had since they had agreed to pay for it. Despite me attempting to explain multiple times how the wifi signal was weak according to the TV and that the signal would constantly drop or buffer when they attempted to watch things I constantly have been asked about why they can't use hulu or Netflix (if they got it)  on the TV. Usually with me repeating the usual things about the wifi doesn't reach there or is weak that the apps probably wouldn't work great if at all. 

I really didn't find explaining this constantly worth it such had went to find a better solution. I then remembered I still had my own router from my college apartment, and it was supported by dd-wrt. Hurray I found a solution, potentially at the cost of my main ethernet connection for my laptop. Such after setting it up as a repeater for the main network the TV still seemed to attempt to connect to the main router being slow as molasses. Trying to rebroadcast the connection as a new ssid worked faster and was seen consistently but seemed still to buffer a decent amount sometimes. At least it was a start. My parents finally for the most part stopped asking about it. 

Though I still have to work out any kinks in the speed on the router that's acting as a repeater or new access point before I think it could fully count as a solution though it's a start. 

Tl;Dr the wifi dropped outside the target area, I add rockets to make it go to the destination. (better Tldr are being accepted)

You know those days that just wear you down? There's no one thing that bothers you, it's the sum of all the little things that eats away at your soul little by little until there's only bitterness remaining. I used to be happy, cheerful, glad to lend a hand no matter the problem. In most cases I still am. Just not at work. The last few years have eroded my beach of patience leaving behind cliffs of insanity. And today's not helping. It's 9AM and there's already been a few of those little moments of sheer, awe-inspiring stupidity. I'm not sure how much longer I can take it. If it were my job to fix stupid I'd be fine with it. But it's not. And fixing stupid is getting in the way of getting MY work done. Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest. So what was the little event that brought me to this state by 9AM? Stay a while and listen...  

I was at my desk catching up on the paperwork I couldn't finish yesterday. I hadn't had any caffeine yet. I was out of change for the machine so there wasn't any on the way either. I didn't even realize she was in the room when she spoke. ""Hey VengeanceCuuuuuuube?"" she mewed. I hate her; the evil one. Bane of my existence.

If you believe this, then my friends, I'm sorry. It's not true. People can truly lack intelligence in ways you can't even conceive. ""Can you help me a minute?"" I swore to myself under my breath.   

""Sure thing,"" I said as I saved my work and mentally prepared myself. I crossed the lab and found her rotundity seated at the $60,000 pinball machine I refer to as the E4991. ""What's up?""
  
""I need to save this but it's broken."" She doesn't meet my stare. I briefly wonder if somewhere deep down she's aware of how stupid she actually is. I quickly snap back from the mental rabbit hole.  

""What do you mean...broken?"" I ask. This is a pretty typical error description for her. It takes patience with this one. 

""Whenever I hit save it just says 'read only' or something and I can't save it."" I look to the top of her spreadsheet and see the word ""Template"" in the title. I see her move the mouse over to the save button and click. Sure enough the warning comes up and prompts her to save as something else.

""You're using the template. I protected it so you couldn't save over it like last time. Remember? You have to use 'Save As' and give it a new name."" 

She stares at the screen, still not meeting my gaze. Finally she turns to me and says, ""How do I do that?""

Without missing a beat (I knew this was coming after all) I start to explain. ""Click your mouse on the Office Button, the one at the top left."" (Man I miss the file menu, so much easier to talk users through.) She moves her mouse over the save button and clicks that instead. Same warning comes up. ""No, not that. That's the save button. Clear the error and click the Office Button."" She fumbles with the prompt. Trying to click on everything but what she actually needs to. Finally she clicks the X and a save as prompt automatically comes up! ""Hey great, that's what we-"" I'm cut off as she INSTANTLY closes the file prompt. It's as if she can't figure out how to click on the things she needs but the moment she's where she needs to be she clicks on the exact opposite with the speed and skill of a master hacker. ""Er...okay nevermind. Click on the Office Button."" She fumbles but finally finds it. ""Okay now hit 'Save As.'"" Somehow she manages not to screw it up and the file prompt comes up. 

""See? It's not working!"" I mentally facepalm and calmly proceed to tell her that this is exactly what she needs. So she hits save. And is immediately told that there's already a file with that name. 

""No no, you need to give it a new name.""

""What? How?"" No, there's no way. This woman works with computers all day, every day. She lives in Excel. Okay breathe. Put your pen back in your pocket, you can't stab her with that. It'd make a mess and you'd actually have to make physical contact with her.

Today though she has just said something that completely dumbfounded me.

But first, a little reminder how great she is with her thin bundle of joy

*****

**Back to the begining**

Her current, old WinXP laptop is starting to get some memory errors but instead of reformatting it, updating drivers and then calling HP, we've decided to finally bite the bullet and transfer her onto her Mac running Parallels.

After she tried to do it herself 3 times resulting it's graphics being completely ruined, she decided that it was time I take a look.

So it starts, one morning when we're slightly less than 100% busy we spin up the Windows 7 VM that we use for imaging and install the special 'Parallels' software and get the transfer started. All appears to be going smoothly until she lets it slip into sleep mode. Luckily it was smart enough to continue where it left off once she tapped it back awake (which I'm actually impressed with [the software, not her]).

Once that seemingly endless process was complete, it was time to install all the admin software that we use, not on the standard image.

She installs the first one, it prompts to restart, so she does and installs 20+ updates Windows wants, all the while just sitting there getting frustrated she can't do anything in the mean-time.

It finally finishes, so she boots into it again and runs the next program installer. Again, it prompts for a restart so she goes along with it. Again, installing the 20+ more updates windows wants (I know, I know... I just haven't had time to update the image lately)

After some more ""Windows is so dumb, why are all these updates taking so long. Macs never do this"" she's back to her Mac desktop and booting into the Windows VM once again. By this point, I'm a little annoyed at her slagging Windows so much so I decided to shut her up by giving her no reason to complain. I figure Parallels works exactly the same as every other VM software so there MUST be a way to switch screens without waiting for it to go through the whole shutdown process.

To google! [""switch desktops in parallels""](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=switch+desktops+in+parallels&amp;l=1)

Hmm, not the top result... maybe if I change the wording...

And again [""switch full screen desktop in parallels""](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=switch+full+screen+desktops+in+parallels)

Close enough! I now have my answer!

Just as she finished installing the next application and started the shutdown I walked over and tapped the 'F6' key on her keyboard.

&gt; Boss: ""How did you do that??""

&gt; Me: ""F6""

&gt; Boss: ""Wow, aren't macs great!""

*****

**Clamshell**

If you're at all familiar with what 'Clamshell' mode is for macs, you already know too much, and probably deserve as many drinks as it takes to forget it.

So we'd finally got the mac up and running with parallels working surprisingly well. Next task was to get the mac to be able to close whist still displaying on an external screen.

With Windows it's relatively easy (or at least seems like it since I've been doing it for a while) to set up the power settings and just click the 'Do Nothing' box when 'Lid is closed'.

But for mac, it's not quite the same. After a good 1/2 hour or so of Boss putting the mac to sleep by closing it and then opening it again, I decided to do what I do best. To google!

[""Close Mac, External Monitor""](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=close+mac%2C+external+monitor&amp;l=1) Yeeep... bullseye

So I explain to her that she needs to press the power button to turn the mac on, wait until she sees the apple logo and then close the mac. She does so, and it works.

Seems all well and fine, but she just can't leave something fine alone...

&gt; Boss: ""Wow, that is easy, I love how intuitive Macs are!""

&gt; Me: ""But that's not intuitive? Otherwise you would have got it...""

This was a while back, when the Sims 3 was released for PC. My cousin, who remembered playing the Sims on PS2 many yesteryears ago, decides to buy it. She had an Acer netbook at the time.

Predictably, as soon as she got out of the menus and to the actual game, it came to a screaming halt with a mighty &lt;1FPS.

She called EA and started screaming at them. This call went on for ~30 minutes, with the tech support guys at EA telling her the exact same thing that I told her. The netbook wasn't up to snuff for the game.

Cue epic #wtfragequit. She tells the EA guy 'Where to go and how to get there,' slams the phone down, grabs her netbook, fires it across the room like a damned frisbee, and walks away like nothing happened.

One of our products is a thing that, among other uses, makes phone calls. Today a customer comes in and is having an issue. Shock of shocks he knew he had to make an appointment and did and now here he is. He gets checked in and assigned to a tech. We'll call him Matt. 

Now Matt is not dumb but he's not as smart as he thinks he is about all things. And this gets him into trouble sometimes. He tends to over fix things. Like wanting to do a full erase and reinstall on a computer that just needs a preference file trashed and rebuilt. I think he likes to show off and try to impress folks with all his IT knowledge.

So he gets this customer, Ricky. Ricky's issue is that his phone's display has image burn in. Not dead pixels or wonky color but an actual image 'burned in, on the display. Which is basically impossible. Matt runs all kinds of tests etc. Suggests that it might be something in Ricky's software and does like give different resets etc. Finally after 20 minutes of all this (in what was supposed to be a ten minute appointment)  Matt concludes that it is indeed a defective display. Trouble is that Ricky's phone is over a year old and a model where the display can't be swapped, you have to do the whole thing . And it was out of warranty so Ricky was going to have to pay like $200. He couldn't just upgrade etc.

He's telling me the issue while he's doing the paperwork. It's such a weird issue that I ponder out loud if the display is legit or not. Perhaps it's an aftermarket display. Matt says he didn't check so I grab a light etc to examine it.

First thing I notice is that the screen when 'locked' is totally black. Odd that a burned in image is only appearing when the backlight is off. So I turn it on. Literally one second and have the answer. I stop Matt and tell him to follow me. I go to the cx and show him that it's not burn in. He was using a screen shot from the web browser app as his wallpaper and seeing the clock etc from that image. Less than 30 seconds and I had found him a photo of the basketball team logo he wanted, showed him out to save it and load it properly and he was on his way.

smpstech,12,38,1olkgy,196,"I work tech support/customer support in a company that makes software for Police Departments to write electronic crash reports. We then host a website where people who were involved in the accident, Insurance companies, or Law Firms can go to retrieve a copy of the report if they need to as long as they have the information given to them by the Police Officer at the scene of the accident. 

So I get this woman on the phone from a small insurance company located in the midwest. I knew right away this was going to be a fun one the way she instantly starts going on and on about how ""it's always a battle to use this system,"" etc... 

So she puts in a request because she has obviously never used our website before and does not provide any information needed. This particular police department requires only a date of the accident and a report number, which they can get from the insured. When we send back an email telling her the report is ready, she calls us. It went something like this:

**Me:** Hi, thank you for calling XXXXXX, my name is XXXXX how may I help you?

**Woman:** I received the email back from your company and it just tells me absolutely nothing not even a claim number.

**Me:** Alright, well lets pull up this report in our system real quick and see whats going on with it. Do you know the name of the police department and the report number.

*She gives the correct information and continues to rant about how terrible our site is and its always a struggle though she obviously has never used it as she didn't even know the site's web address.*

**Me:** Alright, I have the report here, its showing its available so have you tried searching for it on our website?

**Woman:** Well, I can't even search for it as this email has no information. What was the date? *Note: She had just given me the date, Report number, and Last name of someone involved not 2 minutes ago.*

**Me:** Alright, you should be able to search for the report with just the accident date and report number for this particular department. 

**Woman:** But what's our claim number? It's not in this email you sent us and that means I'm going to have to search through all of our claim numbers until I find it.

**Me:** The police report is the one written by the officer at the scene of the accident. I do not see why there would be a claim number on the report, as the report was written not 15 minutes after the accident occurred. 

**Woman:** Well, what do they expect us to organize all our claims by police report number? Why can't they just put our claim number on the report? 

**Me:** Ma'am, your company issues the claim numbers, the State issues the report numbers. We can't have officers waiting hours or sometimes days in the field for your company to issue the involved parties claim numbers so they can add them to the Accident reports.

To give an example, we do discharges out of hospitals, and we get a fax for each each (sent to us as a pdf in an e-mail) patient we discharge.  When we print them out, they're on average about 8 pages, and do a decent amount of trips a day.  

Our printer has hit the 100k+ mark, which is about the lifespan of the laser and some other piece that escapes my mind right now.  I put together a quick e-mail to my boss to explain to him what parts we need replaced, and he can either take it to a certified repairman, or he can buy the parts and I try to fix it.  Ignoring it can be done, but it's already showing gaps where it just won't print anymore.

His response was simply: ""instead of paying for these parts, can't we just reset the printer count?  That should fix the errors and the page printing, right?""

**The Entity**

One of our employees brought his computer in.  It was of the notorious ""EMachines"" breed.  Anyone who has worked on one knows that they are simply the worst computers sold at our fine establishment.  Employee complained of fans dying, overheating, unexpected shutoffs.  Wanted free service, naturally.  Thinking the problem was electrical, I whip out the multimeter and pop the case.  Powered computer on.  STENCH.  I powered through the smell and tested fan leads.  12V.  Computer warms up over 3 or 4 minutes as I wait for a failure.  No such failure.  I see what appears to be a dense dust bunny in the bottom corner of the computer and suggest that we clean with compressed air.  Upon further inspection, the mass appears solid.  Human nature takes over.  I grab my screwdriver.  *poke*.  Ball turns from a ball into a writhing mass of insects.  Ball disintegrates into what seemed like hundreds of little bugs, scattering to cover the circuitry of the motherboard.  Some are zapped when they become the path of least resistance.  Computer becomes one big NOPE.  We close the computer and entomb it in plastic wrap.  Employee experiences eternal shame and never picks the computer up.  It stayed on our shelves for months until policy allowed us to dispose of the unit.

**Little Head of Household**

Circa PS2 heyday, back when we handled all returns, not just computers.  Mother and child approach counter with a Playstation 2.  Unit won't power on. PS2's are currently repair items that need to ship to a depot.  One of the guys explains this.  Because there is strength in numbers, I walk over and tell her the same thing in different verbiage. The mother understands and prepares to hand the paperwork over to us.  Strike up conversation with the annoyed boy (couldn't have been more than 10).  I ask him what his favorite game is.  ""GTA 3"".  I Laugh.  He's too young to be playing it.  Humor/challenge him by asking what his favorite mission is.  ""I don't do missions.  I like running over hookers.""  I'm astounded.  I'm waiting for mom to intervene.  No such intervention.  ""I need my game from the CD drive.""  Sure enough, it's GTA3.  Attempt to give the game to mom.  ""It's mine.""  Child snatches it from my hand.  Mom gingerly hands over paperwork and child performs the most insane thing I've ever seen from a pre-pubescent.  I'm literally pausing for emphasis.  Ready?  Seriously... ready?  Child reaches up, grabs mother by the CHIN.  Pulls her down to his level and says, with all of the seriousness of a serial killer:  ""We will not be sending this off.  We will be buying a new one.""  Looks mother dead in the eye.  I mean, just some straight up gangsta sh*t.  Mother calmly waits for child to release her, looks at us, and says:  ""We'll just buy another one.""  Child and mother walk off.  Read that series of sentences again,  I'll wait.  We were all disturbed.  I know my mother would have inserted that GTA CD into my anus had I even attempted something like that, then she would have slapped the teeth out of my mouth and then forced me to eat the PS2.  That was in 2005... I can imagine where that kid is now.  Hopefully in a super-max penitentiary.

**The Chemistry Lesson**

It is a well known fact that waiting for a depot repair sucks.  It takes weeks and half of the time, your item isn't fixed because, well, depot repair guys care more about leaving at 5pm than fixing the things they fix.  So, for some nice customers, we would ensure that the item being sent to the depot was unrepairable.  Cue the DC Generator.  Originally slated for supplying 12v DC to components for testing, it led a double life as an assassin.  Two seconds when connected across capacitors and such led to the release of that acrid magic smoke and the impending disposal of the host product by the depot team, ensuring a replacement unit was in order.  The electrical assassin was also used for fun.  Frying circuit boards was a favored past-time of bored employees.  My co-worker and I were partaking in said activity when we decided to see how badly we could burn out a PCI modem.  After many minutes of frying components and spraying capacitor liquid onto the wall, we employed our second favorite item into the mix... compressed air.  Not 150psi of air... canned air.  When held upside down, a freezing stream of chemical is ejected and can even cause frostbite on bare skin.  It's perfect for cooling down burning components, right?  1/2 a spray can later, and its subsequent sublimation into a gas, we cause a chip to arc and burn in an ember of awesomeness.  The chemical in the canned air reached an ignitable fuel-air mixture.  And did it ever ignite.  WHOMP!  The entire table becomes engulfed in flames, igniting the arms of my co-worker and creating copious amounts of ozone.  Customer on the other end of the department leans across the counter to enjoy the festivities.  Co-worker runs around the bench with flaming arm hair.  I could only imagine ""Danger, Will Ronbinson!"" as he robotically attempted to wave off the fire.  Entire department smells like burnt hair and spent chemicals.  In the ultimate act of cowardice, I conveniently notice that it's time for me to clock out and I disappear from the premises, knowing that I was probably going to get fired.  I didn't, and the accident became legend.  8 years later, I still catch crap for my ""exit stage right"" maneuver from my buddy/victim.  ",My Classics: Part Deux,754

If she fucks up, IT did it, it was working fine yesterday until they did something (that usually had nothing to do with what we actually did...)

Also she blamed IT for her not being able to get work done. Looking at the event logs we found she had turned the laptop on twice in two months....

Bee-do

I heard the all too familiar sound of Outlook reciving an email. ""Ugh!"" I thought to myself as I reminisced on the days when I felt special with each and every email.

Between my bitches, the all-hands announcements, and occasionally some actual work, I was easily getting 30-50 emails a day. ""Needy fucks.""

I read the little popup notification. ""ALERT: TEMPERATURE WARNING"". For fuck's sake. I know it's hot outside. It's Iraq. In the summer.

I hate having unread emails in my inbox. I don't know, it's probably some OCD thing. The email pops up. But I clicked on the email.

    From: some automated address
    To: Server Team Distro Group
    Subject: ALERT: TEMPERATURE WARNING
    
    RED ALERT! ALL HANDS TO BATTLE STATIONS!
    
    The temperature in the Alternate Technical Control
    Facility has reached 100 degrees.

""That's not right,"" I thought to myself.

I wasn't too worried about it, though. We were always having problems with the temperature sensors. Those systems just did not like all of the moon dust floating around.

For those of you that have never been to a desert, everything gets sand in it, no matter how hard you try to keep it out, no matter how many filters you install. You always have moon dust in everything.

The climate monitoring systems in out technical control facilities were only an exception to this rule in that they tended to collect more dust than anything else. Because of this, they were in a constant state of malfunction.

But I called the server chief all the same. If there really was something wrong we needed to get it under control.

""Hey SSgt Tony, It's LCpl McSparklenuts. Did you see the alert email about the temperature in the alt TCF?""

""Nah I unsubscribed to the alerts. I was getting too many of them. What's going on?""

""Well the temperature sensor reached 100 deg... wait I just got another email. 110 degrees. The temperature is rising down there. Services still seem to be up, but if its really that hot in there, it won't last for long.""

""Hang on. I'll call down there and see what's going on.""

We both hung up our phones. I sat there getting ready to start shutting things down remotely while I waited for him to call me back.

The phone rings.

""Hey LCpl McSparklenuts, the guys down at the alt TCF aren't answering the phone. I need you to go down there and check this out.""

""Roger that, SSgt.""

I donned my flak jacket and kevlar, grabbed my rifle and prepared myself for the journey ahead. The alt TCF was easily 3/4 of a mile away and the vehicle was gone. Fuck. Guess I'm walking.

As you can imagine, a 3/4 mile walk when it's 120 degrees outside is not fun. As soon as I stepped outside, all the energy that I may have ever had in my body was instantly eliminated. But I diligently trudged through the sand and rock and proceeded to my destination.

As I closed in, a horrifying site met my eyes. The air was thick with smoke, and was that the air conditioning unit was on fire?

""Oh this is just not my day,"" I thought to myself as I ran over to the breaker box. I cut the power, grabbed the fire extinguisher and managed to put out the fire thanks to that mandatory fire warden class I had attended only a few weeks prior. Wow! That wasn't just a complete waste of my time!

As if on cue, the Marines that were supposed to be manning the TCF walked around the corner carrying their little styrofoam boxes of food from the chow hall. The look of shock on their faces was priceless.

I quickly explained the situation to them as we moved towards the door of the facility.

We entered. Another horrifying site, but not unexpected. The temperature sensor was working perfectly. It was a bone-chilling 130 degrees inside that facility. Alarms were emanating from just about every network device.

I ran over to the phone to call SSgt Tony.

""SSgt, there was a fire down here. The A/C is cauput. We need a new one. I'm going to try to shut everything down to try and save the equipment.""

""No don't shut it down, that'll take too long. Just turn it off. We have backups if need be.""

I called out to the others so they could start turning everything off while I finished up on the phone.

""Uhh what do you want to do about the file share, SSgt? We don't have redundancy on that right now.""

""Can you get it down to the other TCF?""

""The vehicle was gone. I had to walk down here.""

""Well just leave it on. We can't have it go down right now.""

""SSgt, if I leave it on, its only going to be a matter of minutes before the thing turns itself off.""

""Shit, I forgot it does that. You gotta get that thing down to the other TCF as fast as possible.""

""Roger that.""

There was only one thing I could do at this point. I disconnected the file share, pulled it out, and ran.

3/4 of a mile isn't that far when you are walking. It seems a little bit further when you are wearing a flak and kevlar, but still not too bad. But sprinting with an additional 150 lbs of weight on you with a rifle getting in the way of your legs is painful. I'm surprised I didn't die from heat exhaustion.

But I made it. As I arrived with the file share, puffing for breath, the LAN team was jsut finishing up the switch configs to put the share online without having to change IP addresses and DNS entries. Well that was a relief I guess.

My fellow server team members took the machine  But I just grabbed a bottle of water and collapsed to the fetal position on the floor.

My respite was interrupted, however, by our diligent lieutenant walking through the door. He was dressed only in his workout gear carrying his protein in one hand and the keys to the truck in the other. 

""Why the fuck are you just sitting there when there is an emergency?! You should be help...""

He was interrupted by SSgt Tony, there to save my ass.

""Look, sir. LCpl McSparkle just ran 3/4 of a mile, if full PPE, with that server over there. I told him he could take a break. I would remind you, sir, that had you not taken the truck to go to the fucking gym, he wouldn't have had to do that. Give the kid a break.""

The lieutenant was furious, but he had a new target. He left beckoning SSgt Tony to follow him.

Surprisingly getting the file share up again only took a couple of minutes. I was expecting problems, but there were none. That was a relief.

I got back in my chair and got settled in watching some show or another, intent on not doing any work for the rest of the day.

The door opened again and in walked the Lt. and SSgt Tony. The Lt murmured some form of apology and scampered. Lt's don't like to apologize.

SSgt Tony stuck around for a bit, though. I thanked him for taking the heat off me and asked him how bad things were.

""Meh I just got a bit of an ass chewing for talking to him like that. I'm a SSgt. There's not much they can do to me.""

He tried to give me the rest of the day off. I declined and told him I would stay. I had internet at work, so I was happy with that, and there really wasn't that much left to do for the day.

Calls were made and the A/C unit replaced the next day. The investigator said that the previous unit had faulty wiring and had just been a ticking time bomb. We got everything back online and things were happy. 

Ahh, well. So go the days of deployed IT. But I can say, that was the one and only time I ever had to run with a server. Over the next couple days, we got some policy changes passed around. Top of the list? Vehicles are for official use only. What timing!

SigonLegacy,13,20,1ojiea,77,"So, I work for a little company that designs microprocessors. Specifically low powered ones. Regardless, I typically man the helpdesk along with other colleagues where we sort incoming tickets out and resolve the more mundane issues.

I get a ticket into the main front line support queue and take a look over it. Someone can't launch their virtual machine and it won't show up in VMware Player at all. I take the ticket and SSH into their machine. All of our linux machines have the virtual machines stored in a separate partition that's mounted to the root directory under /Virtual_Machine. So I do what anyone else would do.

cd /Virtual_Machine

ls

Nothing.

Weird. At that point, I decide to call them up to see what's going on.

Me: Hi, this is SigonLegacy with IT. Just got a ticket in because you couldn't launch your VM, right?

User: Yeah! I try to launch my virtual machine but I can't find the VMX file anywhere.

Me: Well, I just remoted into your machine and I don't show that there's anything in the Virtual_Machine folder.

User: Er... Yeah, about that. I may have... done something to make it not be there.

Me: What? Uh... just run me through what you were doing.

User: Well, I was running low on space and I noticed the Virtual_Machine folder was taking up a bit of space, so I ran rm -rf on it.

Me: ... Okay. Uh, you erased your virtual machine, then.

User: Oh... Could you get it back for me?

Me: Yeah, no. You erased it. I can copy a new one over, though.

User: Oh. Well, go ahead and do that, then. Thanks!

ofd227,13,25,1ojhi0,149,"Working in a very large old hospital you learn that in the majority of the building you cant hear the person in the next room scream, let alone get any wifi signals.   This was a fact of life for anyone working in the gut of the building.  I rarely got any trouble calls about reception from people in this area unless they where a new employee and couldn't comprehend dead spots.

Well, one day the help desk phone rings and its a person that I had just moved into essentially the bottom center of the facility.  She couldn't be any further under steel and cement unless she was in Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker.  She begins to explain in a panic that her fax machine isn't getting reception.  She states that she has to ""open the door to her office ""in order to send any faxes"".  She also blames the dead spot for the fact shes only received a ""couple"" faxes since shes moved in the office ( It had been 2 days ).   So I go down there to see whats up and am able to send and recieve faxes with no issue.  To this day she still claims I ""did something to the wifi"" to make it better in her office.

firestorm_v1,29,45,1oiw5y,215,"This was a story from back in the day when I ran my own contract company with a buddy of mine.  This customer was a large psych office and was a big deal for both of us so we wanted to make sure they stayed happy. We arrived on site and my friend went about working on the phone stuff and I talked to the lead doc (the owner) about what was going on.

    Him:  Well ever since you two did that expansion (24 phones, 24 network, about four months ago), we've
         been having some problems.
    Me: What are you experiencing, can you show me?
    Him:  The 3270 is slow.

For some reason, the entire office was running a 3270 terminal emulator to access their medical records datastore No one knew the name of the application, but just called it ""the 3270"" even though it somewhat irked me on a lower level. This software must have fallen out of the 80's, but it served their needs well and up until now, I left it alone as it just worked as long as there was Internet access to the office. While the office was a ""large"" deployment ( at least 40 devices after the expansion), the network was a simple business router and two-switch stack. Hardly a complex solution. I hadn't really messed with the 3270 software but I did know it was a hosted application and that issues with it usually mean Internet connectivity problems for the office.

I started out with my usual troubleshooting methods and stopped short when I found that he had about every letter in the alphabet mapped to a network share on some server that was obviously down.  Every mapping had the big red ""X"" through it so I knew something was up.

    Me: What's the deal with these mapped drives?  You don't have a server around here, do you?
    Him: Oh we do, but that's been like that for ages. It wouldn't affect the 3270 will it? 
    Me: It shouldn't, but that's kind of a big deal if you have a server and you can't get to it. Let's address the
       server first and then we'll get to the 3270.  I'm more concerned about access to all those shared drives
       right this moment. When was the last time you accessed the server?
    Him: Well, it's been about a year now.
    Me: Has anyone else been able to access the server?
    Him: Not for a long time. I figured it just kind of expired.

At this point, I was floored.  The last time they had an outage was when the Internet went down at their site and they called me six times in as many minutes, freaking out because they couldn't access their medical records datastore. I got them back up and running quickly (reboot the router, test internet, test 3270, good to go), but still had never seen any evidence of a local server until today.

    Me: Do you know where this server is in the building?
    Him: Yes, it's in [name redacted]'s office.
    Me: Ok, let's go check it out. 

We walked into another office and I started tracing the cat5 from the wall jack.  It went under the worker's desk, and into what appeared to be a service panel built into the wall. I opened the service panel came across a very dusty keyboard and a black and white monitor with the ""Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to login"" prompt burned into the screen. Tucked away behind the monitor was the server that time (and everyone) forgot.

This was an old NT-4 AT computer in a generic white-with-black-plate computer box that was covered with dirt, rust, and about a half inch of dust. I'm surprised Indiana Jones didn't find this thing first. I pulled the machine out from its crypt and sure enough, the server had died a rather painful death a long time ago from what appeared to be a blown power supply judging from the scorch marks on the back of the case.  Upon seeing this, the doctor freaked out saying that it was suddenly the most critical thing in the world and that his entire business would go down in flames (of course, which is why it was put in a maintenance crawlspace....)

    Him: Oh my god! Please tell me you can fix it!
    Me: I don't know.  I may be able to, but this thing is so trashed, I am not sure if it will be recoverable. At
        the least I can try to do data recovery on it or we can send the hard drive off if I am unable to.
    Him: How long will that take?
    Me:  If I can replace the power supply and the machine works, I'll bring it tomorrow. If not, but the drive 
        works, a couple of days.  If we need to send it off to a data recovery specialist, it could be a month or
        more and will be quite expensive.  It all depends on the hardware.
    Him: How are we going to access the 3270 now?
    Me:  This server has been down for quite some time, at least a year.  How have you been normally 
        accessing the 3270?
    Him: (describes process).
    Me: Well, let's try it now and see what happens.

He and I go back to his office and he starts up his 3270 emulator and it connects.  He logs in and pokes around a bit and breathes a sigh of relief.

    Him: Looks like the server is working.
    Me: No, your 3270 is a hosted application elsewhere.  The server that I pulled out of that crawlspace has
        nothing to do with the 3270.
    Him: What?  Are you sure?
    Me: Up until an hour ago, I didn't even know you had a server.  The 3270 connects to a hosted application 
        which is running on a server in a datacenter probably on the other side of the country.  You're fine.

He gives me that look of shock, then panic, then slowly eases back into some semblance of ""not freaking the heck out"".

    Me: So what do you want me to do with the server? Do you want me to try and do some data recovery on it 
        or do you want to hang on to it?
    Him: (still skeptical of the 3270 application) Let's see if everyone else can connect to 3270, then we'll see.

Insert another hour of running around from person to person trying to connect.  Everyone was able to connect successfully and rightful order had been restored.

    Me: How about this, I'm going to take the server and pull the hard drive and put it into an enclosure for 
        you.  The computer itself is garbage, but the hard drive may be OK.  This way if you need any files off
        of it, you can plug it in like a keydrive and find what you need.
    Him: Sounds good to me although I'm not sure anyone has used it so it may not even be needed anymore.

I took the server home and sure enough, the motherboard was shot and I didn't have a replacement I could put in so I gave him the hard drive (after I had confirmed it was working) in a USB drive sled enclosure. Indiana Jones would be proud. I unearthed an old 233MHz Pentium II computer running NT4 which had met its demise in the deep dark recesses of a crawlspace in a psychiatric office that no one was aware of until a hosted application that wasn't even local stopped working and required investigation.

*tl;dr:* customer forgot about server in crawlspace. customer doesn't know the difference between local application and hosted application. Much head-desking performed.

thndrchld,43,37,1oitpw,260,"It couldn't have been simpler.  

This morning, I received an order that all our field offices need to return a particular optional component on their printer to our maintenance company.  Like the trooper I am, I went to our printer armed with a screwdriver and camera.

I documented every step of the process.  

1.  Unplug printer.
2.  Open this door (cue picture of printer with arrow pointing to door)
3.  Unplug this cable (cue picture of printer with arrow pointing to cable)
4.  Gently pull this object straight out (cut picture of object with big red arrow)
5.  Ship it to me.

I ended up not even needing the screwdriver.  I sent out an email to all operations managers with these simple directions and photos.

So far, all but one have done it without trouble.  

But there's always one, isn't there?  

Ten minutes ago I received a photo of said printer module... in three pieces with an absolutely shredded metal casing.

Apparently, it was sticky, so instead of calling to see what they should do, they took a crowbar to it.  That's right -- a crowbar -- to their $3,000-or-so printer.

Bagellord,29,16,1oihfa,42,"This is quite long winded and somewhat rantish.

In my post from last night I talked about how I'm partially in charge of the mobile division (I handle the technical side while my partner in crime handles the logistics and purchasing). My decisions are all technical and programming related. Anyways. Our latest project is to redo the time and attendance solution.

How does this involve us you ask? I'll explain by going backwards. Our current time and attendance (henceforth tanda) uses a remote desktop session (or remote app in some cases) for the management side and the in/outs are taken using a stupidly expensive hand scan thing. This thing takes a magic IR picture of your hand and figured out if it's you (you also enter your employee number). This solution is costing us big bucks.

Our new idea is to take a small wifi only Android tablet and secure it to the wall (I got put in charge of that), lock it down with our MDM (I figured it out to), and have an app on there to do the clock in and out (again, me). It's pretty simple. Enter your employee number and it snaps a photo using the front facing camera and then posts it to the web server.

Naturally when this was announced there was much moaning and groaning about the picture. But they are just going to have to deal with it. Now this wouldn't be a TFTS if there wasn't some kind of insane deadline and requirements and stuff out of my control in the way, right? Oh wait there is. The deadline for having the entire system in place is January 1 when our contract with our current solution ends. We have 50 offices across the country that will need tablets shipped and installed. But we can't trust our users to assemble it all properly. So everything will come to corporate first for yours truly to configure (install MDM, set up the app, etc) and assemble into the mount (yay security screws!) and ship (yay knowing how to use the shipping computer!) out. In total, 60 devices need to be set up as some places, like corporate, will need more than one.

Sounds fun right? We don't have the hardware ordered yet (waiting for quotes) and getting our hands on samples is proving to be difficult as well, especially the security kits. Plus we had huge issues getting the wifi to work since the POE tablet we wanted to use wouldn't work out since it started triggering alerts on the firewall when we turned it on...

Anyways I will keep TFTS posted as we move through our saga. I'm really looking forward to stuff in the web service changing and me having to get every single tablet updated remotely...",The project begins,58

If you have ever lived out in the boonies, the sticks, middle-of-nowhere, etc., then you know that sometimes the darndest 'small things' are what cause big issues/outages.  


Being the morning guy for saturdays (2 of us covered saturdays and sundays as those were our lightest workload days, I did 7am-5pm), it was usually the most uneventful day of the week.  I would usually bring in a dvd or a portable hdd (well, an IDE drive in an external adapter - this was in 2005) and watch movies most of my shift, as it was unusual to get more than 1-2 calls on Saturday morning.


This particular morning, I get in, and go through my usual routine and get logged into the ticket system and the various servers so I can get access to what I need.  Before I log into the phone, I check the radius server to see if anyone is having issues dialing-in, and notice that we have practically nobody online.  ""Weird"", I think to myself, but shrug it off.  


At about 8am, I get a call from someone that isn't a customer, but is at the National Telecom CO that rhymes with Horizon just down the street from us.  They are wanting us to know that one of the lines we leased from them that covered the southern 1/3 of the state was down and should be up by later that evening.  I finally connect 2 and 2 and come up with 6.  I call the owner and let him know what is going on, he sighs, and says just deal with it and we'll prorate bills.  Gotcha, boss man!


Come close to time for shift changeover, I get my 2nd call of the day - the National Telecom CO again.  The lady on the other end sounds frustrated, and is apologizing to me over and over profusely before I can even ask what is going on.  She said that the tech would call me personally tomorrow morning (the next day, Sunday) and explain everything, but that service wouldn't be back up until Monday because they had to bring in extra parts.  Ok, I can understand that.  Sucks for us and our customers, but it happens.


Come Sunday morning about 10am, I get my only call of the day.  It is the National Telecom CO field tech on the phone.  He apologizes for about 10 minutes before I can get him to explain what went on.  This is a paraphrased and heavily sanitized version of the conversation, ME, and TECH:
*****
ME: So, what can you tell me so I can pass it on to customers so they can understand better why our service was out?

TECH: Well, uh, uhm.... do you really wanna know?

ME: Sure.  It helps to explain to customers so they aren't so mad.

TECH: It involved chainsaws and bees.

ME: Wut?

TECH:  I was doing maintenance on the line and had to cut some limbs off a junction box.  While I was doing this, a limb I was cutting on happened to be hollow and full of bees.  As soon as I realized it, I panicked and dropped the chainsaw.  The chainsaw's deadman switch didn't work, and it kept running as it cut through the junction box and lines while I was diving out of the cherry-picker trying to get away from bees.

ME:  *stunned*  Wow.  I don't think the customers will believe it.

TECH:  My supervisor didn't either, until he saw the bee swarm when he went to get the company chainsaw that was still stuck in the junction box.

Smallwater,251,172,1ohvjr,713,"TFTS, I guess you all like a change from the stories of idiot users and annoying bosses who don't know shit. Let me give you some hope in humanity.  
I [told](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1o5rgl/lights_on_router_out/) [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1obnqg/router_from_hell_or_user_from_hell_its_difficult/) that I don't work in IT. I'm still in college, and I do study IT. I also live in a dorm, but I go home on Fridays so I can see my parents, do a parttime job on Saturdays, and get my clothes washed.  
Now, most of the inhabitants of my dorm are pretty awesome. They're cool guys/gals, and all is well. There are some of them who are pretty good with computers, but for whatever reason, everyone comes to me with their digital problems. Not that I mind, most of the time it's just a simple reboot or a loose wire.  
Now, one of my friends there, let's call him Bro, is absolutely dreadful with computers. I'm talking 4 different toolbars, a system full with bloatware, a HDD to the brim with temp files and useless clutter, his system looks like a 90-year old's PC. He is, however, an awesome dude, who likes the same sort of games, movies, or anime like me, and I can spend hours in his room just discussing gaming in general, or watching some series.  
One day, he called me, and asked me to take a look at his PC. It had stopped working. I was thinking it may be some simple virus, or maybe its HDD was just finally too full. I loaded up some cleaning programs on a USB stick, and made my way to his room.  
I didn't need the USB stick.  
I was greeted by a black screen, with white text on it. I don't really remember what it said, but I knew it was fucked. I tried rebooting it (to no avail), and looked it up on Google (also to no avail).  
I couldn't possibly fix this. It had transcended from the mortal plane of IT into the realm of complete bustedness. I told Bro ""sorry, I can't fix this. I will have to reinstall it""  
That was a problem, as Bro didn't have the money for a new (see PS) Windows CD (A backup? What's a backup?), and didn't want an illegal copy, so I suggested installing Ubuntu.  
Being as computer illiterate as he is, he didn't know about Ubuntu. So I explained to him what it was, showed him some sites on my phone, but he didn't really like it.  
""I'm not too good with computers, I don't want something technical like that, and then fuck it up""  
""Bro, what do you use your PC for?""  
""uhh, internet, video, and downloading""  
""Then Linux isn't too much for you. I can install VLC, a torrent program, and Firefox for you, and you can do what you want""  
Alright, Bro was onboard. I quickly burned a brand new shiny Ubuntu 12.4 install CD for him, and I installed it on his PC. By now it was deep in the night, 2 - 3 AM, and he finally got a working PC with all the programs he needed. All was good, and I went to bed.  
The next day was a Friday, and I went home for the weekend. I packed my bags, and went to the train station. As I was on the train, I get a textmessage from Bro, claiming he can't watch videos using VLC. It gives a errormessage, but since I'm on the train without internet access, I can't help him. I apologize, tell him I'll look into it when I get back (since he could still use the computers, just VLC broke), which wasn't a problem.  I advised him to use google to find a solution, just search for the error.  
Weekend goes by, and I return to my dorm. I unpack, and hop over to Bro's room, to see if I can fix his computer. To my surprise, he had already fixed it.  
""I just used Google like you said, and found a solution. It's all working again now!""  
I was glad to see the problem resolved itself, and put it out of my mind.  
Some time went by, and I never got another computer related problem from him. I went to see him again, and to my surprise, found him cursing at his laptop. He tried to install a new driver for his graphic card, and somehow it messed up his entire installation. Before I could even say anything about what might work, he grabbed the installation CD I gave him a while back, and reinstalled Ubuntu. When done, he himself managed to install VLC, a torrent program, and everything else. He basically installed his laptop. Some errors popped up, and he immediately went to Google to search for a solution. He fixed the errors himself, with me not having to do anything.  
I was so goddamn proud. This was a guy who just a month ago, didn't even know what a terminal was. And now he was reinstalling his PC, and fixing dependency issues in Ubuntu like a pro.

Sgt_Carter,9,14,1ohue9,61,"Well, let me tell you the story of an old-new recruit. Gets hired, told the processes, who to ask for what, and whatnot.

Let's call him Zeb. Zeb has what you might call a posture problem, but that's not his fault because his backbone is made out of jello. Policies? Procedures? No, if the user calls and says it's ""important"" or ""a rush"" or ""a priority"", those go out the window. 

Let's start with the first time I noticed this. Now, recently we've been taking over a new system of support, mainly phone-phone support. That is to say, we fix or have replaced defective or misprogrammed phones. So first we troubleshoot with the user, if that doesn't work we either speak with the people who have been working with the system for 20 years or send it to a telecom tech if it's an obvious physical problem.

Simple, right? Wrong. Zeb likes to please people. Next-day response time on a non-critical phone upsets some people, they want it fixed now. Well, the only phones that get repaired same day are critical phones or if the phone gets reported before 10AM. If it's after 10AM, the tech has moved on and may not be able to come back the same day.

Instead of explaining this and sending it off, Zeb decides to get *creative*. Oh lawdy. 

He first tries calling the on-site tech to bully him into coming same day saying it's a ""critical phone""! (They always are critical. Always.) So the tech rushes over, finds out it isn't a critical phone and charges the standard $200 fee for a rush job and calls to give me an earful. 

One of those 20 year ladies (Jenny) takes the time to talk to him and explain why we can't send this kind of a call as rush if it doesn't show up on the list. 

Zeb: ""Yes, but the user said it was critical."" 

Jenny: ""If it's not on the list, it's not critical.""

So, *that's* sorted out. 

Then he gets another call, the day after. He starts being *creative* again. He tells the person to find another phone that *is* critical and give him that number. The user gleefully runs off to do that, comes back with another number and, lo-and-behold, it is a critical number!

So Zeb sends it off. Never mind that the critical phone is in another room, isn't the same phone model at all, is a digital vs analogue phone, and that THIS PHONE IS NOT CRITICAL. No, let's forget that, because we need to get that phone fixed today, right?

So of course the tech runs up carrying a thousand dollar phone, find that the phone is working fine, then gets directed to replace the tiny $20 plastic phone that is not on the critical list. He blows a gasket, calls me and gets upset for sending him up here on this wild goose chase, charges $200 and leaves.

Jenny goes to see him again and tell him to stop sending these calls. 

He keeps on doing it. Another coworker, let's call her Mabel tells him other stuff, he ignores her.

Turns out he also, besides having a backbone made of jello has a neck made of iron and doesn't like taking direction from women. Because as soon as any woman tells him what to do, he calls in the (male) boss and asks him the exact same question, in front of the lady. He just looks at her and says the same thing, she nods and he confirms it.

dalgeek,43,25,1ohmdw,174,"As a voice engineer I get to work on fun projects like replacing ancient PBX phones with new shiny IP phones.  Of course I always get the ""OMG this phone is so different I don't know how any of it works"", so I try to explain ""Yes, it's new and has a pretty screen, but at the end of the day it makes phone calls and has the same buttons as your old phone, just in different places.""  I even do an hour long training class on basic phone functions like how to place a phone call (""Dial the number, pick up the handset"") and how to answer a call (""When the phone rings, pick up the handset.  If you have two lines, press the flashy light then pick up the handset"").  One time I even got feedback that the training class was ""too technical"".  Really?  The most complicated topic in the class was how soft keys work.  How do these people cope with smart phones?

Anyway, I used to think that was the worst it could get, then I ran into a user who just blew my mind.  On the first day of phone roll-outs I make sure I'm on-site to answer questions directly and resolve any system issues as quickly as possible.  I was checking up on a user and she complained ""I pick up the phone but there's never anyone there"".  Huh.

Me: (leaning over to see the monitor) Well, you need to mark yourself ""ready"" in the agent software, otherwise you'll never get a phone call.

User: How do I do that?

Me: Click on the green button. (I get a blank stare so I point to the screen where the green button is.  The only green button in the application.)

The user clicks the green button and the phone immediately starts ringing because there's half a dozen people in the hold queue.  She picks up the phone and starts talking, but she picked up the wrong line (didn't push the flashy button).

User: There's no one there.

Me: You need to push the flashing light to pick a line.

User: &lt;blank stare&gt;

Me: The flashing light .. push it.

By time she gets back to looking at the phone, the 12 second time limit to answer the call expires and the call goes away, so she's talking to dead air again.  I now have to explain how to push the green button again.  Of course the phone immediately starts ringing ..

Me: OK, push the flashing button.

User: &lt;pushes button and looks at me&gt;

Me: Ohhkayyy now pick up the handset.

User: &lt;picks up handset and looks at me&gt;

Me: &lt;trying not to bang my head on the wall&gt; You can talk now, the caller is on the line ..

She goes about greeting the caller (finally) and gets to the point where she needs to look something up, so she tells the caller to hold then proceeds to place the handset down on the desk.  I whisper to her ""You should put the call on hold or mute"" and she replies (after a blank stare) ""Why would I do that?""  I almost facepalmed at this point but that wouldn't be professional, so I had to explain why hold/mute should be used.

I stuck around for a couple more phone calls and it took all of my self-control to not say something that might get me canned from the project.  The on-site IT support people were on the other side of the cubicle wall shaking their heads and trying not to laugh as they heard the exchange.  It amazes me how the simplest change can cause so much chaos and confusion with users.

s2762679,18,19,1ohclc,142,"Another tale from my experience at a college in the IT help desk.

Let's call this user Power Hungry (herein PH).

PH is the assistant to the Chief Operating Officer (COO). She does things like field his calls, book appointments, and as in this tale, order new computers for him when he asks.

And so the tale begins;

Our contract for computers is with a provider that sounds like Taco Bell.

In our purchasing agreement, Taco Bell can custom make Tacos for us, or we can purchase a ready built one (off the shelf). For Taco Bell to make a custom Taco, it takes up to twice as long to be built and delivered. We're looking at a 3-4 week lead time for build and delivery, then another few days of imaging and install of our SOE after we get our hands on it in our IT deparment.

All in all it is a pretty straightforward process with clearly defined workflow on the initial purchase form. It works like this;

1. User fills out purchase request and is signed by an approving officer (in this case the COO).
2. User then follows instructions on the purchase order form and submit to Taco Bell for a quote.
3. Taco Bell reply with a .pdf quote, this is printed and attached to the purchase form. 
4. Purchase form is sent to Finance department for approval (as instructed on the bottom of the form, directly under where it says sign, it says ""must be submitted to finance after quote is provided in order to release funds for purchase. Any delay in this submission will result in a delay in purchase."").
5. The new Taco is delivered, IT set it up and all is well in the world.

Pretty simple instructions, right? Wrong. PH found a way to stuff this up and here is the email chain that followed; - note, her emails are all in caps lock, but I hate that, so I have excluded the caps and re-wrote it, almost verbatim (some parts shortened for brevity).

PH: It has been a week since I placed my order with Taco Bell and nothing has arrived! We need this computer tomorrow for an event! Where is my computer!?

Me: Hi PH, you mentioned you placed this order a week ago, you are aware that it can take up to 3 or 4 weeks to actually get the machine from Taco Bell?

PH: That is ridiculous, your IT department reports to the COO! We need the computer now!!

Me: Ok, let me look at the workflow, do you have your reference number?

PH: ref######## (note this does not look like a reference number for a purchase, but rather a trouble ticket with our IT department).

Me: ~checks work notes attached to ref#######; now this is where the steps I outlined earlier come into play. PH got the form signed, got the quote, and that was that. The reference number was generated because she emailed the form and quote to us at the service desk, not the finance department. The order was never placed for purchase with finance. Furthermore, there are several email replies, and documented phone calls, advising PH of this which she ignored. I go back to PH with this;

Me: Hi again PH, I have some unfortunate news. I checked the records and spoke with our other staff members here, and it appears as though not only did you only submit the form last week when the form states you must allow up to 4 weeks, but you also did not submit it to finance - you gave it to us - we replied and tried to call you to advise it needed to go through your finance department but you ignored us. As a result, nothing has happened. No computer has been ordered. We could offer you a spare to tie you over in the mean time if that helps?

PH: Are you kidding me!? IT reports to the COO! You have no idea...

Yes, she even left the open ended threat there.

We go to our boss with this to cover our asses, and our boss laughs. Apparently PH has a history of these sorts of shenanigans because she is a pumped up secretary (self-entitled assistant) for a director, she thinks she has super powers to bend the space time continuum and turn an order that will take 4 weeks into 4 days. 

We do the leg work and go to finance with the order, let the COO know directly of PH's total lack of ability to follow simple instructions, and sit smugly whilst PH is reprimanded for ""behaving in a manner that is intimidating and threatening to a staff member.""

In hindsight we could have forwarded onto finance for PH, but really I see myself as an IT educator - not an IT bitch - I'll help you as long as you are willing to help yourself. I'm not here to do your work for you, and if you ignore my emails you will suffer the consequences. Plus this way you will learn and the same thing won't happen again. Furthermore, if you are incompetent at your job hopefully you'll just be fired.

TL;DR - executive assistants are now being hired with the ability to bend space and time, and our campus food sucks compared to Taco Bell...

I handle part of the mobile division, meaning that I do Android development and help select and support smartphones and tablets. We've started the process of issuing tablets to our drivers for them to use for logging and eventually other purposes as we develop applications. By we I mean me. But I digress.

I got a text a little while ago from a driver that is beta testing some software. He had my number in case something with my software went wrong, not for general issues but we know how that goes.

His message stated he had locked himself out of his tablet. Okay it happens. Forgot the pin or whatever. I then spend 15 minutes fighting my laptop to get online (need to clean install Windows...). Finally I log in (while he's texting me every few minutes for status updates..) and find a lovely message the gist of which said: the user removed it. So I text him saying as such and he responds, ""Well I didn't do it on purpose.""

Bullshit I say. It's a roundabout pain in the rear to remove it on purpose. I don't know how you can remove it on purpose. My guess is he wanted to install some app or something that we don't allow (our whitelist only has weather and one game other than the apps needed by the user) and found that Maas360 was blocking it. Then found that Maas locks the device when the user tries to remove it.

Technically I could unlock it, but I decided to make him wait until tomorrow.

I just got another text saying he unlocked it somehow. Now I'm scared.

mallorywilkerson,27,24,1oflir,93,"I recently was moved from my School District's main IT office to a position that deals mostly with Nutrition Services. My School District is TINY so I personally don't know why Nutrition needs their own person, but I have a lot of idle time and no one minds.

Anyway. I managed to convince the Director of Nutrition (My boss in this scenario) to buy all new computers for the kitchens and offices. The old computers were absolute shit, and the old person who used to be a sub kitchen worker/untrained IT person with no fucking standards. *Naming convention, what's that? Tape a monitor together instead of replacing it with one of the five in my office? That's just how I roll.*

Whatever, that's happening. I'm almost done. Just one school left to replace, and two office computers, which is great because it's fall break and I have tons of time. Nutrition Assistant Director emailed last Monday to tell me to work with the old ""IT"" slug of a woman to set these up:

**Mallory and Slug,**

**With the schools out next week I would like the two of you to work together to get the new computers installed at the sites. I realize we are waiting on the RJ6 cables but I am hopeful that they will be in by next week. Please send me a list of schools that still need replacement so I can get an idea where we stand. I know Slug is planning on being out on Friday so that gives us Mon.- Thurs. to work with.** 

**Thanks**

We're waiting on these weird RJ-45 to USB cables to come in, but they aren't essential to the replacement process. I replied to tell her I only had one school scheduled to be done this week-all the rest were basically done. (And are done now. I have just one school left, as planned)

No reply.

************************************

To throw some fun into the mix, we're up for some audits, so there's a chef boot camp here Today, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I was notified of it on Wednesday of last week via email, with NO dates or times, or specifics on equipment. 

The Nutrition Services secretary can't get it in her head that I am not part of Central IT, and for some stupid political reasons, can't access their work order system/don't have one of my own. I've told her many times that when she puts in a work order it goes to someone entirely unrelated to me/Nutrition and I have no way of knowing it exists or what it says. 

Well, Secretary put in a work order and I only learned it existed because the IT Guy responsible for the Blah Blah campus emailed her on Wednesday and CC'd me to say:

**Can you please provide a list of what AV equipment you’re looking to use for this training?  The Blah Blah Campus doesn’t have a guest network so I am unable to provide a guest log in at this time.  Can you also provide more info on what is needed here.  If a district computer can be used, it will have access to the wireless network.**

**Thanks**


What the fuck Secretary? I reply to all saying: 

**I'm sorry for the confusion, but we don't need any equipment. Thank you for letting us know about the guest network** 

(It has always been this way-No guest network at Blah Blah Campus. Always, since the schools were built, and I worked in Central IT.)

Directly after that I got another email from Nutrition Assistant Director:

**Mallory**

**Did you make a plan with Slug to get all of the schools replaced next week?**

**Let me know**

I emailed back to say I actually didn't think we'd have anything to work on together, because I've done all but one simple school.

Fucking crickets for two days. I plan on coming in on Monday at my usual 6:30 am time and setting up for the 7:30 am meeting time (that I only found out via someone else's shared Outlook calendar, thank you Secretary). No mention of what's needed so I planned on bringing all I had: my projector, cart, screen, and master key to the classrooms that are kitted out with all this as well. Covering all bases I can. 

6:00pm Friday, two and a half hours after I leave for the day, Nutrition Assistant Director emails:

**Mallory**

**If you haven't already, email Slug with your schedule for replacing school computers next week.**

It was outside usual hours, so I didn't reply.

*******************************************************************

Sunday morning I get woken up by a phone call from my boss. The boot camp came a day early, and they need access to a guest network. I told her:

**Secretary and I got an email from the IT Guy that runs Blah Blah campus saying there is no guest network, but a district laptop can connect to the wireless.**

Thank's again, Secretary. I can always count on you. 

Boss says, **Well, I'll email the Central IT Director to see about that**

She emails the Central IT Director this:

**Hi,**

**I am working with BootCampPeople and DepartmentofEducation today, Monday and Tuesday, they need to have access to the Internet.  Per Mallory that is not possible at Blah Blah Campus**

**is that true?**

**How can we get them access.  This is that audit and training that I am required to go through.  Please call me in the morning to discuss, I will be here at 5:30am. You can call me on my cell 
(FAK) ENU-MBER**

**Thank you,**

**Mallory's Boss**

I wasn't CC'd on this email or anything I had to find out about it through someone else.

At 7:00pm on Sunday, boss texts to ask me come in an hour early on Monday because the BootCampPeople have moved the time up. Yay. 

She also emailed this nonsense two minutes later in response to an email I sent to only her, on Thursday. It was letting her know I was beginning work on her new computer, and that I planned to install These Programs, could she let me know if I missed anything essential.

**Mallory**

**Nutrition Assistant Director said that you might be able to set up my new work station this week.  Please move everything over that is on my old computer to the new one.  Do not delete anything, we can go over everything next week and remove anything that I don't want.

**I'm not sure I will be able to help... There is no guest network at the Blah Blah campus, how would you like me to go about this?

Let me know what you're thinking.**

**AD Admin/Roommate**

He got no reply that evening despite sending the reply immediately.

****************************************************

Today, I came in at 5:30 am, and realized my ""Outer Door Master"" key works on only one door on the entire building where my office is located (I'm in an office inside a school). I ran around the building until I found a good door, then got my presentation cart and started the walk. The building I needed to be in is one of the five  schools on my campus. It's about 1/4 mile walk through the necessary ramps and paths one has to wheel a cart through. (I like to walk the paths on my breaks, so I tracked it on my pedometer).

I got into the building with the presentation, and wheeled my set up into the conference room to find everything is set up already. So is another classroom. IT Guy ignored my email, set everything up anyway, and neglected to inform me. But one presenter guy did need an 1/8 inch audio cable for sound to come out of this iPod dock he brought with him. 

Now, in this recent department change, my boss supplied me with a desk, some shelves, all those new computers, but nothing else. I asked for other things, and got nothing due to budget constraints. The presentation kit I have is even on loan from central IT. I have NOTHING in my office but the kit, spare keyboards, old monitors and a printer I can shop for parts but was essentially destroyed by a heat box. I tell the presenter I don't have anything on me, but I can try to scour some classrooms in hopes of finding something. 

I didn't find anything. This is probably because the projectors have speakers built in and the teachers use those without fuss, but this guy was just hoping to use his dock and didn't bring a cable with him for whatever reason. 

My boss was upset by this. She then informed that she wants the guest network set up, and that Central IT Director called her at 9:00 pm last night and promised AD Admin/Roommate would have it set up for her. 

I walked my cart back to my building and tried to double checked my office for a cable, but the front doors to my building were still locked and I had to run back around the lawn to the side door and through the gym, like the journey this morning, with the addition of going through the lobby back through the front doors so I could wheel my cart in. Oh they joys of being early.

It's 6:00 am now: two and a half hours before AD Admin/Roommate is supposed to be in.

I text AD Admin/Roommate and ask him what he thinks. Turns out he got this email at 5:00 am from Central IT Director:

**The kindle sounds okay for this time.  Could it be setup with time an expiration date?  Would it work setting them up in the BYOD? (Something to think about). Or should we think about a limited guest login in District Name?  That login could have an expiration date/time?**

**Let's talk with Network Admin about this one today. I am sure as the student center or other buildings at Blah Blah Campus are used more and more for community events this will come up again.**

Now, this Blah Blah campus has been around for years, and school has been in session for months. Why this is a new conversation is due to the Central IT Director having no idea how his department works. Keep in mind, he isn't even talking to the Network Admin in this email. 

AD Admin/Roomate texts me to tell me to get the computer's MAC Addresses and send them to the Network Guy. Network Guy won't be in the office for another 30-60 minutes. It's 6:30 am at this point. I explained to the presenters I can add them to one of our networks but I will need to get their MAC Addresses. 3 out of 5 decline because whatever. I got two people's addresses, and emailed them to the only two people who have the ability to add them: Network Admin and IT Guy for Blah Blah Campus, and I CC'd the Central IT Director. 

I waited for a reply. And waited. Boss was staring at me as if my sitting down and waiting for reply was hindering the process, even though I explained that the Central IT Department doesn't even open its call line until 7:00 am, and their people start arriving between 7:30 and 8:30 am. 

8:00 am I get a text from AD Admin/Roommate saying this is the magical hour they decided to set up a guest network, and here's the password. No official email response from anyone else in the department until 9:52 am.

Presentation ended at 8:00 am. No one told me until I gave them all the password. Luckily it will help them tomorrow and Wednesday, but today I get to look like a fail whale. 

I might be paranoid, but when I have to stand in front of someone who knows me as ""The IT person"" and tell them ""Well, there's actually an IT Department that regulates the buildings and I am not a part of it, so I have no control over this particular situation. They for some reason didn't have a guest network an hour ago, but they have one now, and you can use it. Yes, I no longer need your MAC address."" I feel like people look at me like I'm lying to cover my ass. I mean, the story is asinine. But at least it's mostly over. 

*************************************************

Just before I started writing this I got an email from Assistant Director of Nutrition.

**Mallory,**

**Slug is ready to assist you with replacing all school computers. Where will you start, will it be: First school in alphabetical order?**

I replaced that school first, weeks ago.

campycapper,190,184,1oflip,846,"Well I received a message from a user asking me to update my tales from Bob, the most hated evil bastard teacher ever. So I thought I would share what my last year has been like with him. 


The back story comes into play here. 
http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/xev2e/the_teacher_from_hell/


And when I finally lost my shit at my administration because of them allowing Bob to continue his destructive warpath, here. 


http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/z5ew4/i_hate_bob_part_ii_an_update/



Over the last few years working as an IT guy in a public school system I have witnessed a destructive force of nature that feeds on technology and the tears of IT guys.  The single greatest horrors I have endured have been at the hands of a maniac, who is so self-deluded that he believes he is a God among the technology professionals. He teaches social studies, and his name is Bob. 
I hate Bob. 



I left you last time with the glorious revolution that his technology was going to be pulled from his classroom. Unfortunately that lasted only a very short time. My administration quickly informed me that he is a long lasting and respected teacher and that my soul was worth less when compared to his teaching. So I was forced to replace all of his technology and allow him to begin his process of torment yet again. But to be fair he has learned many new things and has finally left some of his old destructive ways in the past. I have not had a single cable cut in over a year.


So I will begin with the first story, about how he crashed the entire network.  We moved to a new system and I am no longer the network admin, but I still run all the IT work throughout the school I just do not manage that network.  It was a Wednesday and I had just made it home after a long day of teaching/it work/and my second job (They pay teachers and it guys junk so I work other things) when I received a distressed message from the new Network manager. 


His entire domain was crashing because our site was pulling so much bandwidth. I knew exactly what the problem was right away but not before I got blamed for wiring something wrong or using our network to pirate material.  I had to come back to the campus late at night 
so that he could load up my desktop and view what I was running. Of course I had nothing running, I do not pirate nor utilize pirated material at work, as that would be really stupid. After that I made him walk with me to Bob’s classroom. In his infinite wisdom Bob had found a spare cable in his classroom and decided to plug it into the two unused network outlets. (We removed all switches from the classrooms and built a network closet and installed tons of new outlets. It is beautiful) 


So Bob had created a giant loop in the network and crashed the entire domain. This was only the third day of the year. That was only the beginning. 


By the end of the first week I was reminded that Bob has a master key to the entire building, and even at my request it was not taken from him. I have an IT storage closet where my entire wonderful well organized inventory sits waiting to be placed into classroom or utilized throughout the school. It is not a big closet but it is mine, mine, mine!


I had organized the supplies in the closet the day before so that I could install a couple of smart boards and run wiring for projectors. Now I am a bit particular when it comes to technology my cables are organized my drawers are organized and everything is inventoried so that I know where it is and what I have. 


Then comes Bob. 


I do not know if he comes in at midnight in a drunken rage and has a personal vendetta against me or if his mental capacity is limited in another form but he is a nightmare. When I came to work the next morning I immediately went to my closet to grab the well placed supplies for the day and begin work. Went I opened my small IT closet an avalanche poured from its interior. Bob needed a monitor cable and decided he had the authority to grab it out of my closet himself. It was if a tornado had entered into the room got in a fight with a flock of angry ducks and shot with a smoothbore canon.  Cables that were hanging from hooks were in giant knotted balls lying underneath brand new projectors that had computer towers thrown on top of them. Every drawer in my cabinets was left open with the contents appearing as if someone threw my grandmothers mixer on high speed inside them. 


It was chaotic, and he was still without the monitor cable. He stated he could not find it and that I should make it easier for the teachers to find the pieces that they need. I now have a master lock on my closet and a lock on all of my drawers. What boggles the mind on top of the filing cabinet was a tub with clearly marked on side monitor cables. 


But wait there is more. There is always more with Bob. God damn it I hate Bob. 


This is the story of the missing computer, and Bob’s gifting. 


I was called in one days to Bob’s classroom something was not working appropriately which is normal in a school setting  a plugin needed to be updated for the material he was using. As I walked into his classroom I was immediate struck by that feeling that something was off. I just could not put my finger on exactly what it was. Now whenever I am called into a classroom it is without fail more problems than just the initial request. So I expect to spend a good 30 minutes dealing with a variety of “small” problems. Like Bob’s headphones have stopped working so he tried to splice two headphones together so kids can sit on one computer and listen to the same lecture. But as I am sitting on a computer dealing with a broken mouse and failed Java update it finally clicks in me, one of my computers is missing. To be specific the entire setup is missing. 


I immediately grew concerned as no technology is supposed to leave the classroom that I have assigned  without my permission. Now Bob has a habit of giving things to other teachers that he thinks will help them so I assume that he has done this with the computer. When I asked Bob what had happed he informs me that the computer was not working so he gave it to a student to take home and fix. 


Holy hell the words escaped me, I wanted to cuss and raise hell about how incredibly stupid it is to send a brand new computer home to a student or even that it could be dangerous to do that but I am out of energy. Bob has beaten me. I track the student down; he had the computer going on for a week or so. When I finally got it returned the student had removed capacitors from the motherboard and opened up the hard drive and PSU. I never learned what was actually wrong with the computer, as it went straight to the trash. 
Bob will retire in two years. He is old and will hopefully die a few years after that. When it happens I will dance on his grave and decorate his tombstone with cut network cables and broken motherboards.


 May the devil see him in hell where he will be troubleshooting his own stupidity for all eternity. 


I hate Bob.

Mind43dom,16,26,1ofbds,110,"Well let me start with I run a small company in Australia, when I purchased the company they had no website only a Facebook page, so straight away I found a hosting company that offered a small business hosting plan for around $500.00 a year. Linux based virtual server, crappy bandwidth and resources but hey it was working fine, I built a crappy HTML website and set off. 

Fast forward 13 months business has boomed and its time for a face lift, friend is amazing website builder and SEO guru, happy days he did an amazing job, his concern was the crappy server, 5 yr old PHP version and MySQL open to huge amounts of vulnerabilities. I contact my provider and ask them to upgrade me to their private cloud hosting professional package which was $2500.00  a year, I ask for a lead time to do the swap over and if I will see any down time with my email server as this would be critical to my company. I am informed to submit my order and in the notes state to have it rolled over starting on a Friday night so if there was any down time it would not affect the company.

Now comes the fun .......
Monday rolls around and no new server ......, I call them and ask what is happening and I am informed by tech support it is complete...... I login to my server and that's a big nope .... Still on crappy server. 
Then low and behold bang all email clients can't talk to server my business goes black, office staff are ringing me they can't do anything. I call hosting company and am told submit a ticket and we will get right on it......
They said they will have this rectified by Tuesday as to not interrupt our trading any further, ok I am fair guy shit happens. Tuesday rolls on ..... Nope no emails no website no nothing....... This continues with no answers or calls from them until Thursday afternoon when I ring again for the 10th time now and finally see they have moved me to the new server..... Yay or so I thought, we can't access PHP or MySQL there is an error..... Ok submit another ticket and let's play this game again...... Come Monday still no access to PHP or MySQL and I have had enough.

 I call them up and ask them can they please just return my hosting back to the original shitty virtual server and to refund my money for the service they can not provide.

 I am told yeah no worries ill do it right now while your on the phone...... That when the pure hilarity starts when I hear him typing away the dreaded ""oops"" comes out his mouth followed by "" have you done a back up recently "" I just laughed and said ""you fucked up didn't you"" he goes deathly silent .... He deleted the entire virtual machine by accident, these guys are fucking monkeys. After the lols wore down I said "" yes mate I have a backup, did you think I'd trust you guys not to fuck up....."" We both LOL and all is well.

I have nothing against these guys and understand they are underpaid and have a shit job but are decent guys, I asked the question why didn't you guys just mirror my data and copy it to new server make sure it was all running and then do the DNS redirect to which he replied casually "" yeah that would be logical but our sys admins are stoned pretty much every day even though I could have done your swap over in about 3 hours I am not allowed too as I am only tech support level 1""

So, the company in question sells diet food and weight loss products, and they're not Weight Watchers, if that narrows it down. They do a *ton* of business over the phone, driven primarily by a sales floor composed of 90% women, plenty of them no spring chickens either. This high-power force of feminimity starts *early* too, because if it's 4am here in Cali, it's 7 in New York City and time to make some sales.

So at 4am, in the super-spooky darkness of October, they all show up for work to find that nobody's keycards are working: the front door won't unlock. Calls are placed to the building owners, the security guards, etc, all of whom pass the buck off to each other on who's responsible for the doors. By this time everyone is *pissed*, these women can do $10k in business before the sun rises, so right now this company is dropping money faster than their clients want to drop pounds.

Finally someone coughs up that IT has some ability to administrate the door locks. IT is housed in a different building which *is* unlocked, but deserted. (Not a surprise, most tech world people I've known will *stay up* until 4am, but not *get up* at 4am.) But now they're really boned, because there's nobody to reset the doors so everyone can get to their desks and get on their computers to start worki- ....wait.

The way this scene was described to me, one of the women busts out that ""Wonderful Awful Idea"" Grinch face, and points out that IT's numerous computers and phones are in fact *right there.* All of the sales data and other vital information comes from a web interface, so there's no reason work has to be done on your OWN station....

Having personally met most of this group, they are most definitely the type to need multiple walk-throughs on how to do things, never want to click anything unless specifically told to, and ask you what their Gmail password is even if you've never touched it.

KazumaKat,21,42,1ocpup,237,"I was reminded by recent events of a client call years ago. How ""years ago""? Win95 years ago. Yep, its one of those stories from back in the day. Dont worry, this'll not confuse the youngins on here either, because its pretty straightforward but just as intense.

So I get a client call from a referral involving a PSU issue. So I head over and get my ohmmeter out and my backup tester PSU.

What greeted me was not ideal working conditions. There is a pet lizard in an open aquarium to the side of the PC, and the obvious smell of bugspray in the air, enough to make me gag a bit at the start.

So I'm busy testing the PSU, swapped in my tester unit, found out that the connectors on the PSU the client was using were either bad or the rails they're on are going, so I recommended a PSU replacement. Client goes ""ok, but put my old one in before you go, I'll get a new one tomorrow"", and so I did.

During all this time Mr Lizard had a tendency of jumping straight out of his aquarium and landing in front of me. Scared me half to death the first couple of times until the client moved him and his aquarium farther , by about an inch or two. Not enough but at least he stopped jumping into my lap, practically. Strong urge to jump considering his thumb-like size.

One final run with the case side off, everything's running fineish (on new connectors from the PSU, but still recommended to the client to get a new one from a reputable brand), Mr Lizard makes his Final Jump...

...right into a spinning case fan on the side.

Reptillian blood and guts flew everywhere. I screamed, my client screamed, the fan screamed, and then the pop and whines and electrical shock I suffered told me one thing.

The PSU must have been hit with the blood and guts somewhere because the entire thing started emitting the magical smoke of electronics, and immediately tripped the house circuit breaker, plunging us into darkness.

Going home after that case was one part WTF and several parts sick from the experience.

Come to think of it... I didnt get paid for that one :(

mephron,57,132,1oc7ou,565,"So while I was working for Big Bankery Place, my group (Firewall Access) and another group (Messaging Support) were forcibly merged by two groups because ""Well, it's all Internet, right?""

Our group gets access to their Remedy queue and, as one, scream in horror.  And we go to our new manager of the united groups and issue as one a great ""what the fuck"".  See, Messaging Support had tickets dating back to January.

In **June**.  Almost 1300 tickets.  And then we got into their email account for requests, and saw them running back to *November*.  Cue more screaming.

And then the head of Technical Services - our manager's manager - calls a meeting, complaining about it, and saying, ""I'm not risking my bonus because you people are incompetent!""

I kind of lose it.  And I can see my manager's fingers digging into the table.  And I said, ""Your idea was merging the groups, and you did not insure due diligence was done before merging.  Firewall Access has its own queue and email account, and ours are averaging less than one business day time to resolution.  Messaging Support's incompetence and inability to get working is not our problem.""  And my manager's fingers clench more.  And then the meeting gets dismissed.

I get warned that I was on the edge of getting fired.  And that I was getting seconded over to Messaging Support to help them out.  Oh, joy and rapture and maaaaagic.

Thankfully, one of the people in their group is just as mad, and proceeds to help me learn how to operate HP Openmail and do account work on it.  And then I work on it.  8 AM to 10 PM Monday through Friday.  Saturdays, 9 AM to 6 PM.  Sundays I take off to sleep.  Oh: and I'm *hourly*, not exempt.  And my stuff gets signed off on, week after week.

The queue goes down, the email account gets smaller.  I keep going.  Week after week.  The other members of Messaging Support act like I'm crazy, because no one's really complained (except I find the complaints, also that they ignored because they hadn't really looked at the email).

One Thursday in September at 7 PM, I pause, looking at the count of tickets.  I click an icon on my desktop.  And the Alleluia Chorus comes out of my machine's speakers.  MY manager comes over - I didn't know he was there - and says to me, ""What's the occasion?""

I point: 48 tickets.  22 emails. ""I'm going home before 10 on a weeknight for the first time since May.""

I do that.  I eat something that's not delivered.  I take a long, hot shower. And I sleep the sleep of the just.

Mark_Asread,34,52,1obrsi,202,"I was contracting as a web-dev at a Californian media company which was trying to reinvent itself as a digital trend-spotter. They wanted to be the firm with their finger on the pulse of the Kids and how they used the Social Medias.

They wanted a project which would be amazing, lend itself to infographics, and establish them as the Guys Who Really Knew Their Stuff. The MD was going to stand in front of a big crowd about six weeks from now and wow them with some Big Data on a big screen.

Where was the Big Data coming from? They reached out to a local university which liked to get its logo on things like this and conceived of The Great Online Photography Project of 2012. What we were going to do was download and analyse information from a website used by The Kids to share their photos. Let's call it Outstagram.

The university sent along a seriously geeky guy to the meetings. His English was halting and a bit random, but his glasses were impressively thick and his hair was impressively unkempt. Anyone could tell he was a hard-core geek. He had created The System.

This guy, who we'll call — what's a typical Chinese name? We'll call him Nelson. Nelson had apparently devised a way to download all Outstagram's data for the whole of its history (a web-startup-impressive three entire years). All you needed to do was draw a rectangle on a tricked-out Google Map and it would immediately ship you bulk-container-loads of JSON. He talked breezily about downloading whole cities-worth of data.  We would then slice and dice this data to provide amazing insights.  People in San Francisco take a lot of photographs in the morning! People in LA take a lot of photographs in the evening! People in San Diego take 73% of their photographs on the beach! Anyone who so much as mentioned Brand X, a major client, could be identified, cross-referenced with FriendFace and their behaviour tracked in a laughably innocent pre-Snowden-era kind of a way. Who knew what amazing and highly monetizable insights could be drawn from these masses and masses of data?

The only teeny tiny possible problemette I could see with this plan was … it couldn't be done. As soon as I'd got back to my desk, I'd had a look at Outstagram's well-documented API and you definitely couldn't do that. No rectangles. No slurping down of data in bulk (a couple of pages of historical data was considered fair use). There were legal notices saying you couldn't do it. There was documentation saying you couldn't do it. I even saw people asking in official Outstagram discussion groups how to do it and being told definitively that they couldn't, by Outstagram company employees. After all, if you could do that, you could simply take a copy of Outstagram's entire database, which currently had them valued at eleventy-nine squillion dollars.

So, I explained all this to the Project Manager, who said, and I quote, ""Don't come to me with problems, Mark, come to me with solutions"". Nelson must know what he was talking about. I guess I must have misinterpreted the API doco … and the specific legal restrictions … and the terms and conditions and the comments in the forum and, well, all common sense and logic.

I wrote to Nelson and asked him for a sample of the data, preferably from way back in the Cretaceous Period of Outstagram history, or as you and I call it, 2010.

It *probably* should have tipped me off that he sent me the sample data in a .BMP file.

Not a steganographically encoded, innocent-looking BMP file in which the data was surreptitiously interwoven into the wallpaper. A BMP file straight from Paint with screenshot of the JSON data in his Command Prompt window, because he apparently didn't know how to export the data to file by doing `some command &gt; sample.json`.

But never mind, I could read the data and I could see that he did indeed have data from way back in 2010 when dinosaurs roamed the social media earth. Data from a specific location. That ""location"" being the ""San Diego Hair and Makeup Expo June 2010"". Oh great. He wasn't stupid. He was just deluded. Having extracted information by ""location"", and accepting any folksonomic [technical term meaning ""pulled out of your ass""] definition anyone with a smartphone wanted to use for location, he had indeed got information ""all the way back to 2010"". For that one Location which had only existed for three days in the minds of some hairdressers in 2010, he'd got his allotted couple of pages of data and extrapolated from this that he could get any amount of data for any date for any location.

I let the manager know this but, once more, before I'd even finished my explanation of what ""false positive"" meant, I was told not to come up with problems. Only solutions. I was a geek, Nelson was a geek. Talk to him and sort it out.

I tried to take this feedback on board and sat down for a conference with Nelson. Who knows, maybe he'd found a way to game the system. Maybe I was missing something. Let's give the guy a chance. How exactly did his system work?

He started drawing on a legal pad. Take a given rectangle with coordinates A,B top left and C,D bottom right. Now we start looking for Outstagram data. We start at A,B. Is there any Outstagram data found at this point? We grab any available data then we move on. We add one metre to A and start looking for Outstagram data at coordinates (A+1), B. Is there any data at this point? And repeat.

Never has the phrase ""I'm going to stop you there"" been uttered with more trepidation.

""Just to be clear"", I continued, temporarily holding back my urge to weep hot salty tears of despair, ""Your method of processing a given rectangle is to add an enormous number of lat-longs to it and poll Outstagram repeatedly to see if it knows anything about each lat-long? And any given rectangle 1 km by 1 km has precisely 1,000,000 of these dots?"" He nodded cheerfully. Finally I understood the true brilliance of The System. But possibly it would be 1,100,000 because he wasn't sure if it was zero-based or not.

""That's very … thorough. So how long did it take you to download the data for the whole city, the first time?""

You should probably stop reading now if you expect this story to have a happy ending.

Only now, thirty days away from the due date of the project, did I discover that Nelson's System had never actually, not really, not what you'd call truly *run* as such. It had run for about five minutes on his laptop, just to test it out.

Faced with the choice of a) going back to the managers with this new and suicidally depressing information or b) being a Team Player who Came Up With Solutions, Not Problems, I wimped out. We put the system into production. I'm not really a Java guy but I've got the general idea. We rented some cheap Tomcat space from a helpful hosting provider, uploaded a WAR file roughly the size of a Blu-Ray disc, deployed it, drew some conservative rectangles around downtown and hit ""Go"". At least Nelson assured me it was the Go button, because many of the system labels were still in Chinese.

Shortly after this, we got some emails from the service provider. Shortly after that we got some text messages from the hosting provider. And shortly after that we got some phone calls from the service provider. The System was using 317% of its allocated system resources, everything else on that server had ground to a halt, and it had filled up its disk quota after ten minutes. Because of course, of all possible ways to store the data, MongoDB was the best. Straight from JSON to disk, amirite? What could possiblye go wrong?

And this is the moment when I found out that not only hadn't Nelson's system ever really run, but also that it wasn't Nelson's system.

Nelson was more what you'd call a system *Designer*. He'd determined how the Google Maps interface should look and how the information, once retrieved, should be displayed. The guy who'd actually coded the system was another guy who we'll call, oh I don't know, what's another typical chinese name? — Edwin. And Edwin wasn't around. He was in a country we'll call ""China"", because that's its name, for a festival we'll ""New Year"", see above. We weren't sure of his phone number but we definitely had his email somewhere. And in case you missed it, no, The System had never actually run except in very limited tests.

We upgraded the hosting account, then upgraded it again. Twice. We were now on the Double Super Premium Platinum Ultimate Executive hosting plan and still the CPU and disk were barely keeping up. The System, to put it politely, had some issues. 

And more to the point, as management reluctantly began to realise, it wasn't retrieving the data they thought it would, and it never would.

At last, they had come to see I'd been right about this all along. And to their credit, there was an instant and substantive change in their attitude to me. At the next meeting, they didn't say ""Don't come to me with problems, come to me with solutions."" They said ""Can you please let us know all the usernames and passwords for all the systems you've set up or worked on? Thanks."" and scheduled a meeting with HR for 4.30 PM.

Well, I didn't have anything important to do then, so I said let's go fix that sucker. Bad idea. I went to her room, and sat down at her desk and everything was spinning. I'm talking walls turning, voices tuning out, a full-on trip. I took a look at the router and noticed a Post-it (retrospectivly, I'm surprised I even noticed it), with scribbled on it some IP adresses to configure the router, and the network's name. No problemo, just let me connect it to the PC, type in the IP, and... Crap. No game, it can't find the page.  
By now, my addled brain was trying to find out why it couldn't find the page. I checked the cables (barely), checked the power, and everything is as it should be. I try to search the network on the PC, but I can't find it. I check the power again, but it's all there. I say something about ""resetting the router"", and reconnect the power cable.  
""Right,"" User piped in, ""someone else also told me to do that!""  
I managed to ask her who told her to do that. ""The lady at the helpdesk!""  
Wait what?  
""What did you do to reset it, exactly?"" I asked.  
""Oh, I just pressed the button!"" User responded.  
Stoned me thought she ment the power button, so I pay no heed to it, and I continued to try to reconnect to the router, and checking it's power. I was really out of it, so it took me a quite a while to figure out that instead of just pulling out the power cord every time, I could just use the power button. So I started looking for the power button.  
Huh. No power button.  
""Uhm, User, where is the power button you pressed?""  
""Huh? What power button?""  
And here we come to the second part of the problem. I facepalmed internally when she showed me how she resetted it. With a paperclip. Folded open.  
You see what I'm getting at here? Oh yes, she resetted the router alright. By pressing the reset button.  
Goddammit.  
Now, I must admit, I was rather defeated by a mere wireless router. I blame it on being in a higher atmosphere, but that doesn't change the fact that I failed miserably.  
I apologized I couldn't help her, told her she'd fucked the router, and then apologized because I was in no state to fix this (I wasn't even able to tell the time on my smartphone, and I couldn't remember how to get into a defaulted router). I told her I'd look into it the next day.  
  
Enter the third part of the problem. Convinced I wasn't good enough to fix it, she brought in her ex. Who, she claimed, was also a ""tech wizard"" (so let's call him Mr. Tech Wizard or Mr. TW).  
But even he couldn't figure out the devil's machine. I came in while he was trying to get it to work, and I talked to User a bit about school and other things while he fiddled around. I looked over to the ""tech wizard"" (who was working in IE, what? Firefox is right next to it!), and saw he still wasn't finished. He says it's broken, as he can't connect to the router. I take a closer look and see he has the router connected to the PC, but from the wrong port on the router. By now I was surprised he hadn't installed a Bing searchbar yet.  
I tell him to move, connect everything correctly, connect to the (now suddenly visible) ""default"" network, type in the magic IP, and set the thing up. I test the connection, but I still haven't got a internet connection.  
Mr. ""Tech Wizard"" almost gloated over the fact that I still couldn't get User internet, but that stupid smirk was quickly wiped off his face as I noticed the little yellow triangle next to the wifi bars. No valid IP.  
Alright, I opened up the properties of the wirelss adapter, and checked the IPv4 properties. And there was the problem right there. Mr. TW changed the default IP to 192.168.0.1, in the hope it would magically connect to the router. I switched to automatically obtain IP, and suddenly Google was able to pop up. Glory for me, ignoring ex-GF for Mr. Tech Wizard.
Looking back, I do think that I cockblocked that guy who was hoping to score some merit points with his ex, but then again, don't say you can fix it if you have no idea what you're talking about.

HereticKnight,12,13,1obnlt,83,"Short time lurker, first time poster. This story is not one of use error, it's about the mistakes we occasionally make.

Background: In college, I had worked the campus' helpdesk and through hard work, eventually became the lone assistant to our two-person desktop systems team. This meant that even though the college paid me the standard student worker wage of $9/hour, I had admin access to the web interface that gave us full control of all the campus' machines in order to do my job.

One of my first unsupervised assignments was to go to one of our labs and run a script on the machines there. It could be done remotely but involved rebooting later in the process, so I needed to make sure any students saved their work. I arrive, open up the web interface, and start carefully preparing the command I needed to run. You can see where this is going.

One of the fields is, of course, the name of the script to run. I type in the first few letters and it suggests the possibilities. I tap the down arrow a few times, and, without thinking, tapped 'Enter'. For a moment, I saw the page that said 'Command Confirmed', then the computer began to reboot. I look around. Every other computer in the lab is rebooting as well. The command I wanted didn't cause a reboot. Oh Fuck. What did I do?

Then, it hits me like a blow to my gut. A memory floated to the forefront of my thoughts. It was of the command page and, near the bottom, a small checkbox, calmly labelled 'Apply to all machines'. It is selected by default. I couldn't remember if I had unchecked it.

*Heart Attack Mode: Engage*

Immediately, visions of unemployment were upon me. Thousands of computers could be effected. The daemons had been given their orders to follow without question and it was too late to stop them. Had I, in a moment of weakness, unleashed damnation upon the campus?

I sprint into a neighboring room and no rebooted to be seen. Fortunately, I had already told the page to only run on the machines in the one lab and had unchecked the evil checkbox of evil.

Equally fortunate was that everyone in the lab had saved their work recently, so no data was lost. The command I had given was the first one on the list of potential commands, which was simply to reboot with the mouse and keyboard disabled. No damage done and easily reversible. I gave myself a minute to catch my breath and fixed everything without further incident.

That incident made me far more careful in dealing with the interface and ultimately made me a more deliberate, better, worker. I never had another incident like that again and was praised for my good work that followed. Better to screw up small early than screw up big later, right?

**TL;DR**  Pressed a wrong key while using a campus-wide administration tool. Just about anything could have happened and the vast majority of them would have been terrible, but I lucked out and only reboot the machines in the lab I was in. Also, it's a poor design choice to have scripts default to executing on every machine at once.

Anyway, I know you guys must have interesting tales to share. Free humility for all!","We don't goof often, but when we do...",96

- - - - -

Two weeks into my new job, and already I was slammed with things to do.

Our ticket queue was at 100 on any given day, which was fine. We usually had it reduced to 60 or less at the end of the day as is between me and the other office-based tech. A lot of it was the techs using it as a reminder system for work they were doing, too.

One of our major clients, a religiously affiliated high school, had ordered 451 - yes, 451 - Dell Latitude 10-ST2E slate PCs (x86-based Windows 8 Pro tablets) without consulting us.

Us.

Their IT firm.

ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)

Nevertheless, we got in on it, and ripped their Dell rep a new one for telling them that one of the big points only available in Win8 Enterprise would be in Win8 Pro. As a result, Dell comped us a MAK for 1000 Win8 Enterprise licenses, plus the services of a project firm to get all the tablets reimaged and deployed.

It fell to me to get the image created, and after a night of cursing and swearing, since they were UEFI-only, and couldn't boot to PE3 or Win7 off their flash drives - and yes, I tried a lot. UEFI only likes signed things and FAT32 - I cursed, swore, and built a WinPE 4 boot USB with the Win8 installer and all the drivers slipstreamed in. An hour later, I had my install, and over the next day, I nurtured and crafted it into an image for the tablets, complete with pervasive branding (lock screens, Default user profile branding, default home pages, et cetera). Office 2013 Enterprise was installed (again, 1000-activation MAK. So nice), the programs they wanted (GloBible and a few others) were installed, and I tweaked the HELL out of it to go even faster than it should.

When I was satisfied with the gold master image, a Dell tech and I sat down the next morning, created a WIM from it, and split it to allow it to fit on the FAT32 flash drive (booting via UEFI, remember?). 6GB isn't half bad for a Win8 image, especially with Office installed. We handed it off to the imaging company, confident that they'd fuck it up somehow.

BOY, WERE WE RIGHT.

We got them back, and there had been a second local admin account added. No matter, we thought, we'd fix it.

Then we found out that the faculty and administration wanted a whitelist for the Windows Store.

This isn't possible, normally. Sure, Applocker will let you block apps from running or downloading, that's fine. We had our GPO in development for that. They didn't want them to even SEE apps that are PG-13 or higher on the store (T or higher, for you ESRB people). This had never been done... supposedly... and wasn't even supported by Microsoft.

Sure enough, some sysadmin in North Carolina had done it for his district, and Dell was desperately trying to hire him. We got in contact with him to mirror his setup, which worked pretty well. It also implemented, by the by, web filtering.

At any rate, I digress.

The tablets were imaged, rolled out to the students at the high school, and on launch day, we disabled the local admin accounts on the PCs via a single psexec command (psexec \\@assetlist.txt net user LOCAL_ADMIN_NAMES /active:no), where assetlist.txt contained the list of every tablet name (exported from AD as CSV, copypasta'd from Excel into Notepad). Due to a scheduling quirk and the sysadmin who was supposed to apply it being out for a few days, we didn't have the AppLocker whitelist GPO rolled out, but we had the Windows 8 management VM in place with the whitelisted apps installed, and the GPO was configured and ready to be linked.

I was sitting at the office, listening to Tears for Fears on Pandora and enjoying coffee, and the school's tech called me in a panic. ""Jack, what's going on there? Kids are downloading apps here! They've got Angry Birds on some tablets, I've seen Netflix on others, and one kid has pulled 4 gigs over the Internet connection! Didn't you roll out AppLocker yet?""

I sighed and got up from my chair. ""Cool your shit, Skeezix. I'm on my way to the high school, I'll see you there in 20."" A few clicks later, I was in the management VM, inside the Group Policy editor. I linked the GPO to the Student Tablets OU, then thought about something.

""GPupdate takes too long to check in and apply."" I tapped a finger on my chin. ""I have an idea.""

After a quick drive to the school, I met with the tech in the cafeteria, where lunch was being served. The kids were crowded around the ones who'd gotten their tablets, and a few were watching Netflix (one even had Breaking Bad on. I resolved to torrent that show when I got home that night). The tech was running his hands through his hair in frustration, and I smirked.

""So, what are we going to do?"" he said, resignation evident in his voice. ""They're saturating the Internet connection.""

""Well, it's easy,"" I replied, launching 2X on my phone and RDPing into the management VM, which I'd left a dialog box up on. ""The GPO is deployed and linked, it's active. We need them to check in and update the GPO. The easiest way is to take the tablets and restart them. That's not an option for these over-privileged little brats, though - remember what happened last week when we locked out all Apple devices thanks to them oversaturating BOTH Internet connections downloading iOS 7 on release day?""

At his nod, I flipped my phone around him and showed him the window up on the VM.

""Jack... what does 'shutdown -i' do?""

The target machine dialog had the list of every deployed tablet, and the message ""AH AH AH, YOU DIDN'T SAY THE MAGIC WORD"" in the comment field, with it set to restart with no warning to the users.

""Push the button, Frank,"" I said with a smirk, ripping off Dr. Forrester, and he tapped the OK button and kicked off a restart on every tablet in the school.

A minute or two later, the students were in an uproar when their tablets restarted... and the non-whitelisted apps - Netflix, Pandora, and the like - returned the message ""This app has been blocked by your system administrator.""

We stepped over to the microphone and speaker system that I'd asked the tech to bring in there before I arrived, and tapped the mic to ensure it was live.

""Attention, students,"" I said, my voice echoing over the cafeteria. ""We apologize that your tablets rebooted without warning and that you didn't have a chance to save your work."" The last word was said with clear snark. ""Please note that when your parents signed the agreement to let you all have the tablets, you agreed not to install applications. As such, we've just removed that temptation from you, since some of you can't be trusted. You know who you are.""

The clamor and rage-filled yells started up. ""We also would like to point out that the agreement included you all not trying to bypass security restrictions. So think twice before you try to do what we know you're going to try to do. I guarantee we'll know.""

I clicked the mic off, tossed it to the campus tech, and walked out of the cafeteria with the wailing and grinding of teeth of several hundred entitled whiny iPhone-wielding teenagers behind me.

*You know, I could get to like this job,* I thought. *I've never gotten to drop a mic before.*

SkraeNocturne,2,16,1o8zjs,53,"For the last couple of months, I've been working on getting some alerts in LabTech set up (it's been taking so long due to the ticket volume at our current client).  One of the features my boss really wanted was an automated phone call when the hard drive space of a server was below 20%, then another below 10%.

I finally got voice messaging set up last week, and this week I set to work on crafting the alerts, and got really excited yesterday when LabTech called my cell phone (set up on a ""contact card"" in LabTech specifically for me), and planned to stagger deployment of the alerts on all of our clients' servers, so as not to flood the phone system of our answering service in the event that some of the servers were already past the threshold.

I come into work today, excited to finally get the project ticket out of my queue, and noticed that there was a contact card in the system for ""Monitor Alerts.""  Awesome, I notice that the number on the card is the same as the one that we call from, so I change it accordingly as LabTech doesn't let you call the number you're calling from.  Everything should be good.  I relax and pat myself on the back.

Shortly thereafter, we start getting emails from the answering service a few hours later stating that they've received a ton in the last few hours, and they want to know what's going on.  This didn't get back to me until about 2 hours ago.  I change the contact number to my cell phone and wait for a call.  

One comes in, and I listen to it.  Strange, that's not the alert that I set up...  I get the gist of what the alert was set up to monitor and the machine it's running against, so I check the monitors tab of that machine.  Huh, there's no monitor here for that.  I managed to accidentally click the scripts tab and notice one that seems to match the call.  Turns out that there are a bunch of scripts set up in the system to create alerts, including alerts that include automated phone calls.  Oh dear, lets change the number back since the alerts are not set up to be very friendly to the human ear, both in terms of frequency and syntax.

OfficerNelson,63,65,1o8vfm,336,"This is a bit of a nontraditional angle on tech, but the job is called ""theater tech"", so have fun reading.

I currently work in a theater as a lightboard operator. This means I get to generally forego the pains of dealing with customers; so much so that I sit in a black room and most of the time play video games with the soundboard op. The job is *supposed* to entail two things: programming the board during tech (not as fun as you think - the lighting designer literally tells you the commands you need to put in) and running the board during shows (again, not as fun as you think - modern lightboards run ""cue sheets"" which allow you to press GO whenever the stage manager says ""go"", and it handles fades, scrolls, etc. automatically)

During pre-show, the most exciting part of my job occurs - dimmer check. This means, in essence, gambling with the theater gods to see if any of your lights are burnt out today. One particular day about a week ago, I run the dimmer check, and joy of joys - all of the lights were working. This means it's time to weasel out of vacuuming the floor, cleaning the green room, etc. by setting up my laptop and poking around TFTS until the soundboard op gets to the booth and we can fire up some Civ IV.

Typically, a booth operator can see the show by way of a window. For this show, the theater arrangement was flipped backwards, so the set was directly obstructing our view. As a result, everything we did required the assistant stage manager (ASM) to report everything over the headsets. As with every night, my dimmer check involved two things - pulling up all lights and going down to check them all, then pulling up each channel individually and the ASM reports ""good"" or whatever problem there is for each one.

Tonight, though, something went horribly, terribly, atrociously wrong.

The soundboard op and I get through the first cues and he's screwed me over by surrounding me with cities within the first few turns. All of a sudden, the stage manager (SM) comes on headset and whisper-screams that the scrollers are showing green. Bad news. Very bad. (Color scrollers are boxes where the color gel overlay would normally go which runs through a stitched-together series of different color gel overlays, so different scenes can have different color washes without multiple lights or expensive LED cans.)

I check the cue sheet, the scrollers should be red. Indeed, the board is outputting the correct color code. I confirm with the ASM that they were running correctly during dimmer check (they were). I try to bump the scrollers back into the right color - no luck. Remember, I can't actually see the scene, so I have no idea what is going on, and the soundboard op is waiting for me to finish my turn.

There is no scene where the scrollers are green. I can only imagine the poor, confused actors roaming around in a sea of green reserved for the strangest of shows. (In fact, I've never seen it used. Ever.) But lest we not forget the #1 rule bestowed on me as a lightboard op - **never** fuck with the lights during a show. My predecessor didn't heed this warning and accidentally overwrote the patch data, plunging the whole theater (including the lobby) into total darkness during a show until a backup could be restored.

So there I sat, too scared to break the rule, and too worried to sit around doing nothing. I kept frantically scrolling through cue sheets, patches, channels, everything, trying to see if there was something that wasn't right. Nothing.

Intermission arrived. The ASM broke out a ladder and climbed up to check the scrollers. While up there, he confirmed that the power was on, indicated by an LED on the back. Still, no luck.

We considered the fact that the motor might have burned out, but that wouldn't explain why all would have burned out at the same time. Regardless, we broke out some replacements, plugged them in, and tested - no dice.

At this point, we were desperate. The audience was mingling its way back in (I heard that one particularly tough customer had demanded her money back for the botched performance). I was told we would have to disable the scrollers for the remainder of the show, which would leave us with only white. Not much better.

Then, the ASM had the bright idea of sending me back into the patch room and check the cables. This is a cramped room where all of the wires from the lights get plugged into individual dimmers, which are chained together into a series of DMX splitters, which are then sent to the board - basically a network, although unidirectional. And in a 6x6x4 ft room, not conducive to human visitors.

So, let's start checking cable connections. Never mind the fact that people are waiting for the show to resume - we've got to reseat every possible cable (since the master electrician failed to provide any sort of documentation on which cables are which patches).

A good 10 minutes later, I crawl out, covered in dust, cobwebs, and a variety of unspeakable substances, only to find that all of my work was for naught. Up to the booth I trek, defeated and helpless. I reluctantly parked the scroller lights at 0 and we continued the show. Fortunately, I was spared the horror of the nonworking color wash, although I still lost that damn Civ round.

Fast forward one last time to post-show. The audience is pouring out, equally disappointed in my failed handiwork. The stage manager begins to berate me, but in a Hollywood-quality show of depressed self-disappointment, I subconsciously convince him to leave me be while I carry out what I secretly believed to be my final post-show duties.

Cue ASM. ASM is not so pleased, but not how I had expected him to be.

**ASM:** You don't know what the hell you're doing and I've had enough of it. We'll be bringing in a new op for tomorrow's show. $technical_director will call you tomorrow.

**Me:** I recall you were the one who advised me that the scrollers were working. From my position, I was under the impression that there were no problems.

**ASM:** Just do your post-show and get out.

I wasn't going to let it go that easily. This was a competitive job, given the high salary and our job requirements (play video games and push a button every few minutes) which was much more appealing than those of the burger flippers across the street earning $7/hour. I refused to be fired for something that I could not even see was happening.

Post-show done. I call up the master electrician for the show. After yelling at me for a few minutes for waking him up (it was around 1 AM), this occurred:

**Me:** We had a problem with the scrollers. None of them were running.

**ME (capitalization matters, kids):** Did you check the board?

**Me:** Everything was working.

**ME:** And you checked the power and patches?

**Me:** At the expense of my clothes, yes.

**ME:** So the scrollers are on, they're plugged in, and they're not scrolling.

**Me:** That's right.

**ME:** Good luck then. $handset_state=ON_HOOK;

Great. Time to face the music, I guess. Post-show duties having been completed, I headed down backstage to check in with the ASM for anything else, not sure whether my termination had already taken effect (ASM didn't have the authority to do so, so I assumed not).

Upon reaching the ASM's post, I noticed something strange - an orange extension cord hanging down against the wall, unplugged. It didn't dawn on me until the ASM walked back and picked up his phone - followed by a white cable, terminating with a small white box in the wall socket next to the unplugged extension cord. Could it *really* just have been that simple? And the ASM already checked the power, it was clearly on during intermission. But then I realized - the ASM checked it using a flashlight. Those LEDs aren't designed to be bright (since they're on when the theater is pitch black). If the ASM, in his infinite wisdom, shined the flashlight on the LED... no, he couldn't have been *that* dim.

**ASM:** You can go. Bye.

I wasn't going to leave so easily. I calmly walked around him, reached down, and unplugged his phone, which prompted some serious complaints until I plugged the extension cable into the wall and the beautiful crinkling sound of scrollers scrolling echoed around the now-empty theater. Then, after a good 10 seconds of angered frowning at him while he slowly progresses from bitching to enlightened, there was an even more thrilling sound, which rocked me straight to my maliciously spiteful core:

**ASM:** ... ooooh.

I smiled, nodded once, and left.

I have yet to receive any call from the tech director.

We had sites all over North America, and most likely have expanded worldwide by now, I've kind of lost track.


Anyways, our policy is when one of our customers was the target of a DDoS attack (which happens far more often than most people think), we shut down the target IP because we have a responsibility to everyone else on our network, which is now pretty much unusable.  This causes some consternation to say the least.


My most memorable encounter was a massive inbound attack on this one guy's server.  It's coming from multiple spoofed IPs so it's impossible to block the source.  We blocked the traffic's destination and gave him a call to tell him what's up (or down).  He's ok with it, but calls back every 5 minutes asking for updates.  He's getting worse and worse as time goes on.

15 minutes in, he starts muttering.

20 minutes in I can hear his voice shaking.

At 25 minutes, he's on the verge of a panic attack.  This is his sole source of income, and it's like it's gone forever.  I need to get this guy calmed down.

""Sir."" I speak calmly, ""can I ask you a question?""

""What is it?"" he asks in between near-hypervental gasps

""Are you on fire?""  My lips moved before my mind could step in.  It's too late now, we have to press onward with this foolproof plan.

The client pauses.  ""What?  Of course I'm not on fire.  Why would you ask that?""

""Because it may seem bad right now, but I guarantee this will pass.  It could very well be worse.  For example you could be on fire.  If it lasts much longer, we'll find a way to circumvent it.""  I go on with the customer and explain that he has his health and whatever is going on can be fixed if the problem doesn't go away.


Eventually the attack dies off and access to the server is restored.  All is well, but my boss and I discussed proper ways to calm clients down for future incidents.

randommusician,24,17,1o8pya,81,"Anyone who has spent a reasonable amount of time around theater people has probably come to the realization that, at least from their point of view, every theater anyone has ever performed in is haunted in some way.  
   
  
This theater was no exception- it was a tiny theater on the second floor of a late 19th century brick house, the bottom part of which had become a bar. 
   
 
The show in question was my first show with this particular theater company, but the second show I had played for (I'm a pianist) at that particular theater, so I was already familiar with the ghost.  
   
 
The spirit seemed to like to manifest himself in the theater's lighting system.  Periodically, either during a dress rehearsal or performance, something would randomly happen to the lights.  Sometimes the house lights would come up, sometimes there was a complete blackout, and sometimes the lights would change to a random cue from no discernible part in the play.  People had tried everything over the years, from reinstalling the software used to do the light cues to straight up replacing the computer, but to no avail.  We clearly had a haunting on our hands, not a technical issue.
   
 
It is also worth mentioning that the technical director/managing producer for this particular production was a girl we'll call Sarah.  
   
 
Sarah and I soon became rather taken with one another-I with her because I have a terrible weakness for redheads and her with I because of my dashing good looks and roguish charm (Or perhaps because she had been giving most of her spare time to a semi-professional local musical production for several weeks at this point so I may have been the first male who was more of a cat person than a dog person she had been in close contact for a while, if you know what I mean).  Sarah also happened to work in a technical capacity for a hotel, so she knew a bit about troubleshooting computers.
    
 
Midway through the first act of the third performance, with no one anywhere near the computer with the lighting software on it, the house lights come up, seemingly of their own free will.  (It's worth noting that the light cues were done manually for this show, not run on a timer).  
 
 
   
Out of purely technical interest, I assure you, Sarah and I bravely volunteered to stay after the show and investigate the problem, taking our chances alone in the room with the ghost.  
   
 
After many attempted fixes and much googling, we are finally able to locate the problem.  After a little over 432,000 seconds of run time (5 days), the lighting program would crash itself, going to the ""default"" whoever had programed the lights for that show had set- either house lights, a blackout, or possibly the first scene they had created the lights for during tech week.  
 
   
Turns out that no one had ever thought to turn the computer off between shows, or even to exit the lighting program.   
  
 
**TL;DR** I am thy father's spirit,

He often regales me with stories of his previous positions where he managed an entire factory of chemical production and knew all of the science behind it, and of how he used to work on submarines and knew every single mechanical function behind them.

His genius extends to troubleshooting when he can't get an email to go out. Every time he tries to send something, Thunderbird gives him an error that says he timed out from the SMTP server.

His conclusion? The only answer must be that the file he's attached to the email is corrupt.

He explains to me that he opened the PDF and tried to print it, and it gave him an error, so the file must be corrupt. Gasp!

I ask him to show me his troubleshooting process. As you have probably guessed, the truth of the matter is distorted by his aura of genius.

He opens the PDF document and prints it. The printer whirs and spits it out. He closes the PDF and it asks if he wants to save any changes. He clicks ""yes"" and it gives him an error. 

This error is because the PDF is on a read-only shared folder I set up to prevent him from destroying or editing important documents he needs access to but can't be trusted to not ruin.

One day, the queue was 2 minutes deep, so I picked up a call.  It was a middle aged woman using a web site that provided info that used to be only available via direct snail mail, and she wanted to be able to print it.  Since the page didn't have its own print or print preview link/feature, I advised her how to do that using her own browser, which I could tell was a bit of an inconvenience to her.


Then, she wanted to save the info displayed on the page for her records.  **What site wouldn't let you print a digital form easily?  This one** - It completely integrated the info into this gateway type of page (not even in a separate FRAME/IFRAME), and **it was not available to download as a separate file** (PDF, JPG, etc.)


In a situation like this, **tech support becomes an art where the custom solution or workaround must be crafted with beauty that is in the eye of its beholder** - In this case, a middle aged woman who didn't want to be inconvenienced with technology - A potentially tough critic.  I advised her how to save the info as a HTML web page on her PC.  She wasn't thrilled with that, so she asked me if there was a way she could open the payroll info in an MS Office document.  **So I even showed her how she could attempt to copy the payroll information to a Word document**.  At this point I had no doubt she was tangibly frustrated with how the formatting was turning out and how finicky text selection was on the web page with the payroll info.


""Can I talk to someone who knows how to do what I want?"", she told me in an annoyed tone.


""Ma'am, I understand your frustration with this process because I've used this web site myself for quite some time, but **I AM the supervisor**.  I happened to answer your call because I saw you were on hold, and I can assure you that I am coming up with the best possible solutions given what we have to work with here.""


""Oh...okay"" she said in slightly meek tone.


I asked her if she had MS Excel, which she did.  So I had her copy &amp; paste the payroll data into a spreadsheet there, and **by the grace of God, she said that this spreadsheet solution would suffice**.


""Anything else I can help you with ma'am?"", I asked in half anticipation that she'd inadvertently self-discover another way this web site wasn't user friendly.


""No, you've been helpful - Thank you"", she said in a pleasant tone before she hung up.

A backup of their entire account is made every night, and we keep one of those backups as well for up to a week, and another for up to a month, so at any given time they have 3 potentially different snapshots of their data that they can download, and that we can also restore from. Totally free. Whenever I get a call about restoring something from a backup because something broke, I make sure to point out this tool and say USE THIS SHIZ, YOU WILL THANK ME SOMEDAY.

Nah, bro - you stop paying for storage space, we stop storing your crap.

Think of it like renting an apartment in a busy college town. Rent is cheap and everything is great. And then think about what happens when you go on a backpacking trip to Europe for 6 months and don't pay your rent. Your landlord probably hauled all of your stuff out so someone else can move in and actually pay rent. Your stuff is long gone, and there is not a thing that your landlord can or will do about it. Yelling at them that those were YOUR belongings and the landlord had NO RIGHT to get rid of them is kind of silly, because it's actually the landlord's property and when you stop paying the rent on it, if you didn't care about your stuff enough to take it to a storage unit or drop it off at your parents house, as far as the landlord knows, you just don't care about your stuff. It's abandoned. If you wanted it, you would have moved it somewhere safe, and that landlord probably has no sympathy for your stupidity either.

**Customer:** Hello, I need you to send me all of the emails from my email account from January 2011 to January 2013.

I check his account. What does it say?

    ""This account was deleted on 02/16/2013 at 12:59:05pm""

    02/16/13 12:59pm - - - - - Automatic Note - - - - - DELETED!

**Me:** I'm sorry, but it looks like your account was deleted in February. My notes show that you contacted our Billing department, requested to cancel, and completed the cancellation form. The cancellation form states ""I agree that I have backed up any important files, and that once I cancel my account, these files will be deleted from my account."" You did that on 2/15/2013. We no longer have any data on your account that we could restore.

**Customer:** WHAT?!?!?!?!?! The last time I contacted you, you said you have these backups:

&gt;Daily Backup (February 10, 2013)

&gt;Weekly Backup (February 6, 2013)

&gt;Monthly Backup (January 14, 2013)

Those files should definitely be able to be restored! Restore them IMMEDIATELY or send me a copy of the backup!

**Me:** I'm sorry, but we do not have any files in your account - backups included. We are not a free storage service. You agreed in the cancellation email that all of your data was not only backed up but that you knew we would delete it. We don't have enough storage space to keep backups for people who are no longer paying for data storage - and if you'll see our terms of service at http://our-company-site.com/terms we also state that our backups are a courtesy service. That service is limited only to paying customers. You have not been a paying customer for almost 9 months now. We do not have any data to restore for you, and those backups are long gone.

**Customer:** YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! I AM BEING SUED AND THESE EMAILS ARE BEING SUBPOENA'D AS EVIDENCE! YOU ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THEM!

**Me:** Actually, we aren't legally required to store anything for people who are not  paying for service, and you are the one who is being subpoenad for files you didn't back up. There is nothing we can do to help you. You agreed that you had a copy of your files and you agreed that you understood your entire account was being deleted when you canceled, that means backups too. We can't help you.

**Customer:** YOU GUYS ARE IMBECILES! What a f-cking joke! You are a storage service and I know you have backups! Just send it to me! 

**Me:** I'm sorry sir but [I simply have to disagree with that.](http://i.imgur.com/mFEpWWK.gif) We only store data for people who pay for that service. We have backups for paying customers ONLY. Which you are not. Furthermore, even if you WERE a paying customer, our backups would only be daily, weekly and monthly, so even if you paid the bill today, files that were deleted 9 months ago would be gone. You haven't been paying for the storage space, so we haven't been storing anything.

**Customer:** This is the WORST customer service I have ever seen!!!!! I can't believe the nerve.... how dare you delete those files, they were my files! 

**Me:** If those files were important to you, you should have used our Backup tool to download a copy of those files to your own hard drive, or your own data storage account with another service. You're right. They were your files. So why don't you have them? They're not our files to keep if you're not paying for the space to store them.

**Customer:** Ok... I'm sorry... please... just please restore the backup... I know you have it. If I paid for my account again would you be able to restore it? I am desperate, these files could save me thousands of dollars in this lawsuit.... please....

**Me:** Even if you did pay for your account again, it would be an empty account. The only way that there would be data in it is if you had downloaded your own backup and used our tool to restore that backup to the server. We have nothing to restore for you, regardless of if you are a paying customer right now or not. That data has been gone since February. 

**Customer:** Wow... just wow. I can't believe you won't restore my files. I guess it's time to post this email history on forums everywhere so people can know what a horrible company you are... you guys are demons.................... f-ck you dude...! F-CK YOU!

**Me:** Yes, please go post on the forums so people understand how important it is to download a free backup through their account with us, we would be delighted to see other people learn from your misfortunes and use this free backup tool to make copies of their important files. Have a great day, and good luck with your lawsuit.

A little background info, I work for a company that mainly hosts minecraft servers. Guess who wants to own their own minecraft server? 9 year old kids. Every time something goes down, or their server crashes due to user error, they seem to blame it on a DDOS attack. Why? No clue.


At about 3 am one morning, I received a ticket from a particular client who we've had a numerous amount of problems with. The conversation went a little something like this..



**Him**: My server crashed no plugins work someone is ddosing my server change my ip plzzzz.



**Me**: Hello ServerOwner! I'll be glad to take a look at that for you. None of our nodes are currently under a DDOS attack. It appears your server is crashing upon startup, due to you trying to run 32 plugins on our smallest memory plan. (For those who are not familiar with bukkit, bukkit is a mod for minecraft that allows plugins to run. Bukkit uses about 1GB of ram without any plugins, and uses anywhere from 100-200 more MB for each plugin installed. Not to mention the 100MB of memory that each player takes up when joining the server. He had a package that **only** had 512 MB of ram.) I highly suggest you upgrade to a higher memory plan if you wish to keep running these many plugins.



**Him**: fuck shit damn ass bitches (he used just about every cuss word he knew of) this worked yesterday I swear fix it plz or i will cancel i know someone trying to hack me



I pulled up the server log, turns out that the server has been crashing from a java out of memory error since about 3 hours after he bought the server with us. Meaning that it worked until he installed 30 plugins and tried to start it up. ***Facedesk***



**Me**: (getting annoyed) It is not a ddos attack, the error I am getting is a java out of memory error. What that means is your server does not have enough memory (ram) to start up. Your server is trying to use well over 1.5GB of ram, and your plan only allows 512mb.



**Him**: why are you lying? This is not my fault fix it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



**Me**: Mr.ServerOwner, I will be forced to suspend your account if you do not remove excessive plugins as you are causing unnecessary strain on the node, causing other clients services to lag. 



**Him**: fuck you you dont know what your talking about i know more than you i should have your job.

If anyone here has ever done tech support for an ISP, I'm sure you either have heard a co-worked deal with this, or have dealt with it yourself.  Someone using a residential line for 'business purposes' and they expect business level support and speed/etc.  


Is there even such a *thing* as business dial-up?  Yes, there was.  It was $5 more a month, but allowed you multiple connections at once with one account.  When I was at that dial-up company, we had about 150 customers on 'business dial-up'.  Most of them were legit businesses out in the boonies because DSL/Cable didn't exist in their areas, and paying $100+ a month (at the time) for Satellite Internet was out of the question.  Some of the 'business' customers were nerds that shotgunned the connections.  One of them maxed out at a full 5 connections at once (more than 5, and our Radius Server would boot out the extra connections) and that was what he ran for a long time until Verizon started offering 256k DSL in his area.  


Anyway, we had this one 'customer' who was of the very angry sort.  They were short tempered, ill-mannered, and spent the whole phone call complaining about how every minute they were offline was costing them 10's of thousands of dollars because they were too cheap to pay for ""business dial-up"" and multiple phone lines from their phone company.  That's right, that 20 minutes of ranting you just did while refusing to type in 3 letters/symbols into the INIT string for your modem was $200k worth of your profit out the door - you'd only be 10k in the hole if you just shut up and listened.


We ended up one day getting a subpeona from the state police for this person's e-mail/browsing history from our servers.  We were curious as this NEVER happened.  However, because we kept 6 month records of all customers, that is what we gave them.  


A couple weeks after that letter, the last call we got from ""Angry businessperson who is losing mega-money on you"" was them being very angry.  Apparently their phone line had been cut and this person was calling on a cell phone.  They wanted help setting up dial-up through a cell phone.  I admit to being rude and starting to laugh.  The person got madder and madder.  


This is the conversation at this point, between ME and AB (angry businessperson):
*****
Me: ""So, after complaining for months that we were costing you 10's of thousands a minute while you were offline, you couldn't even see fit to pay your phone bill?""

AB: ""Shut the *bleep* up!  The Feds are after me and cut my phone line!  I'm on the run in my car right now!""

Me:  ""Sir, that is hard to believe. Why would they be after you?""

AB:  ""Because someone ratted out my e-mails to them!""

Me:  *confused* ""I dont' get it sir, what kind of business e-mails would get you in that kind of trouble?""

AB:  ""This is a bum deal!"" **i hear police sirens in the background now** ""I PAY MY TAXES FOR MY BUSINESS!  METH AND COKE ARE NOT ILLEGAL!""

Me: *very confused*

captainmeta4,15,14,1o6z4l,89,"Quick background: my company does chemical water treatment for various types of industrial systems. I do a lot of field chemistry: monthly service calls to ensure that systems are operating within acceptable chemical parameters, etc. It's chemical tech rather than information tech, but there are still ample opportunities for the user stupidity that is so popular here. 

General idea: the controller is a fairly straightforward unit. When a system is low on water, it makes up water from a supply (often city water). When conductivity (quick and easy measure of total dissolved stuff) of the water is too high, the system bleeds off water to get rid of dissolved stuff. The controller also manages the chemical feed - the feed pumps are plugged directly into sockets on the controller (this is important)

Story: I went to a service call and found that at some point in the last month (probably in the last week) the injection valve for one of the feed lines had broken. Normally, this wouldn't be too serious of a problem. Except for one thing: at this location, some genius had taken it upon himself to remove the injection valve, plugged the injection port with a dummy cap (everything fine so far), and then, to prevent the pump from pumping chemical onto the floor, *unplugged the controller*. (Remember, pump could have simply been disconnected.)  As a result, the system couldn't bleed off water, and the conductivity had skyrocketed, putting the system at imminent risk of scale formation.

Almost a decade ago, when I worked at a large outsource call center doing tech support for a major desktop computer brand we used to get porn-related malware calls pretty regularly.  My cube-mate was on a call once and waved me over to listen, as it was his first house-wife calling about this type of issue.  They were usually pretty funny so I removed myself from the queue and jacked in to listen.

She had called in a panic because some adult site she had visited replaced her ""screen saver"" (wallpaper; my biggest tech pet peeve btw) with pornographic images and her husband was going to be home from work any minute.  She had to get it off there and sounded scared to death.

Sure enough her husband arrived before my cube-mate could calm her down enough to start troubleshooting.  We heard him yell ""what the f...?""  She shrieked and must have dropped the phone because we heard a loud thud, followed by the muffled sounds of physical violence, a male yelling, and a female screaming/crying.  It was hard to make out any details, as if the phone had landed face down on the carpet or something.  

I had been there maybe nine or ten months at this point, but I'd never heard anything like this before.  All either of us knew is that we should definitely call someone about it.

This particular help line didn't have a toll-free number, so customers were constantly asking us if we could call them back rather than paying long distance to troubleshoot a faulty product (and they usually were faulty!)  Because of this, all outgoing calls had to have team manager authorization before we could get an outside line so we flagged our team manager over and explained the situation.

His response?  ""It's none of your business.  If one of them aren't back to the phone in 5 minutes, thank them for calling and hang up.""  It was our standard response when the line went dead (usually while troubleshooting a modem) or if the customer put us on hold and didn't come back.  Neither of us could believe it.  We didn't have access to many external websites and this was long before smart phones were available or at least as ubiquitous as they are now... we had no idea what to do.  

I didn't want to hear any of what was happening so I quietly disconnected myself from his phone line and pushed off, rolling my chair back to my side of our cubicle.  I was heading home in a few minutes anyway, so I started packing up and left while he was still on the call.

Taelzos,9,14,1o61q6,96,"Okay so I wouldn't say I'm a tech support exactly. I work in Application Services for my company in the IT department - so basically my job is to keep my assigned software environments running, contact software vendors about issues, test new vendor software before bringing it into the company, and gathering requirements to existing software to give to developers. That sort of thing.

Anyways, I was submitting a ticket to our network admins for them to perform a change to an network alias, because I set up a new web environment for one of my applications because the last one was buggy. This was a production system, so there are restrictions around doing changes so it had to be at specific times and dates. The ticket was to delete the old alias and create a new url alias pointing to the new server, and bam the environments are changed over. 

After I submitted my ticket, I was ploddering around on my computer when I receive an email .. ""Such and such ticket has been completed"".

Oh, Shiiiiit.

Whoever had received the ticket completely ignored the date/time specified on it and just slammed it right there and then. Instantly my applications web interface is no longer accessible - and this is a maximum impact, 24/7 application that-must-not-ever-fail.

Three phone calls, a lot of angry words, and an hour later I finally get the changes undone and everything set up to go for the time I said in the ticket.

Needless to say, I had no choice but to send the issue to my supervisor and the supervisor of the network admin - this was not a small problem.

I joined Reddit for the sole purpose of posting this story, after prompting (for over a year) from asharkey3.

I have been in support roles for quite a while now (4+ years), and I have seen some doozies. Wen I was providing support for library software, I got a user who was trying to install [the program]. This was on a multi-disc platform. This part is important.

User: I'm trying to install [the program, latest version], and I'm running into issues...

Me: ~Yes... that's why you called...~ What sort of issues?

User: I installed disc one just fine, disc two gave me problems, but disc three would not install at all. What gives?

Me: Okay... that sounds pretty odd.

I then proceed to troubleshoot for over an hour with this person, trying to work out what's going on. I had her restart the computer, I had her check that the disc drive reads properly (tested with a handy music CD), did everything I possibly could.

Finally, exhausted, I was about to send her over to my T3, when I caught a flash of insight. She had seemed pretty PC illiterate, but surely...

Me: Did... did you take discs one and two out before trying disc 3?

User: ... oh.

I was speechless. HOW IN THE HELL DID DISC TWO EVEN READ???

Me: ... perhaps you should try reinstalling... but make sure you take out disc one before you put in disc two... and take out disc two before trying disc 3...

User: I will! Thanks!

I sat in stunned silence for about ten minutes afterwards. I had no idea that wouldn't be an assumption.

My boss is incredibly cheap. As cheap as cheap can be. We host our own websites (which are slow and frequently crash) because he won't pay for decent hosting. He complains every single time we have to pay for domain renewal because it's ""just a scam.""

So when our SMTP stopped working and I didn't know how to fix it, (the previous ""computer guy"" was hobbyist at best, and so am I for that matter) we started looking for an email service to use.

I began looking around to get him quotes on hosted email, but they were all just wayyy too expensive for him. A few weeks ago, when I was hunting down solutions for him, he suggested to me that we try AOL because his sister uses it. ""She had to call them once and they were on the phone with her for over an hour and a half helping her download the things she needed!"" That was a plus to him.

Anyways, skip ahead to where I've set us up with a free service using our own domains so we don't look like asses with email@aol.com. He sends out so much stuff that the service asks him to verify he's not a spammer via captcha nearly once a day. Here's how he goes about it:

1. Log into email account.

2. Complain that it does this to everyone (just him) every day.

3. Look for a way to get out of having to do it.

4. There's a link below the captcha for verifying your account that involves adding a mobile number. It opens a new tab.

5. Complain that they just want to harvest your phone number.

6. Want to close the tab. Click ""sign out"" to close the tab.

7. Realize that ""sign out"" didn't close the tab. Close the tab.

8. Back on captcha page. Enter captcha.

9. Redirected to sign in.

10. Complain that it started you over for no reason.

We have the ability to look at semester long schedules, and from I could see on the M-W schedules, a government faculty has that class reserved from 5:00p-6:30p on those days. It is possible that their class extended beyond that time by chance yesterday. Either way, please let the Registrar's know about this in order to avoid any future conflicts.

Smallwater,22,15,1o5rgl,99,"Let me start off with saying that I'm not a tech support guy. Hell, I don't even work. 
However, I do study IT in college, which makes me the go to guy when people in my dorm have issues with computers. Oh, the tales I get sometimes.  
Now, we have one (!) router for my entire dorm. That's 50 rooms, connected to one router. The rest of the network are just switches and hubs. Annoying sometimes, but somehow I get decent internet speeds.  
But right now, there is something weird afoot. People all over the building have come to me complaining that the internet ""goes wonky"" all the time. A simple router reboot works wonders, so I explained to some of them how the router works, and how they need to reset it. No biggie, some of the guys here are fairly computer literate, and picked up soon enough that when the internet goes out, they need to restart the router.  
But recently, I noticed that the internet goes out at an alarming rate. Like every 30 minutes. Weird. So, I get my ass over to the router cabinet, and try to figure out what's wrong.  
Nothing. Everything apears to be working just fine. So, I reboot the router again, and make my way back to my room.  
That's when I figured it out. As I say hello to a roommate coming through the hallway, he turns on the lights in the hallway. Poof. Everything dark. The lights, the kitchen appliances (router hangs next to the kitchen), everything.  
Bingo.  
Somehow, turning on the lights in the hallway causes something to shortcircuit, and everything goes dark. Unfortunately, that also means the router, and the internet.  
So, lights on; router out.

Another story from my magical job at the now closed dial-up company.
*****

There are times where you just get calls that blow your mind.  I've already posted about some of the stranger ones, like the cow eating the phone line or the illiterate drunk who wanted internet for Porn and NASCAR.  This is another tale of mystery and action whereupon our intrepid hero once again is in shock on his way to victory.


This repeat caller was one that I got from my first day on the job almost to the last day on the job.  He called in at least once a week.  It was always the same story, the same steps to fix the issue, yet he never seemed to remember them.  It even got to the point where I knew his wife's name, his childrens' names and even his pet dog's name.  


This gentleman was a nice enough fellow.  A bit daft in the head from what he claimed to be a brain injury - probably why he couldn't remember things - but was polite, loved to laugh, and was in general someone that made the job well worthwhile.  His problem every week was cleaning out malware/spyware.  


It was simple enough to walk him through how to update Malwarebytes and run it, and since he had a 2nd phone line - and the queue was almost never busy - I didn't mind chatting with him for the half-hour to 45 minutes it took to download malware definition updates and get through the scan.  Being as how I could see what websites he visited from my end - working at an ISP gives you access to things like this - I knew it was a porn addiction, but didn't say anything, as he was an affable fellow and decent enough on the phone.


This went on for those 2 years.  Near the end of my time at the company, when I told him I was gonna be leaving in a couple of weeks, he was sad, but asked me to be patient with him as he wanted to walk through the steps to clean up his computer one more time and write them down so he could do it on his own.  No problem.  I spent nearly 1 1/2 hours on the phone with him doing this.  


Then the phonecall was over.  About 5 hours later, it was nearing the end of my shift, and I noticed on our Radius Server that he was dialing in over and over and over.  I called him up to see if he was having issues - standard procedure for us at the time: if they are dialing in over and over, call them to help them before they call us all frustrated.  


It wasn't him I got when I called.  I got his wife.  She had no idea the computer was even attempting to dial-on as it was downstairs in the basement and everyone but her was out of the house for the evening as her kids were at a friend's house and her husband out with friends at a local college basketball game.  Since that was the issue, I told her it was probably a dialer (for those that remember, illicit programs designed to dial into long distance numbers to rack up huge charges that are hard to dispute).  I advised her it would be a good thing to go turn off the computer and unhook it from the phone line until it was cleaned up of the malware.  


She went downstairs to check.  Cue her suddenly breathing in loudly followed by an earsplitting scream, loud banging and doors slamming and heavy footsteps, the sounds of a gun going off, glass shattering, and then heavy breathing.  


She got back on the phone as I was starting to call the police to go to her house, and the following is a paraphrasing of what happened after she explained the ruckus:
*****
Apparently, her husband had lied to her about going out with his friends.  He had snuck their neighbor's underage daughter into their basement and was having sex with her while watching a likely illegal type of Porn - apparently the source of the dialer I had her go to check on.  


I have no idea why she had to point out the type of porn, but she did.  She got mad, and in her rage, shot her TV with her pistol while running the neighbor girl out of the house.  She then 'calmly' told me to stop dialing the police - I was in the middle of dialing her local police dept. - and that she would call them and report him herself.

An old friend of ours is fairly technically savvy in some ways. He likes to learn and we love him for that.

However, about once a quarter we usually get an email demanding our skype name, or asking for an email address. Even though he just successfully contacted us on one. This isn't the annoying part though. 

The stupid has two parts
1) He never likes to acknowledge that he has, yet again, locked himself out of his account. So what's the best course of action? Pretend it was us that was uncontactable.

2)Once he does have the aforementioned details, he never emails or skypes us, or if he is feeling particularly vehement we get twenty missed calls at 2am. He understands that there are time zones, just not the practical application of them. Then we don't hear from him again until he wants an email address.

So, about two months back I get an email asking for my skype address. it goes well. We actually manage to communicate. Cool beans! He does give me the hated ""let's keep in touch"" line, but I swallow the bile and take it in the best way I can.

Today, I get another email, asking if this mail address works. This is slightly odd. I usually only get these once a quarter, but I suppose he's only a month early.

I usually walk him through adding a skype contact, or saving an email to his contacts. Or how IM works.

He decides to **emphasize** just how uncontactable we are, by putting his name, mobile, and two email addresses at the bottom of the email.
And then mention how we are both uncontactable. But does he actually give any news? 

NEVER! He'll talk to us when he establishes this email is mine, and not owned by the aliens... or Obama... or possibly checking that the internet itself hasn't stolen my address.

Jesus christ on a fucking poco stick! 

My OH's and my email addresses have been the same for three years. As have our skype names. My secondary address has been the same for the last five years. And just to put the icing on the cake, my husband puts his current phone number at the bottom of every email he sends. And he emailed this friend less than two months ago.

Arrrrgggghhhh. Just admit you lost your password, or hard drive, or saved passwords list or whatever and need our details again!

A customer has their vendor call us complaining of slow speed. We share the bandwidth results. The customer is still convinced that things aren't right.

He does a series of speed tests, and gets the proper 1.48 megabit. Then starts to do downloads while doing the speedtests. While he's downloading, his speedtests come up lower. Exactly as they should.

The salesperson manages to annoy both the vendor and the customer.. so they ask to have a conference call with me. I go through the long explanation of how bandwidth works.

Eventually I educate the man, and he seems satisfied with how networks work. I felt good. His vendor felt good.... Then came another call. Our customer felt that a router that only has a 100 meg port on it is slowing him down.

... He thinks he's been a good customer, and we should replace his high end T1 router, with one that has a gigabit port on it. For what reason, I can not fathom. Evidently his 1.54 megabit needs 1000megabit to get to him properly.

At least that second conference call was quick. Explaining that nobody makes a dedicated T1 router that supports gigabit covered most of his concerns.

I made a cardinal mistake though. I asked what she needed it for. She had a hard copy of a document that needed page numbers so she was going to use the word document pages as letterhead and recopy the document. It works but ...really?

""Thank you for the email to advise that Outlook is currently offline.  Whilst hilarious, these emails are also incredibly annoying.  A prime example of this is the **seven** that were sent last Friday.  Sadly, that is not even the high score.

atticusmas,11,21,1o39j1,37,"I'm a high schooler, and I am on the IT team for a small prep school. At the end of the day we start getting people saying the internet is broken. This is not actually all that common so when it goes down we go into emergency mode. 

Usually when the internet goes down it is for one of two reasons - either someone has decided to plug our ethernet back into itself due to extreme stupidity (this happened many times), or someone has plugged in their own router that starts assigning IP addresses to people on the network and confusion happens. This is usually the case because a lot of parents and sometimes teachers want internet but don't have the password so they bring their own router.

So in either case we have to look around the entire building, trying to find what the problem is. Router is pinging fine so we don't think that is the problem. We keep looking, asking all the staff if they plugged in a router -- nothing. 

We go into the server room and see a lovely seizure of lights blinking on and off and on and off. We try to log into the router....

But our password isn't working. We're sure it's the right password. I suggest we try a default login like admin admin, and it logs in. Turns out all settings on the router decided to clear themselves, for no reason. We figure that the router just crapped out on us so we go and get a new router.

We spend a couple hours around looking at stores and eventually getting dinner, and we buy some cheap Cisco small buisiness router, and set it up. Internet is pretty fast, but logins are taking literally ten minutes.

We don't know what to do at this point as it was around 9:00 then, so we left. In the morning our school tech admin looked at the settings again and we had accidentally set up our router to request logins towards our ISP which then went back to us, causing the long wait.

goodBEan,27,26,1o2qkn,66,"A little backstory, a few months ago my sister bought a laptop for my 13 year old nephew (thinking either birthday present or Christmas). She asked me to setup a few things and make sure everything is good. One of the things I did was setup my nephew as a standard user account and added a backup admin account as a precaution. I shared the password with my brother-in-law and it was all good.

A few nights ago I was over at the house for a family get together. I was asked to do a quick check on the laptop because it ""was running slow"". Figured alright since I was bored as hell. So I updated a few pieces of software and checked a few things. At one point I went to check to see the hard drive to see if it was fragmented. Windows asked me for the admin password and I couldn't exactly remember it. So the next conversation is when it all went down hill. I was sitting on the kitchen table, my brother in law was on the couch with everyone else.

(I changed the names)

&gt; ME: ""Hey Rob, do you still have that email or paper with the admin password on it?"" 
&gt; 
&gt; Rob:""Oh yeah, the password is ********""  (keep in mind it was right in front of little billy and everyone heard it).
&gt; 
&gt; Billy: ""really thats what that was.""
&gt; 
&gt; ME: (facepalm) ""are you kidding me?""
&gt; 
&gt; Rob: ""what, its no big deal?""
&gt; 
&gt; My-mother: ""Its not like its (the admin password for every computer in the family buisness that I was forced to give up once)""
&gt; 
&gt; my-sister: ""What you think somebody is going to hack in and steal his science paper on lama spit?""
&gt; 
&gt; ME (with even more of a wtf expression on my face): ""you don't have a clue""


So my family is kinda clueless about this sort of thing and thinks that ""there is no reason for anyone to go after us"". I could explain why its stupid to be that careless but they wouldn't listen.

Anyway I was chilling at home when I got a call from the client, turns out that they had downloaded a QR scanner and as some of you may know an iPod touch 5g 16GB doesn't have a rear facing camera so when they downloaded and installed the app his iPod touch screen stopped responding essentially bricking it 

After many hours of getting the device to enter DFU mode I finally managed to unbrick it and restore it to factory settings. Then when I tried to resync it the user had forgotten their password so that was another half hour of recovering that. Finally after 5 hours of getting the device restored and threatening to send it off to apple to fix next time the user gave me $50 and said thanks.

Extra Info:
Code scanner line ran back and forwards across screen
Input was disabled other than power and home buttons

We've been getting ""prepare for domain migration"" emails for several months now, but due to our office's move back in June it was deferred til around this time.

Last month we had a rash of people (the ones still using XP) getting emails that they needed to go to a company website, fill out information about their workstation, including some applications they use, and submit it. I knew things would be coming to a head for the W7 people to start getting notifications that the domain scripts would start doing their work, so I sent an email out 2-3 weeks ago saying ""Very soon we will start getting notifications that certain programs will be needed on your computer. Please ensure the installation windows state (company/domain) and follow all instructions.""

Yesterday they apparently started to roll these scripts out to my office based on employee ID.

I get an IM from a woman in my department (Departmental Coworker) and tell her yes, this is legit, and that she must close all apps then just let the script restart her computer.

Not 5 minutes later I get a personal desk visit from one of my problem children asking the same thing.
Seeing as how it's barely 9am and most of the office hasn't arrived yet, I proactively send an email.

&gt;Good morning,

&gt;Possibly today, but very likely this week everyone in the office using Windows 7 will start receiving popups with (Company/Domain) text and graphics stating that a download is occurring.

&gt;After you click OK on that message, you will eventually get a popup (with Company/Domain) text and graphics stating that you must close all open programs on your computer, then to click OK on the script/install notification window. DO NOT use your computer during this time.

&gt;The installation process may take 10+ minutes, but it will eventually restart your computer.

Around 11am I get an email from a woman in the other Support department (who primarily works from home.)

**Her**: How long am I supposed to wait for the computer to restart?

**Me**: It'll probably take a few minutes, but make sure you don't do anything with your computer, just let it do its thing

**Her**: How will I know when it's done?

**Me**: Your computer will automatically restart.

**Her**: How long is it supposed to take?

**Me**: I don't know, but only a few minutes.

**Her**: And I can't work during this?

**Me**: No

At 3:55pm I get an IM from Departmental Coworker (**DC**).

**DC**: You have GOT to call me when you get off that support call

**Me**: (I call her)

**DC**: Yo, have you talked to (Other Support Department Lady) recently?

**Me**: She emailed me around 11am asking about my domain migration email

**DC**: Oh, she got it alright (she can barely keep herself from laughing)

**DC**: She called the customer-facing Support 800 number.

**DC**: Apparently (laughing) when she received your email, she closed all her programs

**Me**: Okay

**DC**: No, no. (laughing) She never got the warning about the domain migration. (Laughing) She closed all her programs. (laughing) and shut down her computer.

**Me**: (by now I'm laughing too)

**DC**: (laughing) AND! AND! she said she was waiting for you to call her back to tell her she could turn her computer back on

**Me**: (Laughing) Wait, what?

**DC**: YES! Holy crap! She's been waiting FOUR AND A HALF HOURS for you to call her to tell her that her domain prep was finished and to turn her computer back on

**Me**: (semi-sobering) So she never got the warning, but instead used my email as if they were instructions to shut her computer down and, instead of calling back within 30 minutes, waited ALL DAY to find out if something that needed to be done on her computer, which cannot be done because its shut down, was in fact actually taking place?

**A Little Background:** I'm currently working as a paid intern in a secondary school/sixth form (college) here in the UK, helping out two other IT Technicians.


**The Tale:** So the school recently decided to give brand new Windows Surfaces to every Sixth Former. They didn't bother consulting us about this however so were completely unprepared when more than 30 of the things turned up in our office.

Now I know next to nothing about the Surfaces but even I can predict what's going to happen. You can't connect Windows RT to a domain so we can't manage them with things like group policies and Active Directory logins so we know all hell is about to break loose when the Staff starts handing these tablets out to everyone before we've even had a chance to turn one on.

So this morning more than a dozen students come into our office asking to be connected to the Wi-Fi. Our usual method of simply using their logins doesn't work so my co-worker opens up AD and works his magic. I'm not too knowledgeable with AD besides setting up new students and resetting passwords but he manages to set up a group and gets some of them connected.

Their logins should work now so that's what we tell them, some manage to connect, some not. The ones that couldn't presented a number of face-palming moments.

&gt; **Student A: ""Do I need to use my school login?""**
    
&gt;*What else are you going to use!*
    
&gt; **Student B: ""I don't have a login.""**
    
&gt;*You've been here nearly 2 months, Why haven't you come to see us!*
    
We've still got the odd student coming in for help connecting but the problems aren't just limited to student's.
    
&gt; **Teacher: ""I've got some students that need to print from their Surfaces, can you set them up?""**

M: Certainly, can I get your IP address?

U: It's 10.X.X.X (These users have to give the IP to us all the time so they are pretty good about getting that)

I connect on and take a look at the error, its a generic run time error that comes up when word tries to open the document, it doesn't actually tell me what the issue is (of course)  but I typically see this when someone has tried to change the document from .doc to .docX by simply telling iManage its a .docX file. Long story short it confuses word and makes it not work until you change it back.

Now to verify this I forwarded a copy of the document to her email and then downloaded it, that way I could just rename it, and voila! it works again. Here comes the snag of course.

M: Okay, I see what the problem is, someone changed the document type the wrong way, I can fix this for you.

U: So its fixed? (I'd forgive the misunderstanding as she can see the document up, but I literally had just said I **CAN** fix it so yeah, derp user is derp)

M: No, I haven't actually done anything to the file yet.

U: Let me go ahead and try opening it.

M: But I haven't done anything to it yet, it is still broken.

U: I'll Open it now.

M: ....

U: It still isn't working, why haven't you fixed it?

*Maybe because I'm not some fucking technical wizard that can fix things by looking at them!*

In the end she doesn't even let me actually fix it, she just saves the local copy I made as a new file in the system... technically that works but it took more effort for her to do that then it would have for me to make the edit.... oh well.

effingWitchDoctor,34,38,1o15zs,267,"Greetings TFTS. Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. Sorry if it's unbearably long.

I went to school in a small, very liberal college you may have heard of. There I started my career in IT helping clueless students navigate every issue you can imagine. After, I attained a Master's at another school you may have heard of and proceeded to bounce from one odd tech job to the next until finding my place as a system administrator for a machine and simple robotics designer a year ago. I have worn a great many hats in my time, but this story takes place a few quarters before my first real job as tech support. It is the year 2005. Here, I am a young tech enthusiast with just enough foo to grab the attention of my less-handy peers. This is the story of Steve.

Steve was a friend of my sophomore-year roomie. Steve, like his father before him, was pursuing a career in accounting. He appeared to everyone a humorless, stern, and meticulous individual who would have been happier in the '60s; Steve's attire and tastes clearly belonged to a middle-aged man. He wore suspenders, tweed, derbies, and other semi-antiquated clothing that fit perfectly with his horn-rimmed glasses. He listened almost exclusively to jazz and classical music and couldn't fathom the interest his peers showed in anything that could be confused with modern music. He drove an ancient Volvo that he serviced and cleaned meticulously.

He was also an excellent student and dedicated family-man. When his father asked him to take a computer literacy course so someone in the family business would know how to use excel he hurled himself at the problem full force. 

Steve called on me (his words) one evening to see if I would be able to upgrade his computer to run excel. I was a bit puzzled by the request due to the miniscule system requirements of the program but agreed. He came by the next day with his computer to see if I could bring his machine up to spec.

I admit I was not prepared for what he set in front of me. It was an ugly tan mini- and/or micro-ATX (or something like it) desktop computer. I had seen one such computer from the mid to late '90s before, but assumed the powers that be had seen the horror unleashed on the world and eradicated it. On attempting to boot the machine I was greeted by a Windows 3.1 splash screen. On opening the machine I found parts of unusual sizes with names not recognized by the google apparatus. 

The conversation that followed went something like this:

EWD: You just plain need a new computer, Steve. I can help pick one out or put one together if you like.

Steve: I'd really prefer to keep this one. Let's just focus on upgrading it.

EWD: I don't think you can find parts for something like that. You would need to replace every single part anyways. It would be much cheaper and easier to just start anew.

Steve: I like this computer though. Can you just keep it in this one?

EWD: It won't even be the same computer then! And besides, it would cost a ton to find parts and it would take hours to put it together!

Steve: Money's not a problem. Will you do it then?

I finally agreed to try to upgrade the computer. After he left the box with me I gutted it and started taking interior measurements. I then pieced together a parts list using not the best-priced components, but the smallest. In a couple of weeks, I had my pieces.

I will spare the more painful details, but I assembled the machine inside the original box. I had to set new standoffs for the mobo. I had to cut the new I/O shield down to fit. I had to sketch, cut, fold, and tap sheet metal to make supports for the drives, power supply, and case fan (bit of custom work to the case itself, too). The wiring I did my damnedest on.

In all I think I spent nearly 20 hours just assembling the box. I installed XP on the machine, installed the guilty software suite, and called up Steve.

He was as excited as I ever saw him. He paid the hefty sum with a smile and marveled at the speed of the word processor and calculator (the utilities he understood). I have never seen a happier user in my life. 

He eventually graduated and went to work with his family. I would be shocked if that strange little box isn't still humming away in his office.

tl;dr: there exists an organization operating below and without the means of normal users. These 'Illiterati' affect the world in ways unknown even amongst themselves.","My computer doesn't meet the system requirements, can you upgrade it for me?",305
angelothewizard,8,17,1o0cl0,27,"Since you guys liked my ""Good Guy Printer"" story from a while back, I'd thought I'd share an irate-yet-stupid customer story.

So, as you may know by my flair, I am a Computer Lab Assistant. My job is primarily to help students at my college understand how computer work. Considering what I've seen of my fellow Lab Assistants, I may be the Only Competent Employee. 

But back to my actual story. Yesterday, a student came up to me and leaned towards me after pressing her knees up to my desk. I was currently grinding a few levels in Pokemon: Fugelin (don't knock it, it's a modded game that's got a hell of a difficulty spike), so I was a little weirded out by her...invasive tactics. ""Can I help you?"" I asked.

""Do you know why my stuff didn't print?"" Now, tone is difficult to convey through the internet, so I will tell you what her tone was: ""IT'S YOUR FAULT."" I started by asking if she had confirmed the job (our school computers pop up with an extra box telling you the price of the job and asking if you want to go through with it). This is a common mistake, it's my variant of turning it off and on again.

She said she had never seen a confirmation box, while still keeping the ""it's your fault"" tone. So I decide to head over to where she was working at and see if I could figure out the problem. I ask her where she's working at, and she directs me to the computer in the back corner.

Here's where it gets stupid: The way the lab I work in is set up, there are four rows of computers, all neatly separated off from each other. There is, however, one more computer in the back corner. Now, most of the computers on campus are set up to do printing, and the few that aren't are usually in buildings that don't have a printer. As it turns out, the computer she was working on was the ONLY COMPUTER IN THE ENTIRE LIBRARY that was not connected to the printers.

So, I told her she'd have to switch computers to print, at which point she responded with a flat ""Oh"". I returned to my desk to continue the grind, with a new story for the TFTS guys.

I'm thinking how strange it is for him to be marrying off his 1 year old to me.  Minutes later, the actual daughter, and progenitor of the baby (and pregnant for a second time), marches across the trailer after a shower, in only a towel.  Okay.  I understand now.  Minutes after that, said daughter marches back across the trailer from her room, very slowly, and very pregnant-ly, with only a wet white T-Shirt on and no undergarments to speak of.  Father acts as if nothing happened and mother continues to chain smoke in front of grand-daughter.  I stopped making eye contact with anyone in that home and hastened my retreat from Defcon 2 to Defcon 1.  PS - She wasn't bad looking!

**The Self-Installer:**

In store diagnosis.  Man walks up and immediately starts using the biggest computer words he can to establish his dominance as Alpha Computer Owner Who Knows All.  He produces a stick of RAM not matching the aftermarket brand of the memory box.  It's OEM RAM.  Box says Kingston.  I explain that this isn't the RAM I'm looking for.  He agrees.  He says, ""I upgraded the RAM myself.  I bought two modules and I'm returning this.""  I conclude that the RAM came from the laptop itself.  I tell him that he can keep the RAM from the laptop and he needs to give me the RAM module that he didn't need.  The laptop was a Gateway with 1 expansion port.  He tells me that he installed both.  Curious, I open the laptop and see the expanded RAM chip, but I also see a mess of cracked plastic, circuit board pieces, and mounds of solder.  He had removed the soldered-in DIMM through use of copious kinetic force, and then replaced the module with a solid line of solder across the contacts.  I explained that he had ruined the computer and that he could have just bought a 2gb stick instead of 2x1gb.  He called me a liar stating that the computer worked fine before he brought it in here and me revealing the problem has ruined his 3 day old laptop.  He demanded a comparable model and thus the battle between management and the customer ensued.  He actually was given a new laptop.  Made me sick!

**The Conspiracy Theorist:**

In store diagnosis.  Man brought in computer, telling me that his mo-dam (layman terms for ""the Internet"") didn't work anymore because someone ""hacked"" him.  I was also told to fix it on the spot so he could watch me.  Furthermore, I was told that I could not, under any circumstances, take the machine online (uhhh... I kind of have to to prove that the fix worked).  Explained that both of these concessions weren't possible due to time required to fix the computer and necessity to test the fix.  Rage ensues and the managers talk him down to an in store repair instead of depot repair.  Several days later, the repair is complete (it's a bad NIC.  PCI NIC installed to bypass mobo NIC).  He comes in and inspects his computer.  He asks who provides our electricity and for how long I had the computer connected to power.  The answer is ""I don't know... Duke Energy?"" and ""It's been plugged in since we started fixing it.""  More rage ensues because the government can use power lines to communicate to computers and they've been working with Microsoft to build that into Windows XP.  O-kay.  More rage ensues as he sees ""a dent"" in his case.  Manager offers to replace case for free.  Man rages more, demanding to know why his computer wasn't locked in a cage when not in use.  Asks if anyone shady has been in the back room.  Once calm enough for me to explain the fix, he goes ballistic and slams his fist on the counter, exclaiming that I am unqualified and that I am part of the problem with America.  He *KNOWS* that the problem was the CIA hacking into his computer because they *KNOW* about the things he's been downloading.  His face turns beet red and he accuses me of copying his files to a removable source.  I cannot speak at this point, as I'm scared.  He takes this as an admission of guilt and threatens me with breaching international law and that I would rot in a foreign prison if I tried to run.  The man was escorted from the premises by loss prevention with his fixed computer.  The bill was zeroed out.

I have plenty more and many are NSFW, but I hope my donation to the archives of tech support are worthy.  I also know that similar things have happened before, though the rarity of them make them worth mentioning.

Thanks and keep fighting the good fight.

scrottiemac,24,12,1o07i0,85,"Hi guys, long time lurker, first time poster. I have truly loved this forum since my finding of it and now I think I have something somewhat worthy of a post. I am a network admin major at a local community college. It's my second time through school and in my first, I became somewhat familiar with computers in general, notably the udacity.com tutorials. I made the search engine and the web browser and have gone on to other various projects. As I embark on my continued education, I applied for a job with the helpdesk as a work study. Basic stuff like reseating ram, downloading os's, general trouble shooting. Nothing I can't handle. 

Anyway, I get the email to come in for the interview. 
The head of the CPT department. The big man. The guy that has the ultimate decision in everything this school does computer-related is interviewing me. At first I felt intimidation. This is my first time ever being interviewed by someone of this status. He looks at my resume and asks in his most sincere oblivious tone, ""What exactly is python?"" I looked confused and made sure to understand the question ""The programming language?"" I inquired. ""Oh, ok. Why?"" Now I'm completely confused. He was wondering why I had put forth the effort to make those things. ""Why not?"" was the only response I could generate. I truly thought people did this for fun. 

Anyway, I know it isn't much but I found it to be quite funny. I told some guys in my classes and they got a chuckle as well. 

I guess the moral of the story is that if you don't stay on top of it, it'll leave you behind.

tl;dr, If it was a snake, it would've bit him.",What is....Python exactly?,97
keenedge422,47,71,1o067i,500,"So I work for a university that offers Windows and MS Office for free to students. Occasionally we have calls from incoming students who try to download the software before they've enrolled in classes and the system rejects their attempt because their status shows as ""accepted"" rather than ""student."" This may have been the most shocking call I've ever received about the issue:

""I'm trying to download Windows 8 but the system won't let me!""  

**""Not a problem, let me look up your account... ok, it appears that you haven't registered for classes, yet, so you'll need to do that first before you can download the software.""**  

""Oh my god, this is such bullshit! I'm not registering until tomorrow! You mean I have to wait a whole DAY to download this software?! I want to download it now!""

It... it happened. A user actually heard themselves sound like a horrible person AND CORRECTED IT.

yabossobay,40,31,1o04f2,244,"Greeting TFTS, as my first post I present to you some tales from my time so far as an IT in the USN over the past year or so. I love my job and being in the navy as an IT provides for some interesting work environments and, as you might guess some interesting users. These all take place onboard a warship floating around in the middle of nowhere.

**""The tale of the 'broken computer' and my awesome boss.""**

There is a particular group of users with the job title of OS (Operations Specialist) who just love to call the IT's whenever the most simple of problems arises. The following is my favorite dealing with them:

&gt;OS: ""Hey you need to get up here one of our computers is broken, I cant do my job!""

&gt;Me: ""Well whats the symptoms, what do you see? Any errors?""

&gt;OS: ""No that's the problem! I cant see anything on the screen!""

&gt;Me: *sigh, here we go again.* ""Alright Ill be up there as soon as I can.""


So I get up there and the user shows me to the ""broken computer"". He turns around and goes off to speak to one of his OS buddies and leaves me to look into it. The computer tower itself looks to be working, or at least powered, So its time to start checking cables. I notice that the monitor LED power light is off. (standard monitor, orange light being asleep, blue meaning connected and powered on.)

*There is no way they just don't have the power connected to the monitor.*

I check around to where the monitor is plugged and find the surge protector. Yep! The slot where I presume it would normally be plugged into is instead occupied by one Iphone changer, with the monitors power cord hanging next to it.

I 'fix' his computer and go back to my shop to tell my boss what just happened. After the story was told he said ""follow me I need to see this"". And together we both walk back up to the space the OS's work at. We get up there and then this happened.

&gt;Boss: To me, ""This the computer?""

&gt;Me: ""Yep.""

&gt;Boss Proceeds to re-unplug it again and turns to me.

&gt;Boss: ""When they call back down, just come get me and ill handle it.

&gt;Me: ""Um... Aye aye.""

We go back to our shop and not minutes later they call again telling me its still broken. I pass the phone off to my boss, as instructed and he says:

&gt;Boss: ""This is IT1 how can I help you sir or ma'am.""

&gt;OS: ""Yeah I just had your IT3 come look at our computer and its still broken.""

&gt;Boss: ""Yep I know. He fixed it, it was really an easy fix. But I un-fixed It.""

&gt;OS: ""What? why would you do that?""

&gt;Boss: *Very sternly* ""Because your division wastes our time more than any other on the ship, and we have actual important trouble shooting to do as well as comms to set up and we cant be dealing with your department all day. Now im going to teach you how to trouble shoot. Ready?""

&gt;OS: "".... yes?""

&gt;Boss: ""Alright, pretend its your microwave in you house and it doesn't have any lights/or time displaying on it, what the fuck would you check first?""

&gt;OS: ""Uhhh see if its plugged in?""

&gt;Boss: ""There you go buddy. Don't call us again without checking for stupid shit.""

Made my entire day, of course they still called about super easy things from time to time, But significantly less now.

**""OH GOD WORD IS EATING MY LETTERS""**

Some of you have already guessed whats going on in this one. I cant even be mad at this because as kids we were all very confused on what was going on when it happened to us writing essays in middle school.

Yessir I speak of ""Overtype"". The thing that happens when you bump the insert key on accident and everything you were trying to type into the middle of that sentence is now typing over it instead. 

I even knew what the problem was and so I trekked all the way forward from my IT shack and busted into their room. Walked over to the affected computer and slammed that insert key with the force that only thousands of dollars of the Navy's money and 11 months of school could provide.

All in all it was a good day.

**""The tale of the great Outlook Calamity.""**

This one has got to be my favorite story to tell about the thought process of users. The user was very polite, just not at all technically inclined, and I don't personally mind that as long as they make an effort to learn which most do.

Enter monday, just got underway and we have some new shipmates onboard. Mostly ship-riders (temporary assigned to the ship for the duration of the deployment) and so I get tasked with setting up their AD accounts and emails and such. All completed without a problem, easy day easy money.

A few hours later Grand Central Station (the name we gave our main helpdesk phone) rings, ensuring us our day would not be without some fun trouble calls. Being the closest I answer.

&gt;Me: ""IT3 speaking how may I help you sir or ma'am.""

&gt;SR(ship-rider): ""Yes good morning IT3, this is LT so and so I managed to log into my computer just fine, but I seem to be having problems sending emails.""

&gt;Me: ""Okay sir, can you give me some symptoms on what outlook is doing for you?""

&gt;SR: ""I write my mail and then it just sits in the outbox and doesn't go anywhere. Everyone says they aren't getting my emails back on shore.""

&gt;Me: ""Oh, okay sir, give me a few minutes i'm on my way.""

Of course to me this sounds like outlook just lost connection to the exchange server, simple reconnect should do it. I check our server just in-case and make sure its a localized problem and not network wide, then head to the LT's space. I even send a test email to see if he gets it when I get there.

&gt;Me: ""Hello sir, let me have a look and see what the issue is.""

I see about 30 messages in his outbox like he said, but he is still connected to the server, AND my test email is sitting in his inbox. Strange. So I have him show me what he is doing to send his emails, thinking it might be a plugin issue, we have one that stalls outgoing mail sometimes.

He shows me that he opens up an new message by clicking new message, writes a few lines. Good so far.

He then hits save... interesting but whatever maybe he likes to be safe.

CLOSES OUT OF HIS MESSAGE. Goes to his DRAFTS.... and proceeds to CLICK AND DRAG the message into his Outbox folder.

&gt;wut.

&gt;Me: ""... oh sir, there's the issue.""

&gt;SR: ""What, whats the matter?""

&gt;Me: ""Sir you have to actually hit send before closing out of your message, you cant just drag it into your outbox.""

&gt;SR: ""Really?""

&gt;Me: ""....really.""

&gt;SR: ""Oh thank you Ill try that.""

&gt;Me: ""No problem sir.""

And of course like any good IT I go back to my shop and tell them all the great thing that I just witnessed.

Thanks for reading!

ladyithis,19,10,1nzrkj,54,"Back in the early 00's, I was a in-house tech support for a college at my university. The university had their own IT department, but my role was just for the college and wasn't clearly defined. I did anything from helping staff figure out why their cursor all of a sudden changed to a Comet Cursor (because you downloaded it) to keeping the college's website up-to-date. (Lots of mundane things that hopefully kept calls to the IT department down). 

On this particular day, I was helping one of the department's office managers upload some changes to the website. She had just made changes to the HTML pages, but didn't have a an FTP program to upload them. No worries, there's lots of free FTP programs we can use. So while I was standing at her desk, I directed her to a popular download site. Suddenly, the page that appeared was not one that I was expecting, and after quickly scanning the page, I told her to close it! 

Office Manager: ""Why?!""

Me: ""Because you typed in the URL incorrectly and now you're on an adult website."" 

Office Manager: ""Does the spelling even matter?!"" 

Me: ""Yes!"" *sighs*

Eventually, I was able to get her to the correct website, download a free FTP program, and get their website changes uploaded. Then explained to her about how adult websites liked to buy domains that were close in spelling to popular website domains. 

TL;DR: User thought that any spelling of any website domain should take her to the website she wants to go. ",Does the Spelling Even Matter?!,64
S3erverMonkey,20,22,1nzk38,151,"So here I am, manning the Helpdesk this morning. Not my job, as I am server side, but Helpdesk Manager was running late due to vehicular troubles, no students were scheduled to work and the other full time Helpdesk staff was let go for ""budgetary reasons"". When a student brings in a laptop.

Not her laptop mind you, no she was sent by roommate to drop this laptop off. Not her roommate's laptop though. It's the roommates instructor's laptop that needs work.

So here's this poor student who has no information for me other than the vague: ""Mic doesn't work? Or something?"". Also doesn't have contact information for this faculty member. 

So the laptop is going to sit until faculty person decides she can actually be bothered to come up here. 

tl;dr read the title. 

Update as I write this: Helpdesk Manager comes in, I tell him what's happened all morning blah blah blah. He's like nope user isn't getting any help unless she comes in. ","Faculty can't be bothered to bring laptop up, sends it with a student who also couldn't be bothered",173

TollhouseFrank,510,1171,1nzgin,2133,"Another story from my magical job at that now closed dial-up company.  
*****

I had been at the company now for a year and a half or so (was there slightly over 2 years) and had become good friends with some of our 'regulars' - aka repeat callers.  If you have ever worked at a small company and have regulars, you know how it goes.  You see their phone number on the caller id and you know who it is and what the problem is before picking up the receiver.  Some of the regulars were not so nice and were not friends - they were more like enemies to be treated politely so as to get them off the phone as fast as possible with as little stress as possible.


One of these repeat enemies - errrr... callers - claimed to be a professor at a local college in it's engineering department and all the time talked about the 'boost in spending' after it got paired with a much larger college near the northern panhandle (if you are from WV, you already know which college it is).  He was very snooty, and because he was so smart, had a ""Doctorate"", and taught a 'real discipline', not a 'fake industry like IT', that he was better than me and all the other techs.  You could hear the disdain in his voice everytime he called.  You could tell he thought we were beneath him, and should service his every whim.


Well, after dealing with him for months, and his disdain over everything - even calling me a liar when I explained to him how noise on the phoneline interfered with the signal - I finally got the ""shocker"" of a call from him.  As an explanation of the ""lie"" about noise on the lines - being an ""Engineer"", he was too smart to fall for the lies of interference and instead kept telling me how noise on the line wasn't possible because it was against Electrical Physics Properties or some such thing. 


Anyway, he calls in one day, and claims to have a bought a new computer and wants us to walk him through setting up the connection - aka ""the only useful damn thing you retards can do"".  That is an exact quote from that call.  After doing the usual steps, and being ready to get him off the phone, I tell him he will have to hang up to then dial-in and try the service.  


But WAIT my friends, he is an ENGINEER!  He thought ahead!  He was on his brand new Portable Mobility Enhancement Device!  Crying inwardly, I went into robot mode and waited as he tried to dial up.  1x.  2x.  3x.  by the 4th attempt, it was obvious he was getting no dial-tone.  I asked him to double check to make sure the phone cord was connected at the wall and at the computer.  He got mad and cussed at me, but then 'confirmed' it was.  I even had him unplug/replug both ends until he heard the 'click' just to make sure it was firmly seated.  


After he tried again, still no dial-tone, I concluded his pc had a bad modem from the factory (it happens, modems were throw-away devices and had terrible failure rates) and as I was starting to suggest this, he cut me off, and stated the following gem of wisdom:
*****
""I don't need a modem.  This new PC has a Universal Serial Bus port.  I just flattened the end of the phone line with a pair of pliers and jammed it into that port.  It is Universal, so that means it will fit and use anything!""
*****

I was stunned.  Beyond stunned.  He was a self proclaimed ""Engineer and Useful Member of Society"" and I was a ""Useless IT Retard"".  Yet to hear him admit to purposely mangling and misusing a phone jack and USB port (I have no idea how he fit it in there, even squished with a pair of pliers) just floored me.  


At this point, I just started laughing.  It was all I could do.  I laughed hard and long.  The more he got mad and yelled and cussed at me, the more I laughed.  After a few minutes, I calmed down enough to tell him to take his brand new computer to his IT Department on campus and have them explain to him why what he did wouldn't work.  


Later that month, he sent a 'strongly worded' letter to us asking us to disconnect him from the service because our dial-up did not work with Universal Sandwiches - Yes, a direct quote from his letter.
*****
TL;DR - USB will work with anything, even if it doesn't fit.

Only not in a douche way. She ordered some scrapbooking thing called a [Cricut](http://www.amazon.com/Cricut-Expression-Electric-Cutting-Machine/dp/B0018N7VDC/ref=zg_bs_262676011_4)? Anyway, it has a little' backlit resistive LCD display for controls and stuff she bought off a home shopping channel. She couldnt see the display properly, it was all blurry and not resonding very well and seemed pretty much broken.

She called the help line and they couldnt' figure anything out after at least an hour of troubleshooting with her over the phone and ended up sending her a replacement. She offered to send the original back but they just said to keep it.

This was the day my father earned my respect when it came to technical common sense. This tale does not feature me: it was all my dad. He whacked some sense into a particularly illiterate coworker.

My dad is a retired Coast Guard commander, and he has since used his nautical skills to engineer a piloting company. Let's call it CHEAPA, because the actual acronym is very close to that, and they are frugal as hell.


CHEAPA organizes a company-wide teleconference about twice a year. As CHEAPA is very spread-out and disorganized most of the time, this is understandably very important. So, twice every year, they contact AT&amp;T and have them set up a special conference. This is a very long and costly process, involving hours spent on the phone negotiating locations, prices and other tedious details.

CHEAPA has been doing this for years now.

Unbeknownst to the rest of the organization, my savvy father has been using Skype to do most of his phone calls because his apartment is in a phone coverage hole. So, every time he needs to call someone, he just pops in his earbuds and clicks on the contact on his laptop. It works very well.

As you may have deduced, my dad is surprisingly computer literate, especially with telecom stuff. This was his ultimate weapon when confronting the organizer.

**SF (Savvy Father):** Hey, I have a suggestion for our teleconferences.

**FSO (Frugal yet Stupid Organizer):** Sure, what do you have in mind?

**SF:** We've been using AT&amp;T telecons for a whole lot of money, there's a service on the Internet that provides teleconferences for free.

**FSO:** Free? Not a chance. AT&amp;T has been serving us well, we don't need some scammy company.

**SF:** \*pulls up telecon website\* No, see, right here. Very reputable. Give it a shot, you can set up a conference by calling XXX-XXXX. I have to go, but you can try it. Totally free.

**FSO:** I'll see. 


*a few days later....*


**FSO:** Told you! Completely useless! *rants about shady companies* (-1 IT point for FSO)

**SF:** What's the issue, exactly?

**FSO:** I called that number, XXX-XXXX, the one you gave me. Total silence! Nobody was there. Then some horrible music started playing, like I was on hold!

**SF:** Who did you ask to join the conference?

**FSO:** What?

**SF:** It's a tele*conference*. So that many people can be on the same call. So, again. Who did you have on there with you?

**FSO:** I don't know what you mean. I didn't have anyone! On AT&amp;T, you called them, they picked up the phone, and they talk to you! They never put me on hold!

**SF:** Wait. You called and nobody was there?

**FSO:** Yess!!!111!!!1!

**SF:** You called a *conference call.* You didn't ask anybody else join, so *there was nobody there.* There was nobody there, so nobody was talking.

**FSO:** You mean there wasn't anybody there?

**SF:** You didn't ask anyone to be there. You didn't invite anyone to join the call. Multiple people call the same number, and they end up on the same call.

**FSO:** \*prehistoric brain slowly cogitating\* ........oh.

**FSO:** \*click\*

**Setting** : I work as a technician in a company that specialized in IT-outsourcing, meaning that we have a bunch of different clients, with different needs and resources. I have been dispatched to work full-time with one of our clients, of which the staff is composed of mainly 45 years old and + accountants. So, you can understand what kind of joy it is to work with end-user issues at time.

From this crowd of sympathetic personae, a fine gentlemen (Let's call him Loud Gramps, **LG** for short) emerges from the rest. He is *absolutely* technically inept - and *absolutely* unwilling to admit it. Picture the kind that always asks, but never learns.

Onwards, he comes rushing towards my desk this morning, ready to blow the world apart with his eyes. As I was already dealing with one of our ESX servers going bonkers, I didn't feel like playing the role of **LG**'s steward, as I always end up doing (His desk is right next to mine, so whenever he has a problem - read, 3 times a day - he comes flying like a bullet.) The following conversation took place between the times of 9:37 AM and 9:40 AM.

**LG** : You! You're coming to my desk now - This stupid computer is messing with my files again! I'm about to throw all this crap off a bridge!

**Me** : What is going on exactly? (Thinking : *He's exaggerating, as usual... but he's even more aggressive than usual. Weird.*)

**LG** : I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT TO YOU, YOU HAVE TO COME AND SEE IT! (P.S.A. : He never, *ever* gave me an explanation of his problems. I always have to go and see it. *Sigh*, stand still, beloved ESX server containing our secondary DB, LG wants some tech support.)

*Arriving at the scene of the crime, I see nothing abnormal. Adobe Reader is open on his computer.*

**Me** : Alright, LG, show me what's going on.

**LG** : Okay. See, whenever I try to open a very important file, this stupid fucking computer tells me that it doesn't support it! Look! 

He then uses the ""Open..."" function of Adobe Reader, browses to the location of the file - select ""All Files"" from the drop-down menu on the pop-up. Already, the more astute of you see where this is going. From the files that appear (Now that he, as he told me while doing his operations, ""worked his magic to make the stupid program see his files"",) he selects an Excel spreadsheet. The dreaded error message appears.

**LG** : SEE! THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! THIS FILE HAS BEEN WORKING FOR 5 YEARS, AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S DOING NOW! FIX IT!

**Me** : (Trying my damned best not to collapse in laughter) Uhh, LG... Why are you trying to open an Excel spreadsheet with Adobe Reader?

**LG** : WHAT!? I always opened it that way! I need you to fix the program now!

**Me** : I've got a better idea. Where is this file located?

*Points me to the location on our shared drive*

**Me** : Perfect. See the icon on your file? It has a big green X with a spreadsheet in the back. Now, I'm guessing what you're trying to open is a spreadsheet, correct?

**LG** : Yes - but what does it even have to do with my problem!?

**Me** : It's very simple. You know the program Excel, right?

**LG** : Yes, but -

**Me** : Use Excel when you see the big green X on the files you're trying to open, files that have the .XLS extension.

**LG** : You haven't -

**Me** : Adobe Reader is for files that have the .PDF extension only.

**LG** : But... I *always* opened it that way.

**Me** : Are you certain? Because I can bet my next year of salary that Adobe Reader never opened any .XLS'. You must've opened it from Excel previously, but used Adobe Reader this time after looking at a .PDF.

**LG** : (Here's the kicker) Oh, you must be right... I haven't opened this file in over 3 months now.

KansasWizard,25,62,1nxf4k,51,"Hear a tale of the ISP run by a pyramid scheme corporation. 

/story time/

Once upon a time there was a company who specialized in stuff. Let's call them Shamway. Now Shamway was a busy little company who was not liked across the land for its methods of selling goods to it customers. Now some years before the government of the land had disciplined the company for being a big bad wolf, they decided that not only were they going to sell services, such as dial up internet services. 

Also in the land was a young apprentice wizard, who, needing training in the arts and coin for sustenance, joined with a local merchant house contracted to run the support for the dark company's ISP. Soon did he face trials and stood against the undead and the insomniacs working the night away for the Shamway. ( while in college I wanted to be at least be able to afford noodles, so I took an overnight position as a phone in support tech for an ISP run by a pyramid scheme.)

During the day, the merchant house was filled with skilled and unskilled workers, working on several different contracts for various companies including the Hell and also Hell Packed, with space for over 400 workers. ( During the day, the company had multiple service contracts running, but most of them were handed off to other call centers later in the day toward evening. the Q.N. contract being one of the few that stayed with the call center 24/7) 

'ere when the moon arose, only a handful remained within the walls to defend against the tide, the young wizard among them. There was Sir Kyle the Super, Lucas the Rogue of Level 2, and about 10 level one minions on rotating shifts in the whole merchant house. 

And lo it came to pass that the wizard befriended the Rogue and learned many tricks between rounds of battle with the hordes of Shamway. There were many tales like those that are told where ever we gather such as:

*""Yes, you do need to connect the phone cable to your computer and/or modem""*

*""You will need to have a modem installed to use the service""*

*""No, your password is not all stars""* 

*""I'm sorry your phone is calling Montana and you are in Missouri. No, we cannot refund you for the long distance charges, it says that every time you dial into the system.""*

*""Yes, you do need a computer to use the product you have been sold.""*

*""Your username is derp and your password has been reset to herpderp.""*

*""Yes ma'am you will need to be in front of your computer to complete the setup.""*

These low level battles prepared the young wizard for more stalwart foes of the Shamway, known as the Diamond People. These people had fallen under the lure of the company and drove unsuspecting people to their doom through the promise of gains and riches. 

*""Sir, you cannot dial out the same time I am talking to you if you do not have a second line no matter how many Diamonds you are.""*

*""Sir, you cannot use that language even if you are the regional diamond leader, once more and your call will be disconnected.""*

Kevin the Super would descend from his tower now and again to survey the call times, but did not partake in battle for he was a lout and a pus filled cesspit, with care only for call lengths and resolution tickets. Verily if one asked for a supervisor, ye would be tossed from minion to minion until thine head spun. As this was normally a Diamond person anyway, we did not care for their attitudes suck eggs. 

The Shamway dialer application was a festering pox, and did crash constantly for no good reason, and for many bad ones. Integrates email and browser all in one system, like the old AOHELL or JUNOOOOOO systems of the time. It would dial long distance by default, and pose cryptic messages instead of line busy or no dial tone. 

The favorite tale of the young wizard was actually one of hope though. One night when Kevin was home with the plague, or so one hopes, the wizard took a call from an elder who reminded the wizard of his own elders and thus he did above the call of duty. 

She did not know the ways of the rodent or the board of keys, but was willing to learn in order to send a missive to the progeny of her children. So it was performed by ritual the entry of the name and password, the connection of phone to local principalities, and the appropriate sacrifices to the electronic messenger gods that they would transport her missive henceforth to her bloodline. 

Though the wizard was chastised for the length and girth of his call, the lack of all other calls at the time saved him from being fed to the dragon of HR that day. 

And that, my friends, is some tales from the wizard's past, hastily written and posted for your pleasure. If you will excuse me, I just got a tech support ticket about a ghost in the front lobby TV. I sent in a request for a proton pack, and it was approved if I store it offsite.

This one is not terribly long I'm afraid, but more posts will be forthcoming. 


I currently work for a non profit specializing in helping kids deal with issues, and I do love working here, but my users are as special as I have had anywhere. 


Take, for example, a recent ticket of mine. 


Ticket Title: *email to local clinician bounced back*

Ticket Description: *This is a clinician that refers a lot of clients. Could you tell me why my reply bounced back and can this be fixed?*


* *screenshot of said email** ( You know, the error itself would have been more helpful ) 


* *screenshot of user's inbox** ( What is this supposed to show me besides that you have non company emails in your company inbox? )

Ok, I think, this should be easy enough, even though you did not give me any data that I needed, you gave me much more data than I wanted. 


The email, I learn, is a form that a local doctor has created herself to refer clients to the agency. It is sent *plaintext* from her AOHELL email account. 


If you aren't aware, **YOU CANNOT SEND CLIENT DETAILS THROUGH UNSECURED CHANNELS.** 

My user is trying to reply to the message... all of the message. 

Now some of you in the field know how much of a pain data security is. That why we have gateways to encrypt emails if they meet certain criteria. Usually this is transparent to the user, unless the encryption service is having an issue. Certain keywords or combinations of words or number patterns and the email gets zipped up tighter than the CFO's Wallet. 

So I walk over to the users desk to watch her email this clinician. She handles instruction face to face better than over the phone, and it's a small campus. 

Now remember, **YOU CANNOT SEND CLIENT DETAILS THROUGH UNSECURED CHANNELS**. 

So she shows me her method of dealing with this clinician, which is to reply to the whole email with 4 words. 

""Thanks for the referral.""

But since the whole previous message is still there, the Zix replies that it will not send that email to AOHELL.

I spend five minutes explaining the system (again) and show her that you don't have to send the confidential data back to the person. The light bulb came on, the email was sent, and I go back to my desk. 


Where there is an email from Zix stating they are having trouble encrypting to AOHELL addresses, of course.

The Linux CS teacher

I'm going to college to earn my CS majors, because being a low paid tech for my whole life isn't something I would like to do (no offence to you guys, you're awesome). My cs teacher, bless him, is a tiny 70 year old Indian man who wasn't intended to teach the class in the first place. He knows far to much for his own good, and tends to ramble (he 'taught' us name mangling in our second class). The problem is, I can tell he is a Unix/Linux teacher, as he has no clue how to use the mac/windows PCs the lab has, and when he does its unbearably slow. The first day he spent about 30 minutes trying to get a basic python GUI to start.

I was quite tired of all this wasted time, so I came up with a solution. I had a Raspberry Pi I wasn't using at the moment (tiny mini-pc, good for sandboxing and not much else). Before class, I had a talk with him and set it up with easy to use shortcuts and installs. (Chrome/IDLE/notepad++/dosbox/7zip/openoffice Pi distro) After showing it to him, I lent it to him with the condition that he assign all homework at the start of the class (I have to leave an hour early to catch the last bus). Lo and behold, now all classes flow much faster, and I've earned a fair bit of brownie points (And never have to email others to find out what the homework is, SCORE!)

My mom and right clicking

My mother, bless her heart, is partially tech-literate. She knows just enough to manage, but not much more than that. (READ: She can google and bookmark better than most, and she plays a mean game of hearts) A few days ago, I get called into the den/computer room after I hear her cursing at a website. She's managed to get onto a music sharing website, and can't for the life of her figure out how to download the songs. Whenever she would click the button that says 'download' nothing would happen.

Eligitine: ""Alright, let me try.""

Mom: ""No, if I don't do it I'll never learn.""

This is one of the problems my mom has with technology. She insists on doing everything herself, but never really grasps the concept of how to do things, or she learns JUST enough to mess up and call me. I bring my laptop into the room and teamviewer in (I've just learned its easier), and scroll through the site, trying a few (broken) links before I see a little tab that says 'options'. I click it, then click the new option 'direct download'. A new window pops up full of gibberish. 

I pause for a moment, then realize what the website did. The poor web designer for whatever reason I believe hosted the contents of the file as a .html file. I then right click 'direct download' and click 'save as', and Lo and behold, it worked!

Mom: How did you do that Eligtine?

Eligitine: I right clicked direct download and saved as a .wav

Mom: Let me try

She clicks on options, then left clicks on direct download, understandably annoyed by this point.

Eligitine: Now right click.

Mom: Alright *does same thing as before* Why won't it work?

At this point I pause and get up, taking my mom's pointer finger and move it to the right mouse button, then press down. A look of surprise crosses her face, and she exclaims something that will stay with me for a long time.

Mom: That works? I always thought they (the buttons) were the same thing!

I can't help myself, and burst into muffled laughter, leaving the room as my mom downloads her files, the situation solved. Thus ends the story of how my mom learned of the mysterious left side of the mouse.",Right click and Raspberry Pi,129

MysticBlackmoon,19,19,1nwtyk,93,"The tale I am about to impart to you fine people is a fairly regular occurrence here; this makes it no less taxing, as you can imagine, and this particular instance is essentially the ultimate example of this type of call. That it came in as my first call of the day did not help at all.

I'm in tech support at a reasonably-sized company-- first-level call center bullshit, really. Purely internal calls, so we don't have to deal with customers so much as we have to deal with employees who can destroy the system from the *inside*. We have a tool installed in our images of Windows called, quite succinctly, ""Support Information"" that is meant to make the lives of both the users and the techs much easier by just being a one-click access to your computer name, IP address, and a couple other nifty things. In practice, however...

Well, a user is lucky enough to give me my first call of the day. I go through the whole opening routine, and ask what his issue is; he says something about his Microsoft Office Communicator not working, and giving a message about ""keeping information in sync"". Not something I recognize, so I ask him if I could remote into his computer to take a look. He complies, and that is where the call takes a turn for the facepalmy.

&gt;""What do I type in to get my information?""

&gt;""Well, to get to the Support Information, you can type 'support' into the search bar on the Start menu.""

&gt;""'Command Line Support Add-On Documentation', is that the program?""

&gt;""No, it's going to be in the list as Support Information.""

&gt;""Is it 'Help and Support'?""

&gt;""No, sir, it's *Support Information*.""

&gt;""I'm not seeing that.""

Alright, I figure, let's try something else. There's no chance that it's not installed on his image, and I figure he's not reading over things carefully enough, so I guide him through getting into his command prompt and running ipconfig. This is, for some reason, much simpler for him.

After all that, I manage to connect to his computer, and I ask him where he was seeing those messages, or what Communicator might be doing. All he'll tell me, despite my repeated attempts at clarity, is that MOC ""isn't working"". I try to check it out, to see if I can replicate *any* sort of problem at all; it's in the system tray, it's running, it opens without a hitch, and hell, it's even opening faster than I'm used to.

&gt;""Sir, it doesn't look like anything is wrong with MOC.""

&gt;""Oh, the icon for it wasn't showing up down there before.""

*Thank you,* I think to myself, *I wish you had told me that in the beginning when I asked you to. Not that it does either of us any good now.* Just to double check, of course, I ask about the ""sync info"" message he was getting.

Naturally, it was an automated system message telling him he should sync his computer with the data on our network.

In the end, the ticket was closed as ""no fault found"".

They also want us to drop everything if someone's CAPS LOCK key is turned on.

I've been slowly and secretively teaching people that if they want help, they should email our help account so it gets autologged in the system.  I work with the door to the office open so that people can see me typing and think I'm doing something (the only thing missing is the green text on black background).  The method of training I've been using has been to ignore the workers in the next room when they say my name, forcing them to get up and ask me to fix the problem (the moment I hear my name I start to look busy).  

When they ask, I look them in the eye and tell them that I've got projects I'm working on, and if they would mind emailing so that I've got a reminder when I have a moment.  This has been working to an extent; the most guilty culprit of ""Skrae!

Here we go...

I was working a temp job a few months back setting up Wi-Fi access points across an entire site. Everything is going seamlessly so far, no problems, very nice.

Then one day I happen to be installing an AP on the ceiling in front of someone's office. This nice lady comes out to see what's going on with an inquisitive look on her face.

**Her:** Ooh, what are you doing?

**Me:** I'm setting up Wi-Fi points across the site so you can access the local network and internet anywhere with a wireless device.

*(Now at this point, I realise my mistake. I said anywhere instead of anywhere on-site. I'm expecting to have to go back on my words and spend a good half hour explaining the concept of signal range etc... But then, this happened...)*

**Her:** My computer is really slow at the moment, is this going to speed it up? *(Hopeful, inexplicable look of joy spread across her face)*

**Me:** Uhh, N-

**Her:** Thanks!

She then proceeds to prance off and I do not see her for the rest of the day. Then as the day is coming to an end I see her approach from a distance. Here I am expecting the whole *""My computer is still slow, why didn't you fix it?! blah blah blah crap""* But yet again, she surprises me!

**Her:** Hello! Thank you so much! My computer is so much faster now, it was starting to do my head in.

**Me:** Uhhh...? *You're welcome?*

She then gives me a beaming smile and walks off, happy as ever.

Now, before you ask, it wasn't her internet that sped up due to the closer AP because she had a fixed workstation connected via Ethernet. I can not however, complain.

- - - - -

Things had settled down over the weekend. My fiancee and I had enjoyed a night of fine jazz, some good wine, snuggles - you know, the finer things in life.

Monday morning, I arrived at my new office, and pulled up right as my boss did... and helped him unload the components from Fry's for my new desktop.

He showed me the office, told me to help myself to anything in the break room (and since there were some excellent bagels and a Keurig coffeemaker, I couldn't but oblige his generous offer), and presented me with the parts. He seemed surprised that I brought my own monitors, especially since he'd brought two Asus LED panels for me, but then again, I'm kind of a stickler about that - anything less than 1920x1080 simply won't do for a machine I'm expected to work on 40 hours a week.

After about an hour and a half (and with liberal use of expletives and a few cups of coffee), [my new machine was assembled](http://imgur.com/a/BLfHb#0). For a work box, the specs were pretty tasty - an i5-3470, a GeForce GTX 660, a 256GB Sandisk SSD, and he even bought a Corsair H55 water-cooling kit for me, too.

[Considering my previous cube](http://imgur.com/a/tf2k5#3), this was a massive improvement.

A quick installation of Win7 Pro x64 later, and I was off on my way into Spiceworks, working on tickets.

Later that day, I found out my new projects that would keep me busy for several months. Among them were full network audits for each client we had, plus the creation and implementation of a proper CRM system, the creation and maintenance of an imaging system, a custom Windows PE repair and recovery environment, and imaging, testing, and deploying 451 Dell Latitude 10 tablets with Windows 8 to a high school we ran IT for. With a smirk, I fired up DISM on my box, and marveled at how fast it went.

Several days passed, and I settled into the rhythm of the new job in my corner office, set back in a heavily wooded area in the Barton Creek Greenbelt in southwest Austin. The caffeine ran freely, and I met the other techs and sysadmins over those days and our company-paid lunches. My old friend and I would be sharing an office once we renovated the server room and moved the rack elsewhere, and we were promised carte blanche to get what furniture we liked for it. 

Believe me, I made my plans, and Ergotron arms, walnut desks, and plush carpets featured into them quite heavily.

Of course, I received occasional texts and calls from techs back at the hospital chain. They were treated cordially and nicely, all of them, especially the ones who asked for tech support. 

There was, of course, one call that I was waiting for, that I knew would come, though all too reluctantly, as the caller would be prideful and loathe to admit he needed help.

And we all know who THAT was, yes?

Yes, the PFY was due to call any day now. If you think back, you'll remember that the fiancee and I spotted some things that would definitely cause him alarm when he noticed them - assuming he ever did, as his skill at scripting was equivalent to the average Tibetan yak's skill at water polo. Sure enough, the date in which the critical things would start happening was upon him, and one cool and rainy morning, after settling into my chair and turning on Pandora to my Stan Getz station, the distinctive ringtone I'd set for him echoed through the office.

""SWIPER NO SWIPING! SWIPER NO SWIPING! SWIPER NO SWIPING!""

I flicked my finger across the screen of my phone and put it on speaker as I picked up. ""NNNNNNNnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnhello?""

""Hi, Jack, it's $PFY_NAME_HERE. What's up?"" The PFY's voice was crackling and sounded distant - yep, he was on speakerphone, and that meant there were at least one or two other people listening in on the call in the same room.

""Oh, not much, not much,"" I spoke, sipping at my coffee and clicking around in Spiceworks. ""It's nice not to have to be on call 24 / 7 for things that are out of my control, you know? Being root again - this time with official blessings - is a good thing. And you?""

""Well, we're in the middle of a massive rollout here, for a certain clinic - you know, that big one with 100 or so tablets that was your client at the company you were with before you came to us,"" he replied.

""Oh, you mean my baby. So, what's so urgent that you need me? The network admin from my prior company should be able to assist you with anything you all need for them, since he's running them now.""

There were a few seconds of silence on the other end of the line, and I continued. ""Given that you're calling me personally, I'm going to place a wager that this has something to do with something _I've_ done for them. Would I be right in saying so?""

""It's not so much what you've done for them,"" he said, continuing on in a calm voice. ""It's what you did before, and what we need done now.""

""I'm not sure I follow,"" I shot back, just as calmly. ""Would you mind clarifying, not merely for my benefit, but for the other people I know are in the room with you, since I can tell from the echo you're on speakerphone.""

I heard muttering for a few seconds, then a quiet thump or two, and his voice was magically clearer. ""Look, you know exactly what's going on.""

""I have a hunch. Let me guess. You've finally gotten canine herpes from the head of IT's shih-tzu?"" A sip of coffee went down my gullet before I shot off another reply. ""Or perhaps you've gotten your hands on what you perceived to be a MIRV warhead for a Soviet SSBM, but it turned out it really was an espresso maker?"" I sipped again. ""Or perhaps karma's finally biting you in the ass, hmm? Send them out of the room, or else they're going to hear EXACTLY what I have to say to you when I start yelling.""

Ten seconds passed, during which I could hear the PFY arguing with the others, and then he was back on speaker after a thud indicated the door closing.

""Fine. Jack, spit it out, or nut up and swallow it.""

""I didn't know you were an Archer fan,"" I replied, nonplussed, as I crossed my arms across my chest. ""You know that I know what you did. You're on your own to fix it, ESPECIALLY since I saw what you did to it.""

""The hell are you talking about? I didn't do anything wrong.""

""Plagiarism is bad, mmmkay? Don't try to deny it, it's very distinctively my code, and stripping the credits from it was a naughty thing to do. Taking a buggy development version and claiming it was yours was an even worse idea. You know that the one you copied was marked 'DEV USE ONLY' for a reason, right? I had added in several features... well, it's moot now, it's your problem.""

""Jack, seriously, please - ""

""Don't you DARE beg me for help. You plagiarized, lied, and made them think it's YOUR code. YOU can be the superhero and fix it.""

""Office isn't activating on any of the tablets!"" The desperation in his voice was evident. ""The VPN client is broken on every single one of them, it's spitting back errors about not being a recognized asset! They don't ever go to sleep or hibernate, not one of them! And worst of all, Dragon doesn't even point to the right server! I have to touch every single machine to fix it!""

""Oh, so you're basically having to do real work because you can't fix what you fucked up?"" The derision in my voice was evident, and the caffeine was only fueling the snark I was feeling. ""Not my fault you can't fix this, and you still haven't given me a reason to bail your ass out of the fire.""

""A bottle of Glenlivet,"" he said, desperation evident in his voice. ""Glenlivet 18. Isn't that what you said you liked?""

""I prefer recognition for my creation far more,"" I replied, finality in my voice.

""Come on, Jack, there's got to be some way that we can both get what we want here,"" he begged.

""I'm going to be frank. Nothing you have could POSSIBLY make me inclined to help you, and even reporting any and all suspected policy and AUP violations on my part wouldn't gain you a damn thing, since I'm gone. HOWEVER, I could always point out to the IS security team that as people like us could potentially have access to eClinicalWorks with multiple accounts, what with us being able to shoulder-surf users during deployments, and my, it's amazing what scripts one can write for oneself with credentials from other users, as that would evade the audit trail, especially for interesting things like, oh, tramadol. In fact, I daresay that a user who has our skill level with it and sufficient creativity - well, they could mark someone as a recreational drug addict in eClinicalWorks, then tag them as being positive for, oh, say, HIV or some other nasty little disease. Tuberculosis, perhaps? Something that has a one-week report requirement to the county board of health. And my, that could most definitely affect one's standing - false records would be an absolute nightmare to remove, and the complications - why, if they could affect someone's custody battle, that's beyond the pale, isn't it, let alone the repercussions that could occur from someone being unethical enough to actually do such things, considering that EVERYTHING is traceable one way or another, and I'm able to offer my skills as a forensic analyst if necessary?""

""You utter fucking bastard,"" he hissed into the phone.

""Now, now, behave yourself. You're in a Catholic institution,"" I retorted. ""We're speaking in hypotheticals only, of course. I've no desire to screw things up. That's your job, you know, since you can't script worth a damn. Of course, if you had simply taken the production script version I had instead of the dev one, all of this would have been avoided.""

""So you're just going to leave me out in the cold, then?""

""I wouldn't say leave you out in the cold. No, it's more like the time I was in Japan - you know, when what was [a clear day](http://imgur.com/a/VDlvX#0) took nine minutes to turn into [an absolute shitstorm of a blizzard](http://imgur.com/a/VDlvX#1) where I blew out both knees and only survived because vending machines sell cans of hot coffee? Yeah, more like that."" I swallowed the last of my coffee and flipped the phone over, hanging my finger over the big red disconnect button. ""Maybe if you're lucky you'll find the metaphorical coffee machine that saves your ass.""

""Jack, you son of a - ""

My finger jabbed down on the button, and the call hung up.

I leaned back in my chair, muted the ringer, and got up. A quick walk to the fridge yielded a bottle of Chameleon Cold-Brew, and I poured a mug of it, sans water and dilution. Upon return to my comfy chair, I sipped victoriously at it, with the melodic strains of Blossom Dearie playing over my speakers. 

The PFY hadn't pained me since.

All was well.

Techsupportvictim,189,593,1nw09i,1057,"Okey dokeys. It's Sunday at the big brand tech store. Shorter hours, shorter tempers. Oh joy.

So in comes DudeBro all swagger and such. Now we run by appointment and given we were closing in like 30 minutes with every appointment checked in, a 'slip you in' just wasn't going to happen. Especially since our system adds an extra queue for every 3 techs. So we had 4 techs each with 3 appointments (they are ten minutes) and 3 extras. All there. Yeah it's stupid but our managers just don't see the problem. 

I'm in 'hostess' if you will. Trying to get everyone served for their brand company phone or tablet 

I greet DB and he immediately launches into this profanity filled tirade about how his phone which he just got brand new is an f piece of s, how he doesn't want to hear any F BS about needing an appointment, how we were going to give him a new one blah blah. He's got an entourage of a couple of his dude pals with him and his girl who looks like she is probably a stripper in that get up.

I make the call that I'm going to try to help him since the techs have their list of names etc. So I ask him what specially is the issue. And he manages with several f bombs to tell me that he just picked up the phone at a carrier store cause we can't seem to have them in (they just came out about a week ago and anyone that knows our brand knows that EVERYONE wants one yesterday so we stay basically sold out for the first month). Right there that blows retail swap as an option even if we had it. And even though they haven't been out long enough for refurbs to exist he's yelling about he doesn't want one of the f'ing refurbs we pawn off on folks that come for service).

More bombs later he finally spits out that he can't make phone calls. My first thought is perhaps the carrier system was backed up and it hasn't activated or he was porting the number to a new carrier. Until he says, many more bombs, that he can dial the number but can't hear an f'ing thing unless he puts it on speaker phone which is f'ing ridiculous and he doesn't want the world to hear his f'ing business.

Now I'm getting an idea. So I ask real nicely if I can take a look at his phone. Once I get it in my hands I very calmly tell him that his behavior is childish and deplorable and if he ever comes into my store again acting like that I will see to it that he's banned not just from my store but every brand store in the area. I say it low, straight face and firmly enough that he doesn't think to question that I'm not a manager. Given I was kind of (nicely) bossing the tech staff around I was hoping he'd make that assumption.

Then I pull the dang shipping plastic off the front of the phone, hand it to him and tell him it's fixed. His pals were off looking at a demo but the stripper babe is right there and sees the whole thing. From the look on her face he's not getting any this month. 

He says nothing so I just say 'you're welcome' and then as he walks away I kind of loudly say something to the tune of 'and you might want to take the one off the back or all your mirror selfies will come out looking like they were shot by a drunk with cataracts' ",Wherein I made a ranting dudebro look like a moron in front of a hot chick,1650

The customer had already re-installed a couple times, but had botched it each time.  We managed to get the computer going, and went to activate it, only to be told it could not be activated.  This was one of those laptops with the win8 key as part of the motherboard, and had no physical key on it.  So we bite the bullet, and call up Microsoft support, only to be told that for windows 8, you can only activate the key 3 times, and then have to buy a brand new key at full retail.  After arguing at length with the technician that this should be an authorized re-activation, we gave up and issued the customer a windows 7 key instead (which he approved).  Fortunately, there wasn't further issue, but the whole thing left a bad taste in our mouths.  Guess who **won't** be recommending Windows 8 any time soon...

Get an email today when someone replied to a password reset email. About 60% of the replies are the new password, 20% are claims that it ""didn't work"" which means their browser has a cache/cookie issue or their password wasn't strong enough, 10% are complaints that our requirements are ""bullshit"" and the last 10% are unrelated support questions or concerns.

A hosting account is storage space for a website, and we also offer email. Insecure passwords lead to phishing, malware, viruses, spam and blacklisting, you name it. We take that seriously. So we enforce ""strong"" requirements. Uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols have to be in it, and it has to be at least 8 characters long. ""One 2 3 4 5"" scores a 100/100 on our strength meter, so it's seriously NOT hard to make a strong password.

Inevitably there is some customer that is just not happy with that. ""Let me have my password! It's my account, let me protect it from hackers with the equivalent of a [baby gate](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/05/article-2356891-1AADAE61000005DC-767_634x485.jpg) if I want to!"" 

Sorry, but no. Hacking causes sooooo many calls to tech support because people have stupid passwords like Password2012! or use out of date software. If we lowered the strength requirements, those calls would increase dramatically. Screw that!

So this guy responds to the password reset email. **""You guys are rookies! Let me have my password! It is my password and not yours! Bunch of rookies!""** and something about closing the page which I think was a threat to cancel his account. *Oh dear, what ever would we do if that happened?! We would go absolutely bankrupt without your spare change!* /s 


I kindly reply with our strength requirements, our spiel about why protecting your stuff is important, and a few links to suggestions on how to make strong passwords and [this awesome tool](http://dfcb.github.io/manly-man-passwords/) someone linked me to today. Genuinely trying to be nice and say, sorry, I know it can be annoying but we can't compromise on these requirements.

**""Trite password restrictions... rookies!""**

LOL! Okay whatever. I reply and tell him that giving a crap about security doesn't necessarily make us rookies, and he can either make a compatible password to log into his account again, or he can ignore it and not use his account, or he can cancel it.

ComputerGeek01,32,15,1numj3,100,"So it's been awhile since my last submission involving my cow-orker Skippy, and I wish I could say that is because he has been getting better but sadly that is just not the case. Most of his cringe inducing behavior comes in the form of asinine comments that he makes through out the day, one example is the story he tells us about how his uncle took his speed boat up to Alaska and how the US Navy shot a torpedo at him for getting too close to a ""Top Secret Base""; and other impossibly terrible tall tails like that. But on to the technical stuff.

Now, none of us likes dealing with printers. I personally believe that Mr. Bill Gates most evil act in life has nothing to do with Windows, it was his undelivered promise to us of a paperless office. So despite his obvious ineptitude in the fields of every thing else you can forgive me for sending Skippy to clear a paper jam on one of our larger units a few months ago, he is after all still the FNG. Now because I do not have the fingers of a 10-year old Asian, I often find it helpful to use a pair of pliers to pull out the more stubborn little bits of paper. I therefore suggested to Skippy the use of my personal set of pliers which he gratefully accepted. He takes two tools from my desk and leaves (Now feels like an appropriate time to mention that I leave all of my tools in cases for easy transport, so it is especially strange that he did not take the entire sets with him). 

Up until this point it's been a pretty slow day and I am amusing myself by setting up a row of parallel capacitors for some amusement later on. Since I am salvaging these parts from broken equipment I reach for the case that I keep my side cutters in and I find that they aren't there. This isn't unusual at first since we are pretty good about sharing tools so I ask the other guys in my office but nobody has them. I look again at my case and see that the needle nose pliers are still there and I pause. It is at this point I feel my spine go cold and I start experiencing audible hallucinations, that clicking noise that HDD's make when they die started coming from inside of my head saying: ""No, it can't be ... he didn't"" &lt;CLICK&gt; ""No, it can't be ..."" &lt;CLICK&gt; ""No, it can..."". I shoot up out of my desk and sprint across our floor to the commercial grade printer that had the paper jam. I see Skippy sitting at an unoccupied desk around the corner stabbing at the now completely disassembled feed roller with my side cutters. 

Me: ""WHAT ARE DOING!?""

Skippy: ""AH! Geek, you scared me. I'm just clearing the paper jam like you told me to.""

Me: ""With my wire cutters?""

Skippy: ""You said it was alright if I used your tools. What? Why are you looking at me like that?""

I now lose my ability to speak, how do you respond to someone like this? How do you teach someone who is too oblivious to read the digital display that tells you where the paper jam is and how to clear it? I was too late, he had already lost two proprietary sized screws along with a spring and the roller was kinked in a dozen different places from where he had stabbed it with my flat head screw driver. The $3K printer that we had **leased** was now an absurdly expensive paper weight. The only thing he had to say was: ""Don't we have a service contract on it?"". He repeated this several times for the next few minutes before he realized that we had all heard him and were choosing not to respond.

As punishment we all agreed that it is only fair that he be the one to tell our receptionist exactly *why* they would be without a printer until I could scrounge up parts from E-bay so that we don't end up having to pay the leasing company the retail cost of the unit (yes, we did manage to pull his ass out of the fire. It was a team effort). The story he ended up telling was that the printer had broke because the receptionist was ""printing with staples ..."" and that this had damaged the roller. To confirm you suspicion, yes the jam was in the feed roller for the paper tray on the opposite end of the machine from the collator. 

A few other smaller stories:

I at one point thought it would be beneficial to teach Skippy how to write in ~~Pearl~~ ~~PERL~~ Perl, this being the scripting language that everyone else in the office has a common understanding of. This lead to questions such as ""Why doesn't the loop work if I put a semicolon at the end?"", ""What is a function?"", ""What does the command 'open' do?"" and my favorite, after he got *frustrated with learning Pearl* ""Don't you write stuff in C++? Why don't I learn that instead?"". I also had to physically take his 'Insert' key away because he thought he had to hold it down in order to insert text in Notepad++.

We have an upright vacuum cleaner in our office because, despite my objections before it was put in, my office is carpeted (a nice dark color so that you don't stand a chance of seeing any dropped screws unless you lay your head parallel with the floor). So we asked Skippy to run the carpet over a few times to pick up what ever clutter my supervisor thought he saw. Here is the [model](https://www.google.com/search?q=dirt+devil+ultra+swivel+glide&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WZVRUpGdJ4ez4APHqIGwCQ&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=879&amp;dpr=1) we have. Skippy couldn't figure out how to unlock the handle from the upright position, so instead of asking for help, looking it up or spending more then ten seconds trying to figure it out he crouches down and starts pushing it from the bottom. We don't have a small office, so this caused all four of us to stop working and watch this display of ... I don't know what ... ingenuity? In a rare show of humor my supervisor waited for Skippy to finish cleaning the entire office this way (in which time several people walked in to ask for help only to spot him doing this and forget why they came in) before showing him what button to push in order to use it like a normal person would.","""They Never Taught Us That In College"" Part II",115
brerrabbitt,41,21,1num5n,99,"While I am not IT nor do I work primarily with computers, I do handle tech support issues.

I'm an Electronics Tech by trade and work in a number of fields. Industrial automation is one, fire alarm systems is another.

Think of people in my trade as being what every good little IT person wants to be when they grow up. There is nothing more satisfying than finishing up a job, pressing a button, and watching a few tons of machinery start moving around under the direction of the operator or a PLC.

And speaking of IT....

There had been constant strife between us and IT due to several issues. 

One of the most common being that their updates would often render the software that we used to handle hardware nonfunctional. Another that ground our gears was them constantly taking over electrical rooms and placing their locks on them in strict violation of code. The firemen might need to get in there to shut down a panel if the building is of fire, and this would delay them, it also delayed us if we needed to work in the room as well.

Their explanation was that rules were rules. It did not matter that the only thing my laptop ever interfaced with was a PLC, alarm system, or other type of electronics device, they were mandated to update our laptops even if the updates rendered our computers useless. The same for the electrical rooms, they were now secure areas, but out of the goodness of their little black hearts, they would let us in if we scheduled a time a week or so in advance.

I received a trouble call for the fire alarm system in the building that they worked out of one day. It seemed that many people could not hear the fire alarm when it actuated.

I did a building walk around after announcing that I was testing the system. I put the system in alarm and did in fact find that the alarm could not be heard in many areas of the building. This was due to post construction renovations that split several large rooms into smaller ones.

An evil thought entered my mind. I pushed it back, but it kept sliding towards the forefront.

I looked at how much conduit I would have to run and figured a cool shortcut that met code and would make the shop look like we had entered the 21st century.

The building had a post construction mass notification system installed that conveniently had a fire message recorded on it.  One single conduit run, a control relay and a bit of rewiring and the building, except for the IT spaces was up to code. If the fire alarm actuated, instead of bells, they would now hear the calm voice of a woman telling them to evacuate the building because of a fire.

The IT spaces... The lovely quiet, extremely well air conditioned IT spaces... . Yup, the bastards made me schedule a time before I could work in there to finish up the job. I would feel no guilt over what I now had to do. 

I'm an evil bastard at heart. 

Instead of switching their audibles from bells to a speaker repeating the recorded message, it was a matter of minutes to change the alarm bells to their highest setting. They would no longer merely alert you to a fire, but would now drive you from the spaces holding your ears in pain.

Air conditioning? Hmm, that needs to go off by code when a fire alarm is initiated. I even had a wiring panel in the same room as their AC. It was but the work of a few minutes to bring this up to code as well.

And to ensure the safety of the IT personnel, I wired it up with a manual interlock that had to be pressed to restart the IT's air conditioning system. By gosh, this was a safety issue! Who is going to argue against that?

Pity the reset for the interlock was in an electrical box that only our shop had the keys to.

I tested out the system and bagged ass out of their building before anyone realized what I had done.

It brought a smile to my face every time they called our shop after a fire drill to restart their AC system. 

My boss would simply reroute the call to me if I was in the shop and I would ask them when they would like to schedule an appointment to reset their system. 

That that did not last as long as I would have liked, they whined to the big boss, but I did my best to take my time responding to their emergency loss of cooling to their servers.

Rules are rules after all.

I'm not a tech support guy, but I do build my own computers, create some small programs using Visual Basic, stuff like that.

So my dad calls me up and says something is wrong with the computer. D = Dad M = Me

D: I think there's something wrong with my computer.

M: Could you give a little more detail than that??

D: Every time I turn the computer on it comes up with 2 windows 7 choices.

Ah. I used to use this computer and the main OS was on a small OCZ Agility SSD which was quite small (120GB). I also found out that there was almost 2GB of hard drive space left because of all the stuff he's downloaded. I shit you not, my dad has downloaded 14 toolbars and they take up almost all of the internet explorer page.

I proceed to remove the old Windows 7 OS on the other HDD. 

D: This is too confusing for me. Just take the other hard drive out.

M: you're almost out of space. I'll format the other hard drive so you have 500GB of extra space.

D: why would I need that? I can just download extra hard drive space.

At this point I've lost all of the little patience I have and just remove the hard drive from the PC like he asked, with only 2 gigs of space left. He won't last long with his torrenting habits.

Edit: My dad has run out of HDD space. He called me asking if I could put another hard drive in. I said no. I'm out of town and won't be back at my dad's house for 2 months. That should teach him.

rhymes_with_chicken,145,268,1nubbw,913,"I'm a bit of a gun-for-hire. I wear a lot of different hats for different clients/customers. Two days of the week I'm technically *Marketing Director* for a very low budget outfit (4 full-time employees) in town. Even though they have an outside IT department that is responsible, if I'm in the office I'll handle mundane things like turning on a second monitor, replacing batteries in wireless mice, or tapping the numlock key A) because I'm there and qualified to do so and B) in the words of my boss, I'm cheaper. Whatever, I'm hourly. As long as I'm not talking to retail customers, or in direct contact with fecal matter I'll use any skill in my possession at the negotiated rate. It's often a welcome change of pace anyway.

So, there's one user that's absolutely notorious for ruining machines. And, by ruining I mean utterly infecting the drive with every known bit of mal and/or bloatware. Show him a link, and he'll click it. Deliver him a payload, and he'll accept it, open it, install it, fork over his SSN. If there's a device in place to stop it, he'll unblock it. In two years, he's had 5 new workstations delivered to his desk.

Why is this tolerated? He's the boss' elderly father.

Great guy. Everyone in the office gets along great with him. He's very stereotypically grandfatherly. Personable on the phone. Good guy to have a beer with. Just not the greatest with computers.

The official IT company is no help really. It's in their best interests to bill for new machines when fixing the old one would be more billable hours. They're doing us a ""favor"".

Mention imaging a drive to them and it's like the conversation never happened. Not my place to make recommendations like that anyway. Trying to explain the concept to anyone else in the building is like trying to teach a cat algebra (and IT knows this).

The situation does take him down for extended periods, though. And, it affects business. The IT co is offsite. When he fouls a machine, it's at least a day or more for a loaner to show, plus downtime while it's being installed. Then repeat the process when the new machine is ready. And, he is tier one customer service.

Two months ago he took down another machine. My boss (the owner) is visibly and audibly agitated. After IT installs the new machine, he berates his father loudly in the office. This is completely unprofessional, inappropriate, and embarrassing and awkward for everyone present. After he simmers down I offer him a solution.

me: Would you like me to handle this permanently?
him: Yes!
me: Done.

That's really all the approval I needed. I grabbed a 2-machine KVM and a 10' CAT5 patch cable out of the supply closet, the last 'ruined' machine, and loaded the latest build of hexxeh's chromiumOS build to a flash drive. tucked all that shit up under the user's desk and booted to the flash drive.

Told grandpa ""if you want to use the internet you just have to tap the control button twice"". Stood there and watched him toggle back and forth a couple of times. ""Got it? Good.

Gadsden,29,116,1ntrv7,452,"Back in the late 90's I worked for an ISP start up in a small town with a handful of other people.

One of these people was named Larry. Larry was an interesting person with a real gift for acting goofy. Picture Norm MacDonald. I loved working with this guy.

These were the days of BackOrifice (a back door program for Windows machines which was pretty easy for anyone to use and infect other machines with), and it seemed everyone was playing with it.

I had set up our Linux based router with some special scripts to react to certain nefarious network activities automatically. I would get an ICQ message describing what was detected, the ip address it came from, what action it took based on that information, and if it was something interesting (either really bad, or internal to our own network) it would play a wav file of an air-raid siren over a rather impressive set of speakers. I've never been one to police people's activities beyond our network, but if someone was attacking my servers in any way that was going to make my life and job more difficult, I was going to do what I could to return the courtesy.

I had told my co-workers that I had put some automated security measures on the server, but I never told them what they did exactly.

One day, I was sitting there doing my job, along with everyone else, and I hear the infamous ICQ ""uh oh"" message as the air-raid siren starts to play, grabbing everyone's attention. They all look at me.

I look at my ICQ message which tells me that the guy sitting behind me scanned our network with BackOrifice.

I turned around, smiling and knowing full well what happened, to see Larry sitting there.

Jadaba,16,36,1nthvz,73,"Greetings TFTS! I guess this is less of a tale and more of a rant, so I surrender myself to the mercy of the mods.

To give a little background, I purchased a Macbook early this year so that I would have something that would be more or less reliable (read: locked, because I like to tinker) because my schoolwork is pretty important. I also recently purchased a Time Capsule because backups are a wonderful thing. As a joke, I named my Time Capsule's WiFi networks THE TWERK ZONE (2.4GHz) and MATH CITY BITCH (5GHz). 

My mother came home today to visit (I live in our house, while she effectively lives with her fiancee), and I receive a text message during my lunch break asking for the ""other wifi connections passwords"". Our main router, a Linksys E3000, is outputting a 2.4GHz network entitled Linksys and a 5GHz network entitled Cisco5.

&gt; Me: The Cisco5 password is herpidyderp

&gt; Mom: I want math city bitch &amp; twerk zone passwords please. There is no Cisco5

...How the hell can you see MCB but not Cisco5? I still have yet to solve this mystery.

I then proceed to tell her that because my bridge (the capsule just creates a wireless network and doesn't serve DHCP. That's left to the Linksys) is behind our main router that she's already connected to, it won't solve any issues. I then tell her that she probably just needs to reset the modem and router **because we had a small Derpcast outage last night, and could be having another one today**. I also mention that giving her the passwords would also allow her (really just her fiancee, as my mother doesn't own a Mac) access to the data I store on the capsule in addition to backups.

&gt;Mom: So what's the problem with me having access to your data?

I'm lost for words. She knows how big into security I am these days, majoring in MIS with plans to get a masters in cryptology in addition to talking anyone's ear off that makes the mistake of getting me started on the NSA.

&gt;Mom: If your files are private, they should be password protected shouldn't they? Having access to a ROUTER shouldn't allow everyone access to your computer. I want access to ALL internet connections that I'm paying for.

Oh, okay. I don't think she's ever heard of the concept of a NAS before this (especially a fancy shmancy one such as the Time Capsule), so I understand. I proceed to explain this concept to her, and I explain that because the NAS is physically part of what creates my network, my network password is my NAS password. I also explain that my network does not use a second internet connection, it piggybacks on the one passing through the main router.

&gt;Mom: &lt;fiancee&gt; and I both ALWAYS have problems with the internet at my house and I'm sick of it. I want a (relatively) problem-free internet connection when I'm here. That's what I'm supposedly paying Derpcast for. If you are compromising that then you need to rectify it.

We've had this discussion before, when I set up the Minecraft/Teamspeak server. For some reason, I never have a problem with any part of the network when she isn't here. Funny how only she has problems when she's here, isn't it?

I proceed to outline that if she ""ALWAYS"" has problems, then it can't be related to my networks because she's had issues before they existed. I promise that I will rectify the situation when I get home from work, and even let her know that I am unable to VNC into my server, so either the modem or main router are at fault, because the server does not lie inside my personal network.

&gt;Me: I am no longer on lunch. I will contact you when I am off work and everything has been rectified.

&gt;Mom: Yes everything seems to be working fine now.

Those last two text messages happened 3 minutes apart.

He pulled the fuse for the system and checked it with the multimeter which showed zero resistance (for those of you unfamiliar with electronics a working fuse should have zero resistance, when they blow they go open circuit or infinite resistance to stop the flow of electricity).

Day 1- **Welcome to the rest of your life**

When I was a student taking my happy little I.T. courses, we would service computers in the school from actual customers. (Gave us a LOT of experience this way) It was probably my third week into the course where I receive a laptop from a customer about having problems with the keyboard and track pad. I take a look at it, I open it up, turn it on and sign in to the users profile. After a brief minute I did notice the track pad wasn't really working correctly. That's when I plugged in the USB mouse, opened up notepad and started typing. The keyboard was working fine. I was a bit confused on this part. But noticing the track pad wasn't working correctly I took the laptop and began servicing it. The user walks away at this point.

I begin opening up the laptop, taking a look at the track pad wiring. I noticed it wasn't fully seated inside, so I re-adjusted it, put the laptop back together and cleaned the track Pad. It's now working fine. The confusing part was the keyboard. I typed every letter, including shifting, capslock, etc. Nothing is appearing wrong, I'm basically lost at this point. I called the customer let them know the laptop is working fine now. 

Day 2- **The Day I Should've Called In Sick** 

As the curtain opens, in comes the user. I inform them of the trackpad being fixed. The customer asked ""what about the keyboard?"" Being honest (I learned this can be a fatal mistake in this field) I said ""I couldn't find anything wrong with it, it seems to be working fine."" Here is how it went:

User: ""What do you mean there is nothing wrong?""

Me: ""I typed out all of the keys in different combinations with zero problems, I couldn't find any errors.""

User: There is something wrong with it! It doesn't type the letters correctly!

Me: ""...""

User: ""Here, let me show you""

At this point the (l)user turns on the computer and opens word to being typing. The user is typing so fast that they keep striking the wrong keys. AT this point I realize it's a complete I-D-10-T error, and they simply cannot handle typing quickly. 

Her: ""SEE? IT TYPES INCORRECTLY!""

Me: **light bulb shines brightly above my head** Let me take another look for you, give me the rest of the day to look at it.

(l)user agrees and leaves for the day. I put it aside and leave it alone for the entire day. 

Day 3: **Calibration always works** ^Enter ^the ^user ^again

User: ""Did you fix it?""

Me: ""I did, now here is the trick to it, I had to calibrate your keyboard, it's a very long process- we have to manually do it key by key. What I suggest it typing a bit easier, maybe not as fast- unfortunately with these particular models the keyboards tend to get off calibrated easily. Unfortunately you can't type on them like a normal desktop keyboard, you have to be gentle with it. 

User: **sits down and starts typing slower into word** Well, look at that, it works great now! Thank you!!! Should I bring my other laptops in for a calibration.

I've spent hours with her and them on the line testing every possible thing however unlikely. Her ISP says it's us, and we've essentially proven it isn't. The conclusion was me giving her some forwarding options to work around the issue and to consider requesting a higher level agent at her ISP.

BrockN,2,13,1nrgpl,55,"I provide support to quite a few facility including a food manufacturing plant and I'm strictly a hardware technician but I am flexible with that if I know about the software.

About 2 months ago, the manager of a plant had emailed me requesting to setup a software on the computer located in the conference room for the purpose of showing things to the auditor. I turned him down for several reasons: 

1. I'm strictly a hardware technician, there is a IT workgroup whose job is dealing with those kind of request. 

2. I'm unfamiliar with the software and do not have access to the installation CD or the instructions to set it up properly.

3. There's a process to follow and emailing me is not the process. I told him what was the correct procedure and that these kind of software request are typically completed quickly.

Since he never responded, I assumed that he got it figured out and was fine.

Well, guess what? I got a email from him on Monday saying that he had just put the request in today and had asked me to expedite it. He didn't even bother to include what was the request ID as I have limited view of the request system. I can't see any request unless it was placed in my bucket and being a hardware tech, it will never be in my bucket. Again, I replied to him reminding that it was not my area to handle software request. And again...he never responded.

Today...I get a email from him and it consists of long chains of emails from plant managers, supervisors, lab technicians with a panic tone regarding the auditor unable to complete their job because of said software issue. The manager had asked me to look into why the software was not working properly. Turns out that the manager had emailed another technician and that tech installed the software for them but didn't set it up correctly. I didn't respond to the email as I have repeatedly told the manager as well other plant employees of the correct process to request software as well requesting assistance (via help desk) and if they want to ignore that, then I will ignore them.

That's the problem with being a really good tech. If people realize that, they'll avoid the whole process of contacting help desk and dicking around with them and instead email me directly.",And that's my problem?,68
EKfkn4,41,40,1nrfwz,213,"Long time lurker, first time poster here so hopefully my story isn't too bland.

I'll start by saying that I have no formal computer training, just A LOT of hours logged tinkering and troubleshooting at home. This has kind of made me the ""go to"" guy for my family, friends, girlfriend and girlfriends family whenever a computer goes awry.

So, about 4 nights ago I get a call from a very flustered and frustrated girlfriend. She has just started her own small jewelry business and is trying be as professional as possible. This includes building a website (read: having me build said website), setting up a paypal account (again, passed off to me) and stocking up on receipts, labels and other stationery to make everything ""legit"". Her opening line reminds me of something out of a Clint Eastwood movie.

Me: Hello?

Her: (low whispering) I'm going to destroy this goddamned printer...

Me: Umm... what's going on?

Her: I ordered new ink cartridges for my printer but when I put them in, the printer doesn't recognize the black 
ink.

Me: Ok no need to panic, this shouldn't be too hard to figure out. Did y....

Her: I already pulled off the stupid safety sticker shit from the cartridge. Don't even ask about that!

Me: O_o alrighty, glad that's out of the way. Is the printer giving you an error message?

Her: Would I be calling you if it wasn't?!?!

Me: Ok... what does the message say?

Her: IT SAYS IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK!!!

At this point I'm trying to maintain some patience, knowing that this could be pretty frustrating for someone in the infantile stages of getting their business off the ground.

Me: Ok, just calm down. Can you take the black ink cartridge out of the printer, find the the part number on the cartridge and read it to me?

Her: FINE! It says #######.

Me: And what make and model printer do you have?

Her: It's an HP blah blah blah

Me: Alright hold on real quick... (onward to Google!)

After a quick Google search, I find that the part number on the cartridge is compatible with the printer, so that's not the issue.

Me: Ok so the cartridge matches up to the printer, that's out of the way. And you took off the safety sticker... hmm. Ok you're gonna have to try cleaning the contacts on the cartridge and the printer.

Her: What for?! It's a brand new fucking cartridge! I shouldn't have to clean anything!

Me: Yea but it's not a brand new printer, just trust me. Go get a cotton swab and a little rubbing alcohol.

At this point, I hear cabinets slamming, shit toppling over and a constant spew of obscenities from the other end. It sounds like the fuckin' Spanish Inquisition over there! She comes stomping back to the phone like an angry deceptacon. 

Her: Ok now what!

Me: Put a little alcohol on the cotton swab, find the copper colored ribbon in the printer and wipe it with the swab. Then, use the other end of the swab and do the same thing to the copper colored ribbon on the cartridge.

Her: I told you I took off the damn safety sticker from the cartridge!

Me: Uhh... I know. Now I'm telling you to clean the cartridge contact rib... OH ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?! Did you peel the fuckin ribbon off the cartridge?!!?

Her: Yea that stupid protective sticker shit! ARE YOU NOT LISTENING TO ME?!

Me: Good job, you just guaranteed that cartridge won't work. That wasn't the protective sticker, that was THE DAMN CONTACT TO MAKE IT WORK! Take the color ink cartridge out of your printer and tell me what's different between the two.

Dinodiva,14,12,1nqxpo,38,"Salutations to all!

I come before you today with another tale of basic incompetency at my humble high school. I am a freshman, and all of my friends know that I am the ""go-to"" person for ~~their I.D.10.T errors~~ tech problems.

This tale takes place during our lunch hour. We are hungrily stuffing our faces with the delicacy of school lunch food. I'm sitting next to a few friends, and one of them is hastily tapping away at their laptop, trying to finish some overlooked homework before the period ends. Suddenly, she expresses concern and turns the laptop in my direction. 

**Friend**: Dinodiva, my laptop will not display the brightness indicator when I use the function keys to adjust it. Will you take a look at it?

Impressed with the detail of her description, I comply and take a look. I try adjusting the brightness for myself by holding the Fn and corresponding function keys. No slider appears on the screen. Sliders for volume and every other function work, except for brightness. She tells me that it was working yesterday, and now it suddenly wasn't today. My time is limited and I can't do any in-depth troubleshooting or questioning, so I take it to Google.

This laptop is a standard [Lenovo ThinkPad X131E](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834312169) to all freshman students. I briskly search ""lenovo brightness indicator not working"". Immediately I find it - this is caused by the absence of the Lenovo Energy Management application. I search her computer for the application and the results are empty. Perplexed, I wonder why this was working yesterday but not today. A plausible scenario was that she deleted it without knowing, but regardless, I found the issue.

I turn the laptop towards her and explain that she needs to install this application to restore the brightness indicator. I am unable to, since downloading **anything** requires an administrative username and password to proceed; all of our accounts are controlled by the school. 

She nods, thanks me, and then says, ""You're SO SMART! The tech department should hire you... OR MAYBE GEEK SQUAD! YEAH! Everyone should come to you for tech problems! Just ignore the teachers and come straight to you! You're awesome!""

I smile at her enthusiasm and said I was happy I was able to help. I told her to take her machine down to the tech department afterwards so they could proceed with the installation of the application.

Zvanbez,30,15,1nqws4,70,"I'm not a tech guy, rather I'm a grad student who had to watch a train wreck of an encounter between an professor who didn't know how to troubleshoot a video issue and our IT support tech.

Our professor is pretty tech illiterate. His laptop is a cluster of tiny icons linking to all of the documents he uses to teach...but that's beside the point. Anyway, yesterday, he comes in and hooks up to the projector. Literally does the same thing he normally does: walks in with his computer on and connects to the projector that's still on from the previous lecture/meeting and voila: powerpoint!

However, it wouldn't work. He tried unplugging it a few times but couldn't get it to work. He then asked if anyone knew how to fix it because he didn't want to trouble the IT people unless we couldn't fix it. I volunteered to check and make sure he had the right video settings. Still unable to fix it, he went and had the IT guy dispatched.

In walks the IT guy (around 10 minutes into class).
IT: Did you walk in with your computer powered on or did you connect the projector cable and then power it the computer on?

Prof: My computer was already on. That's the way that I always...

IT: (interrupting) Well you should know better than that. You're doing it wrong.

Prof: But it's never been a problem before.

IT: Well you see in order to work the computer has to detect the signals from the projector on power up. You can't just plug something in when your computer is powered on and expect it to work. You computer can only hold a certain amount of information about projectors and eventually it just can't remember new things (WHAT?). I will see if there is anything else I can do but you're going to need to power down your computer and then restart it.

Professor looks visibly defeated and continues with his lecture while IT guy restarts (and in the process loses a grant application the professor had in Word).

Now, based on the way the IT guy had said it, we expected to be up and running in a few minutes. However, 40 minutes later the IT guy was still working because the professor ""had messed up a setting on his computer and he was going to need to fix it"".

Finally the IT guy decides to check the projector. Turns out that the projector was on input C instead of input B. No one had thought to check this because the professor literally just walks in and connects the computer every lecture.

IT: Well it looks like your problem was that you had it set to the wrong input. You should have been able to fix this yourself. I shouldn't have to check that when I get called.
Professor: ....
IT guy (leaves)

Given, the professor or I should have checked the input when we looked at it, but I had never actually seen a projector with multiple VGA input channels like that. Professor honestly didn't know enough about that to do it.

Regardless...please don't be this guy. And, if you still feel the need to give someone criticism, at least don't do it in front of a lecture room full of students.

KansasWizard,43,47,1nqwj3,168,"Fortunately it's a slow afternoon here, so I'll post some more for your amusement and horror.  

Let's see there was a request for Non-profit Nonsense, so I'll start there.  

*/begin walltext/*

The agency runs a school program, food program, does over 400 lunches a day for the local community , has a clothing bank, career wear bank, and emergency aid services. So yes, they are good for the community, and do good things. That's not the issue. 

What they did not have, and not have it in abundance, was Technical Common Sense. 

So how did I get into their situation? Well, my SO started working there, and then grew tired of the issues with her PC and having to fix the PCs of others when she was told repeatedly that was not her job. ( which it wasn't but they were an especially special group of users. ) There was a ""tech"" at the time, husband to the CFO, but he was self taught and had health issues. So my services were offered on a volunteer basis, but the tech never had time to meet with me to let me help him. 

In fact, a few weeks later, the CFO retired and the tech decided he was done and took a scorched earth policy to certain sections of the server. His notes, user account, email account, and lots of important data was lost in the ensuing deletion spree. 

I was asked to see if I could fix or change the system. Fortunately, there was still an old admin account active. That gave me access to the servers, email, active directory, but not the biometric security system. (More on that later) 

But wait! Surely there must be backups! To the ~~Server Room!~~ ... er ... ~~Server Closet!~~ ... er ... Wiring Closet with delusions of grandeur? Yes, lets go with that. 

We'll get back to the actual contents of the ""server room"" later. 

Log into Server 2003 box, check for backup software..nope.
Check Windows backup... backups have not run successfully in ****two years****.

Roll for Sanity Check... Failed. 

The server ran AD, exchange, hosted the website and held all the financial data, as well as the data points that were used to write grants and requests for funds. 

Backups started that night, to a location offsite. 



Quick Note about the old backup location, listed as a local drive... turned out it was supposed to be a mirrored set of 750 GB USB drives sitting physically on the server tower. They were not mirrored, and the data was corrupt anyway from the failed backups. Not sure how that was supposed to be a  Disaster Recovery option...

Her: I just had to pay my employees, but they haven't worked all week because YOU didn't fix our problems.

    Intro
	
Sorry this is so long, it's actually a bit longer than need be I think. This one is more of an entertaining (to me) rant on my newest client. Hope it's amusing enough for you guys. I got a call from the adult daughter of an old client of mine. She has the following issues:

- Popups for dial-up internet (they're on cable).
- Running really slow.
- Double spacing in Word.
- Internet randomly cuts out or slows down.
- Programs keep telling her to backup/download X software.

Now, the thing is, this lady reads everything to me. EVERYTHING. As in: 

&gt;""It says 'WARNING: Your... computer may be... (yeah, ok-) infected... (I know, ma'am-) please connect to... (I get it-) our website at... www.StealMySocial.com... Is that bad?"" 

So the above symptoms took an hour and a half to describe. She was particularly peeved about the Word double spacing issue, which she went on about at length.

Turns out, she thought her PC was slow so she somehow came across Shady Indian Tech Support, Inc. and decided to allow them to remote into her PC (!!!). She found them, they didn't find her. That's my first warning sign that not all is well in the land of Oz. My second was when I asked ""Ok, how much did you pay them?"" to which she responds with ""Oh, nothing, they did it for free."" 

Like hell they did...

I still don't know what they took as compensation, but I ended up going over there to check it out. Now, this is my first experience with Windows 8, and it left me less than amused. I started solving her woes by simply going into Programs and Features and uninstalling the bloatware and some of the easier to remove stuff. Then I decide to go into Safe Mode to run some malware removal tools and the likes.

Only there is no Safe Mode option.

    The Rant

~~I'm used to my Windows allowing me to choose safe mood on a reboot. Windows 8 does away with such archaic contraptions as this in favour of a more... *streamlined* approach. Here is how the Windows 8 do:~~

**Edit:** I'm being informed I'm a moron, but the below is the only documented method of entering safe mode I had seen. This is my side job so I don't usually have to use safe mode. Sorry for my ignorance.

1) Hover the mouse in the top right corner of the desktop (no indication this is a context sensitive area).

2) In this new Charms menu, click Settings.

3) In Settings, click the power icon.

4) *While holding shift* (again, no indication for this), click Restart.

5) In the pre-shutdown menu you now have, click Troubleshoot.

6) In Troubleshoot's menu, click Advanced Options

7) In Advanced Options, click Startup Settings.

8) In Startup Settings, click Restart.

9) When Windows 8 finishes restarting, press the '4' key on the keyboard to enter safe mode.

See, guys? We've been wasting *so much effort* with our previous, overly complicated methods of booting into safe mode. 

Anyway, after that happy fun time experience, I proceed to run Malwarebytes, CCleaner, and RevoUninstaller to get at a program that wouldn't reveal itself through any natural or mystical means I had at my disposal. Revo found it, Revo killed it so props to that lifesaver of a program.

Once I was done, 54 infections were found and I uinstalled probably around 10 pieces of bloatware and another 15 pieces of adware and 6 toolbars across two browsers. How long has she had this PC? About a week.

    Epilogue
	
So I got a call last night and was informed she now somehow FUBARed her network adapters or some such. After walking her through some attempted troubleshooting I decided I'd rather go over and fix it myself, so I'm heading there Sunday. With any luck, she'll generate a few stories for this sub that I can share, hopefully more interesting than this one. I'll let you know if she does.

SnowDogger,45,52,1nqnbt,281,"I work for a large US university as a web developer. Occasionally I am asked to dabble in server support and from this my tale commences...

A certain department on campus that I occasionally work with had hired a web developer who was, shall we say, ""overly cautious"" about security. Every web app he wrote he created multiple custom user logs, error logs, activity logs, etc. You click a link in one of his apps, you get logged. He set it up so the log files are text files stored on the server -- remember this, it will become important shortly. Every web page is encrypted before being moved to production and decrypted on the fly as it's served. I think overkill, but whatever -- not really my department and I only know this because I'm friends with this guy's supervisor. His web pages were pretty cool from an end-user's perspective, fwiw.

He was finally fired for many reasons, one of them being that he wouldn't give the decryption password to his supervisor who had been asking for it for over a year. The morning after he's fired -- the actual freaking *morning after* -- I get a call from his supervisor telling me that particular server seems down, no web pages load, the ones that do error out, etc. I can still remote in so I take a look -- of course I can't see much because, duh, all source code is encrypted and we don't have the password. I take a look at the database and what do you know -- all rows in all tables have been deleted. Whiskey. Tango. Foxtrot. Dynamic web pages crash to a halt. Server's been hacked, right? 

I call up my database guru, he restores the nightly backup and we're mostly back in business. First crisis averted. I'm poking around on the server doing my best data forensics impersonation and discover all the log files and they are HUGE, we're talking hundreds and hundreds of mb. WTF x2. I take a look at the last 24 hours and guess who shows up as logging in and poking around right before the crash -- yep, Mr. Security. I inform my supervisor, his supervisor, and Human Resources that I have a smoking gun pointing at Mr. Security and how the hell do they want to handle it. 

At this point all the action is happening between supervisors and HR, I'm out of the loop. All I found out was that HR did not press any charges and somehow they managed to get the unencrypted source code from him (which I implemented back on to the server -- potential crisis #2 averted).

Coda: A year or two goes by when someone in another department tells me Mr. Security has applied for another tech job here at the university and *listed me as a reference*!!! WTF x3.

angelothewizard,51,41,1nqdld,195,"Greetings, my much better at tech support fellows! I am but a lowly Computer Lab Assistant at my local college-pays the bills while I go to school. The primary aspect of my job is helping students use the computers at the lab I am assigned. This isn't too bad, the students that come to my lab (upstairs Library) tend to be smart enough to know how to print, go into school websites, and all the other things we need to do. 

The second part of my job is fixing the printers when they break. Now, this is actually not as bad as you might think-Our Laserjet is fairly reliable, only flipping its shit when it's out of paper, or something done jammed. The Xerox is a bit more annoying, but still workable.

So yesterday, I'm sitting at my desk, playing some Advance Wars to pass the time, when a student comes up to the Laserjet, wanting to retrieve a print job. Problem was, the Laserjet wasn't printing and was flashing a red light. So I start poking around, thinking it's a standard jam-the paper didn't get fed in properly or some other easy fix.

Well, turns out that wasn't the case. And here's where the printer was actually nice to me for a change: I scrolled through the printer's on screen instructions, and the printer advised me to open the top of the printer. I grab it and lift up-I didn't even know I could do that! I then removed the ink cartridge (getting ink all over my hands and necessitating a trip to the bathroom) and I find the jam.

Somehow, a piece of paper had managed to fold itself into a perfect trifold while going through the printer. I yank the paper out, put everything back, and the printer immediately kicks back on.

I am sure everyone here has dealt with conspiracy theorists.  I know that some of you have probably even talked with schizophrenics or even paranoid schizophrenics.  This is a tale of several calls logged over a 2 month period that our 4 man IT/support dept. had to deal with.

*****
Call 1:  Gentleman calls in.  I get the call.   He is an older gentleman and is pretty cordial.  Had some issues with his service and basic troubleshooting had it fixed in about 10 minutes (takes a while to walk him through the fix, but it gets done).  Was just some noise-on-the-line issues.  During this time, he starts saying things like ""The noise on phone lines isn't interference.  It is the NSA spying on you.  The more noise you have, the closer they are to discovering your secret!""
*****
Call 2:  I once again get the call.  It has been a couple of weeks, and again, noise issues on the line.  This time, the gentleman starts telling me wild tales of his days as a member of the MIB.  He regales me with tales of seeing women stick their fingers through solid chunks of titanium after training in alien martial-arts.  He tells me that pop-cans are really a sign that we are under the control of the Venusians as they did not exist until our Govt. signed a contract with Venus to make Coca Cola.  He tells me that tin-foil hats do not work, that only nickel-plated lead will keep mind readers out of your mind.
*****
Call 3:  Fellow tech takes this one.  I see him get a more and more puzzled look on his face during the call.  After he hangs up, he tells me ""I didn't believe you about that gentleman, dude.  But he is real.  He just told me that Aunt Jemima was a psychic who controlled people through narcotics inserted in her Syrup.""
*****
Call 4:  Different tech takes this one.  He puts it on speakerphone for us to hear.  We hear the man ranting about the FBI and CIA and NSA  tapping his phone lines and internet communications and wants to know if we wrapped all our networking equipment in nickel-plated, lead lined Faraday Cages that so that they could not watch him as he did his covert work to expose the world govt. as a puppet controlled by the Bilderbergs.
*****
Call 5:  This is the last call, and was taken by our manager.  I hear him say something offhand about satellites and then hear him rattle off a phone number to the person on the other line.  After the call, my manager looks at me, and tells me: ""I think I solved our problem.  That weird old man called in and asked for the number to the 'Satellite People' because he had the 'Real' Sputnik in his house and it wasn't Russian, it was from Africa and the Lizard People.  He wouldn't get off the phone until I gave him a number for the 'Satellite People', so I gave him the number for NASA.""

valarauca,119,83,1npx99,346,"So my one co-worker has been complaining about his computer running slow.

Over our summer business slow season I took a look at it. It was running low on hard drive space, but was very tight on RAM. we upgraded the RAM to 32bit's max (aka the max 32bit address will hold, 4gigabyte srsly people?), and decided that it would be fine for another few years in production.

This week he came back and said he ran out of hard drive space and no applications would start. I thought this was odd since the old windowsXp box is basically just used to look up files on our companies servers. But undaunted and all my projects being done I decided to give it a look and waste some time.

I instantly jumped to the hard disk which faithfully reported 1.7MB free out of 74.4GB. Oh wow he wasn't joking, he really is flat out of space. Then I went to remove applications thinking I could remove some circa. 2006 bloatware, but it was clean (as I already worked on this computer). 

Running out of ideas I decided that I could just start CCleaner and go back to work on my proper softwar eningeering life. This was at 9am on thursday. I started Ccleaner and shut off the monitor and went back to my normal day to day.

AND IT BEGINS.

Come lunch time I flick the monitor back on, the computer faithfully starts back up and 0% progress. It's still deleteing temporary internet files. But its only gotten so far as around the files that start with ""F"". So I pull up the ol' ""My Computer"" which reports 2.3GB of free space on the hard drive.

I show the screen to my co-worker and we have a good laugh. I flick the monitor back off and go back to work. Come around quitting time, I flick the monitor back on, we got to the letter ""S"", and are nearly at 4 GB of space freed up.

At this point I'm amazed this computer managed to keep functioning for so long. I flick off the monitor and head home to return home to drink some beer, play league of legend, and browse /g.

Returning to work in the morning, I see 26.2GB free, and Ccleaner crashed. For fuck sakes. I restart it and it pauses around ""G"".

Wish me luck guys.

MrTwinkeh,65,181,1nps7m,664,"**Background:**

I was having a bad day. Like, called in early, made to work overtime, constantly bad users and mind-wrenching tickets. This was near the end of the day, so about 6 or 7pm.

**People:**

M : Me
U : User


**Story:**

I was at work, feeling slightly frustrated with all the people who come in, when one person walks in with a completely *destroyed* acer. This machine had seen the nether regions of hell. He plonks it on the table, and looks up at me.

U: It won't turn on.

As I am feeling frustrated, and as it seems quite obvious why it does not turn on, I play along.

M: Hmm... I can't quite see the problem, let's try to boot it up.

I then proceed to wrench open the warped screen, and I press the on button. Nothing.

M: Well.

I sigh.

M: It won't turn on.

He looks at me oddly.

U: Yeah, I just told you that! Fix it!

M: I am just not sure what the problem is. Let me open the back up and see.

I open up the back and lift off the bent plastic. Inside, one of the RAM modules is snapped clean in half, and there are other bits and bobs are strewn everywhere.

M: Ah!

I pick up a small shrapnel of plastic, and I look closely at it.

M: That's your problem. This is called a starter-upperer. It starts the computer.

I am trying to keep a straight face. He is nodding in understanding.

M: These aren't cheap. It would cost BIG money.

He looks shocked and anxious.

M: But... I am lenient, I will give you a spare.

He looks relieved and lets out a breath. I give him a spare and he waddles out. I didn't even ask how he did it.

I also do all of the coordination with the actual IT people, so that (among other reasons) there's always someone in the building who knows what the hell is going on.

Our web designer did more of this before I got there, and still does a little, so he came up to me the other day and said, ""[Student worker] was wondering if you swapped out her computer.""

Me: ""Uh... I haven't moved anything for a couple of days, and definitely nothing in her cube.""

Him: ""She's saying that she went to use it and nothing she had on the desktop is there anymore, and she and [her supervisor] can't figure it out.""

Me: [pause for thought] ""I put a work-study student there Friday. Ask her to log out and come find me if she can't find it when she logs back in.""

Nothing back. Two hours later I pass him in the hall and he says, ""You were right. I can't believe it didn't occur to me, it just seems too dumb to be true.""

brerrabbitt,21,17,1nogkj,101,"Twas a dark and stormy night and I was babysitting an industrial park with a few coworkers as we started the night shift over a pot of coffee.

We get a frantic call to one of the special buildings that does some processes that are so dangerous that it's out in the middle of a big empty field and is remotely operated from a concrete and earth bunker a few hundred yards away. 

It's the offgoing tech and he's telling us that the building took a direct lightning strike and nothing is working.

Perfect.

My and my buddies drive out to the building to surveil the damage. As soon as we park, the off going tech does a panicked hi and bye and runs for the shop to park his truck. He was in over his head and wanted no part of this.

Thankfully he had reset some of the sprinkler systems for us which was a real pain in the ass requiring a lot of bravery, balance, and a tall ladder. The real pain in the ass started when we began checking out computers and the programmable logic controllers. 

I'm not saying that everything was old, but the computers were still using DOS and the PLCs were still using contact type relays instead of solid state relays.

Half the analog inputs were gone. A process controller in the control room had caught on fire and it just got worse from there. 

You see, the building was still in the middle of a hazardous process and the batch was still viable and far too expensive to dump at that point. Think a few hundred thousand dollars and we had to get it heating up and mixing pretty quick if we were going to save it.

We check out the analog racks in back and they are still working according to the PLC, so we look at the DC power supply that provided the 24VDC to make all the 4-20ma transmitters work. It was blown. One of my buddies runs to the shop to get a replacement while we continue troubleshooting.

The hydraulics are out. As we are troubleshooting that, my other buddy finds out the hard way that the lightning strike had not only destroyed the contactor, but it had fused one leg of the breaker closed. We call our buddy driving towards the shop on the radio and tell him to get us a new breaker and contactor as well.

It takes us about an hour to make repairs but one temperature transmitter is still not working. Screw it. One of the more disposable production line people can manually take temperatures just to get everything back up to temperature. We'll just operate the steam by valves from the back of the building.

We get the batch heating again and continue repairs. Out of six frequency drives, we find that five of them are blown. Another road trip ensues but we only have one replacement at the shop in the right size. 

Not a problem. We have a whole industrial park to steal parts from and the bosses are home asleep. Gotta love the shady dealings that happen on the night shift.

Five frequency drives of assorted makes and models later and a small pile of tech manuals at our feet, we have installed, swagged the configurations, tested, and can now remotely operate all the motors that add ingredients.

Most of the shift is over at this point, but we are still working. The analog transmitter for temperature is blown but we wire up directly to the thermocouple, change the wiring a bit, look up the voltage response for that type of thermocouple and do a bit of strange math on paper to figure out what the settings on the new process controller should be. We ramp the temperature up to the high end and low end of the spec and we manage to stay within a degree of what the production line worker is getting with his digital thermometer.

Thank you, Mr. V. Fifteen years after your calculus class and I still remembered what you taught us.

Dawn is peeking at us over the horizon as we start packing up our tools to go home. The day shift arrives at the same point in the process as when they had left, but at least now, everything works.

Or not.

We have a nastygram yellow memo on our desk when we show up the next night. Apparently our day counterpart had to go into the back of the building and adjust the startup torque on one of the frequency drives. Apparently it needs a bit more power when that particular ingredient is cold.

The three of us read the note, look to each other, and start discussing ways of getting rid of the other tech. Considering some of the systems we had access to, they would never find the body.

We calmed down and just did a writeup of the night before so our boss could tell his boss why the building was down that shift and left him a parts list of what we had taken from stock and had comshawed from other buildings.

Twas a good morning to get drunk.

I mostly do purchase consultations for departmental computers at my University, having moved up from the help desk. I review department's proposed computer purchases and confirm or veto them depending on several factors including price, vendor, and technical need. Orders must go through me before our Purchasing department will process any orders for computer/tablet/printers.

Recently, I received a ticket with a summary line that read something like this: ""Very urgent - we need a purchase consultation for an iPad immediately."" The body of the ticket was more of the same: ""ZOMG we need it yesterday"" - ""Super time critical"" - etc....

I contact the user to find out details of this mysterious, yet super critical, need to purchase a single iPad.

Basically, it boiled down to this: There had been a contest at a sporting event 2 weeks prior where a student won an iPad.... that the department did not have. Finally, 2 weeks later, someone finally decides they need to see about buying one to give the hapless student.

*facepalming* I informed the department that since it is a giveaway and not being tagged as university property, she would need to contact the main Controller's office to fill out a myriad of special paperwork and that I would not be involved in the purchase.

She was amicable, but I can't help but feel sorry for the poor student who won't be seeing their iPad for another 2 weeks or more. :-\",ZOMG THIS IS SUPER URGENT AND TIME SENSITIVE....,189

I now have 3 techs working for me (not to mention some sales/account people) and I hardly go out to see clients other than to make the sale.  I enjoy it because I don't deal with the stupid questions any more.


There has been a rash of sickness go through my company and 2 of my techs are sick this week.  So I had to strap on my tech hat and get out there again.

He had signed up for service the day before (while sober), and that day, was wanting me to walk him through the setup.  After 45 minutes of trying to be patient, it quickly became apparent he was too drunk to even type in his name into the username box.

Why was she demoted instead of straight up fired?  Because despite being absolutely batshit intolerably insane, the president of the company thinks she can do no wrong.  We'll call her TC.  I bet you know what that stands for.

TC can't figure out how to use basic programs.  I show her how to do simple things over and over because I know that if I don't, she will flip her shit and go over my head.  This morning I was in the middle of a high priority project.  Everything's going swimmingly until this happens.

TC: I can't figure out this simple Word problem

Me: I actually don't have time to help you with this right now, I'm working on a high priority project.

My boss comes to my desk *an hour* later.  TC has been bitching about me for an hour at my boss.  Apparently I was insubordinate, rude, and nasty with her.  Naturally, my boss didn't believe that for a second.  I go above and beyond for my users.  I work on weekends without complaint and I take pride in my professional and pleasant demeanor in the workplace.  I'm also Canadian, in case you couldn't tell. :P

My boss took it up the chain in case TC decided to go above my boss' head.  So now this crazy lady has wasted my time, my boss' time, and my boss' boss' time.  Our COO said he couldn't ever picture me being rude to a coworker and that I wouldn't have said no or later if it wasn't important.

I'm still annoyed the whole thing happened.  I try to always leave a positive impression, especially when the COO is involved.  Now his time is wasted because of something that involves me despite the fact that it wasn't my fault.

I guess there are pros and cons to the whole situation.  On the one hand, my flexibility (I am admittedly a bit *too* flexible a lot of the time, especially with problem users) and patience have paid off.  I know that I have a solid reputation for getting things done and being professional.  On the other hand, TC still has a job despite years of crazy nonsense and will likely continue to spew random nonsense for years to come.  The official word from my boss is more or less placate her because we can't get rid of her.

**TLDR:** Nasty coworker hears the dreaded NO word and tries to go above my head.  Is shot down.

**Edit:** There has been a request for stories of crazy.  Where do I start?  Here are a few fun ones.

* A quarter of her staff quit within two months because they couldn't work with her any more.  Over the course of her employment here, at least half of her all time staff have quit due to her insanity.  About a quarter of her all time employees had been fired before they could quit.  While she was allowed to manage people, it was a safe assumption that if her door was closed someone would come out of it crying.  It was closed for at least an hour every day.  She is no longer allowed to directly manage any workers.

* She made a girl cry on Christmas Eve before 8AM because of a typo on an email that hadn't been sent out yet.

* She is responsible for the nervous breakdowns of two administrative assistants.  One is still unemployed after years.  The other quit to do catering despite her double major in business and accounting.  Oh!  And one of our ex IT managers writes childrens novels instead of programming now.

* One of her favorite tricks is to lie and say that someone higher up doesn't like what someone is doing.  For example, I had a new girl come up to me looking worried.  She said ""TC told me that CEO doesn't like seeing me in the kitchen so much.  I don't know what to do!""  TC does this *all the time*.

* I show her how to open her secure mail from one client each and every morning.  It has been two months.

* If and when at any point someone tells her no or maybe she goes immediately above their head.  It's like clockwork.  She doesn't talk about the actual problem but instead makes up wild stories about supposed insults and rudeness.

**Edit 2:** So our admin assistant just called me for help on something.  She's vague but she'll show me if I come to her desk.  Guess what it is?  That's right, the same word document that caused the kerfluffle.  I helped her out because A-I have time now and B-she actually understood what I showed her and seemed to retain the information.

A few months ago however, that changed.

It was the usual story.  The user thought that the Recycle Bin was the perfect place to store her files while she was moving from one desk to another. Then someone came along and emptied it and she lost all her files and needed them recovered.

Plot Twist! The files were hard copy!

She actually put her paper files into a cardboard box near her desk and failed to notice the box was labelled Recycle Bin.  Then the cleaners came overnight and emptied it.

Cue major panic from the user next morning.  Luckily her files were found in the backup storage unit (the big bins in the basement) and restored with minimal packet loss.

GeneralDisorder,7,11,1nnbxa,48,"I have a specific coworker who if reading this knows exactly who they are who took a call regarding some blah BS that's coming up shortly. This particular tech is really good at what we do (works a small team where security issue and legal issues get escalated and has vast knowledge of the web hosting industry as many of us do).

I happen to specialize in a department that's very small and absurdly specialized and so this is where I come into the story. The initial call went approximately like this:

**LT** (this stands for Loud Tech...): Hello &lt;blah&gt;

**RC** (registrant caller): Hi I want to change my blue record for ns1.notfuckingregisteredwithyou.net

**LT**: Hold just one moment. 

**LT** to the room-- ""What is a blue record? Something about name servers? I'm not sure what he's asking."" 

**PAUSE:** The caller said [""glue record""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Circular_dependencies_and_glue_records). Closest ~~analogy~~ explanation is ""A DNS record that tells the world 'this domain serves DNS and the name server lives at the following IP address'"". We do this. We do this for any domain registered through us. And of course most other registrars also offer this service. The record they want to change is registered with ""Otherstrar, INC"" which is a fictional name which I'll use for any registrar that I don't work for.

**LT** to the room: Oh... Glue record. Ok. Got it.

**LT**: I'm sorry about the hold. It looks like notfuckingregisteredwithyou.net is registered with Otherstrar, INC. To change the glue record you have to contact them.

**RC**: blah! 

(I don't know what his response was to this. I wasn't there. I was on another call at this time.)

**LT**: No, this is not something we can change here, contact Otherstrar, INC.

**RC**: Let me talk to someone who knows what the fuck they're talking about!

**LT**: Ok, that's not happening. I'm going to end this call. &lt;click&gt;


So, there you have it. Customer calls the wrong place wanting to change something and doesn't believe our tech. I have a theory why but I've said too much already. Of course, he doesn't like this correct and completely true answer so he calls back and demands a manager. This issue has already been well-broadcast by LT (who is loud and is ~~aware of it~~ unashamed). A manager (somewhat) has already been made aware of the call and that this guy will 99% likely call back. 

The tech sitting behind me who we can just call N4 for ""Noob, number 4"" gets this call and is yelled at to get a supervisor because blah, blah. Yes. RC is angry that he got the correct answer and didn't believe it. So, our nearest MOD says to N4 ""yeah, I'll take that call. Send him over. My EXT is ####""

**MOD**: Hello, this is MOD.

**RC**: rabble rabble rabble

**PAUSE**: It doesn't matter what was discussed at this point. But the story was somehow incompatible with the first version of the story and MOD is repeating back the majority of what's been said (he's not on speaker... that would be disruptive). FWIW, I'm listening and at some point this user claims to have changed something. I happen to have full access to all the records of everything this guy has ever done in his account and his claim goes that he did something today. But the only record I have is that he logged in. He hasn't changed anything.

**MOD**: Ok. Let me do a quick search because this is a little outside my realm of familiarity.

So, MOD puts RC on hold and is asking LT ""What did he ask for? It doesn't seem to agree with what he asked you?"" Of course LT is agitated by this as is often the case when someone calls in, asks a question then insults your intelligence for giving the correct answer. I had been listening in and trying to help them out from the start as I am the go-to registrar guy in that particular room. So I ask MOD if he wants to send the caller to me. He says ""yeah, that's probably best.""

**MOD**: Sorry about the hold here. I just talked with out ThisSTRAR, INC specialist and he wasn't quite sure what your end goal was. If you don't mind I'd like to transfer your call over to him. His name is General.

**GD** (for God-Damnit, I'm late... That's me in case you're confused.): Hello ThisSTRAR Support, this is General.

**RC**: Hi, have you been briefed on the call so far?

**GD**: Yes. I'm aware of both calls you had. I actually seem to have gotten two different requests. One was about changing the glue record for ns1.notfuckingregisteredwithyou.net and something about changing the whois for isfuckingregisteredwithyou.biz. So, what exactly are we trying to accomplish here?

**RC**: Ok. I want to change the IP address ns1.notfuckingregisteredwithyou.net. So I go into your backend and I called in and got this moron who said you guys...

**GD**: Let me stop you there for a second. So you want to change the IP of ns1.notfuckingregisteredwithyou.net?

**RC**: That's correct.

**GD**: Ok. And notfuckingregisteredwithyou.net is registered with Otherstrar, INC, correct?

**RC**: Yes.

**GD**: Right. So to change this glue record you need to go where the glue record was created. You need to change this at Otherstrar, INC.

**RC**: AH. I got ya. Ok, I see what I did wrong now. Thank you. 

You could tell he was a little embarrassed. Total time on my phone... 1 minute, thirty some seconds (want to say 1:37 but that'd be way too true and would have to instead get posted at /r/thathappened). He was clearly embarrassed when he figured out the initial confusion and realized he literally was just given the right answer immediately before starting this ridiculous argument.

Evenstar22,23,12,1nn8os,38,"Hey TFTS, those of you who know me know I am a moderately talented user, with a lot of knowledge about computers, but sometimes not the practical application of that knowledge. That's ok, google will tell me :D

Cue to a couple of days back, I get a skype message from my mother in law, who I really do love. I love her to pieces, and she's a shitload more fun than my family. But, and it's a big but, ALL the computer related talent in the family went to my husband. She will listen to any instructions you give her, and sometimes she will remember them too!

But she also has a talent for misapplication of those instructions, unlike any other user I have ever seen. Sometimes it seems she knows just enough to get her in to trouble.




So, two days ago I get a message from her quite late at night her time (we are currently situated on different continents), telling me that her office suite has stopped working on both computers. No biggie, I get her to give me her teamviewer pass, and put an activation key in. Damn, it didn't work, why not??.... She's running professional 2010, and it turns out I need a Mak key, or bulk license. No biggie, I sift through my pile of keys and find one.... problem almost solved.

And: you have lost connection. Sigh. MIL has gone to bed, so I can't get her to help me log back in. I send her a message, asking her to contact me the next day when she gets back on her computer, as it was a simple activation key fix. I shouldn't have said it was simple. Big Mistake.



The next day she comes online briefly, but doesn't message. I assume this is because she is busy with something (not an uncommon ocurrance) and doesn't need her comp today. 

The next day, she comes online and messages me. Good, I think, let's get to the meat of this.
She asks me if I will remotely maintain her computers, and give it a look over once or twice a month... 
I am somewhat suspicious at this statement, but agree and relay it to my husband:



Your mother is asking me to help her maintain her computers on a regular basis, and to do a bi-monthly cleanse. When she says things like bi-monthly cleanse, I am concerned as to what THE USER is actually doing to her machines....
[09:12:15] DH: thats
[09:12:23] DH: like asking her to come clean your house
[09:12:33] DH: but its a good idea





So, I remote in and....she says she needs to tell me something. Oh Oh. This can't be good. And I get this



*When I picked up the Microsoft 2013 pack from office works I had initially forgotton I had it and finally remembered you may recall when we tried to get together on team viewer.* 

*I dont know how we lost contact by the way. However, after we lost contact I was battling again with the computer until I called Microsoft and got through to V on Wednesday at around 1.00 pm.  Let me know if you would like to have some of his notes. By the way he asked me to insert a flash drive into the Dell after getting info from the HP.*

 *I still have the drive so let me know if you want to view it to see if there are any details you could use. However, after 6 hours of his attention he was not able to put the 2013 microsoft program into the HP and he has put Microsoft 2003 on the Dell. This leaves me confused. However, they want me to pay for support for a 3 year period which the price is $500.00. what do you think about that?*

*Personally I believe I was given the wrong impression by the customer service person P whom I spoke to initially before the technician V, P said that the price for technical support would be very minimal. Please comment you views, DIL. (by the way I have not yet paid).*



**Oh no.** Microsoft is asking her for 500 bucks. This sounds oddly fishy. I asked her to give me a URL for the company she called. It isn't microsoft.

They're a tech support company in Australia whose name reminds me of US transport security administration, though quite cleverly their website url adapts depending on what you google search for, so it seems not dis-similar from the microsoft site.

I am still a bit stumped as to why she went for external support and didn't call microsoft. Because she thought they were Microsoft.

She doesn't have the entirety of the support log, but she does have some of it.



The log reveals that they tried to bill her card... after not having specified how much for. They would link her to the pricing page, which gave a price range. They were demonstrating that her computer had infections (ERMAGERD INFECTIONS) by running cmd, ipconfig..... what were they doing, telling her her IPV6 address was a virus?

Oh, and they have so little faith in their log me in they linked my MIL to teamviewer.



**At this point, I am seriously pissed off.**
I mean, I've seen shady business practices, but this takes the cake in terms of what I have seen lately, and I live in Africa, where people paste images into word, ""don't really like MS paint"", and have NO idea what snip is. They also enter random monitor resolutions just for kicks.





So, I enter their live chat function on their site (not paying to call if I don't have to) and ask to speak to V. She tells me to call. I explain I am halfway across the world, and can she transfer me please?

She says she will remote me in, and to click a support link. I do, and she tells me to enter a code and click download.

EXCUSE ME.... it's good business practice to inform a consumer what they are downloading onto their personal system before just saying click download. You should probably tell them what it does too. What's your support address?

She doesn't respond to the first half, and gives me the address will quickly logging off.

Below is my email to them:





Hi Team,
I am contacting you to discuss your handling of some remote support service you completed for MIL.

Firstly, I contacted your team myself and I cannot believe you instruct your customers to enter the code and click download, without any explanation of what they are downloading, just statements like “I am going to connect you remotely”.
Then it leaves a customized version of log me in on their computer after you are done. The first rule of good tech support is that it works better than when you got it in the first place, and that you do not leave anything behind that wasn’t there before.

Second, you did not fix the issues with her office installation, but rather decided to install different versions parallel to what was there in the first place, taking up a limited amount of harddrive space, and rather than using her version of office 2013 on both computers, you decided to arbitrarily install office 2003 on one of them.

Then, when it came to payment, MIL does not have a specific price from you, just a link to your pricing page, and several attempts by you to get her to pay for 3 years of support, and attempts to support your case by opening cmd and showing her how many infections her computer must have, and telling her office suites require loads of support. For one, they don’t. They might occasionally require an activation key, but they do not require support. And trying to convince someone that cmd demonstrates viruses is just completely ridiculous. 

In my log I have a statement from A, that he wants to try BPay from another computer, or netbanking, and that her card didn’t go through. Tell me, if you ran her card, how much exactly did you try to bill her card for?

So, let me recap: You would not give her a one time price, you tried to show her evidence of infections through cmd (what were you doing, pointing at her IPV6 address and telling her it was a Trojan?), trying to sell her on three year support, while just linking to the pricing page when asked for a bill amount, you did not issue and invoice, and you used cracked keys to run her store bought version of 2013 (which has it’s own official key) parallel to her 2010, and installing 2003 on the other. 

You then tried to bill her, while on the remote session, for an unspecified amount.

None of this is appropriate, or good, technical support. Instead you have left me with laggy messes to clean up because you felt taking up more harddisk space by running two versions of the same program was a good idea. MIL is now not sure what needs to be fixed, but knows that things do not work correctly now. And the sheer gall of not explaining what it is your customers are downloading before they have done so is morally reprehensible. I’ll be interested to see if I can even pull an events log from it.

So, this is your opportunity: how are you going to fix this? And do not, do not remote in to either computers without first explaining to me what you are going to do about these issues, and what your bill would have been had you actually given it.

Last, don’t waste your time trying to explain to me how pointing out non-existent infections in cmd was actually helping, in case you can’t tell I actually know what I am doing, and if I see more of this disingenuous way of providing service, I will absolutely not hesitate to report you to The Department of Fair Trading as being fraudulent.

So we'll see, and I'll update. Now I gotta go untangle the mess they left, and uninstall office 2003 (6 hours and they couldn't make 2013 install, so let's just put 2003 instead.) 

**How did this happen??? I left her alone with her computers for 36 hours.** 
I have already agreed to bi monthly support....How my sanity will fare is something else entirely.

Wish me luck :(

**OBLIGATORY EDIT: So, have since discovered that the computer that supposedly has office 2003 on it..... has no office at all, and that midway through yesterday they got my MIL to download sandisk secure access utility, and run it. But the question is.... what for?**

**OBLIGATORY EDIT 2: All the formatting I do seems to work except for paragraphs... I can't get line breaks to work, so**

 Lots of people say, I'm not racist but.... followed by a racist statement.


 I'll set the scene by only saying my post is based on observations and nothing more.


 So the year was 2009 and I'd been working for ACTWF (awesome company to work for) for a few years on a global project deploying an application across the initial pilot countries.


 Project managers had come and gone and the majority of the people on the project were contractors. Not many worked directly for ACTWF.


 I worked in the technical deployment team, rolling out the software to our remote sites. We were a pretty crackshot team, always getting our work deployed and up an running by the end of each go live period (ok we were good, that's the main thing to note)


 Our team leader, a non technical guy had been with us for a while. He was in his late 50s early 60s, Indian, gave off the vibe of being self entitled and better than everyone around him. Probably about 5 ft 7 and neither fat nor skinny. We'll call him coughy pants (CP)


 One of the guys in my team was hot shit, he knew it too, but wasn't overly cocky, just knew he good. He was about 6ft 5 probably 260 - 280lbs and basically just a massive unit. He had a thick Scottish accent, so when you're reading his line, do so as if you were Braveheart. Let's call him William Wallace (ww).


 So CP had been working with us a while, wasn't great at his job, but rode on our success.


 The day before the incident he wasn't looking great, but as is life, you get sick occasionally through the year. Worthwhile nothing here that CP  sat next to WW


 So ww and I were in early, working away, checking the system, scripting deployments chatting away etc.


In comes CP, looking like death. Coughing away and generally just looking like he shouldn't be anywhere near work. He didn't have any important meetings on, and looked like he was trying to be a martyr.


So he sits down next to WW and goes into a coughing fit. It's important to note here, WW was a contractor and nothing got in the way of him billing.


Cough cough cough.....


WW looks at CW and in a strong Scottish accent said, 'CP if you make me sick, I'll KICK YOU IN THE CUNT!'


I couldn't believe he'd said that, said it at work, and said it to our boss. 


Anyway CP got up and moved desks and left the office not long after and went home to sleep I only hope.


Anyway to this day I still laugh about this, WW, if you're reading this, you are the funniest grumpy fucker I know.

dennisthetiger,6,6,1nn0ei,28,"I'm certain that many of you are experienced in a certain phenomenon.  Oftentimes, if you are a) working in any technical field, and b) live with people who, well, don't, you are the de facto expert on those things technical.  This could be anything of a technical nature, be it automotive repair, plumbing, culinary, medicine, or, well, the humble yet complex computer.

Well, in my home, I'm the resident computer expert, as this is what I went to school for, and this is what I do from my small ersatz office (all of maybe 25 square feet in my bedroom) on a daily basis, for upwards of 40 hours per week.

Yes, I work in technical support.  

So on this evening, I'm off of work, making dinner, and enjoying a double gin and tonic after a particularly ugly day of two virus removals (one of which seems to have been on a computer that really needs to be replaced instead of kept on life support) and a final call that was, all considered, particularly pleasant (woman worried about her anti-spyware program not working, when all along, $security_software is working just fine and doing the job, and here are a few other simple things to fix while I'm remoted in), I get the dreaded words from a roommate's bedroom. 

""Oh, shit!  /u/dennisthetiger, my computer's dead!""

...fsck.  I'm now tipsy, dinner's about ready, and this happens.  

Now, my roommate is going for nursing school right now - she's on the last quarter of her pre-nursing stuff, and is going to be waiting for the next opening in a program once she completes this.  So naturally, all of her online coursework depends on a computer.  She does, of course, have a netbook, but, well, it's a netbook - not really fully adequate for the job.  Still, she and another roommate have some medical background, so they're good for a triage-grade diagnosis if something medical-flavored goes wrong with my body.  So if I sprain my ankle something fierce, they can bind me up before we get to the ER.

Initial triage: no POST.  I hear the drive chatter, but absolutely nothing on the display.  No beeps, either, but going into surgery later turns up the reason for that.  I power off.

Well, ya know what?  I'm doing communal dinner of spagetti tonight.  Dinner's ready, let's eat.  

So I eat, I finish my gin and tonic, and it's time for surgery.  The computer still waits, a single blue light facing away from me, forlornly waiting for something to happen.  Maybe to be put out to pasture.

Screwdriver, and open.  No evidence of failure - no scent of burnt electronics, no evidence of blown capacitors.  This is an Asus board in a Dell case, and, oh, hello, more USB hubs on the board that aren't being used, shiny.  Something about that later.  Clearly not a disk failure.  Doublecheck other caps near the onboard video (a 2 GB inbuilt card of some flavor), we're good so far.  But why didn't it beep?

Pop the front of the case off, and...a distinct lack of a case speaker.  Well, that's why we can't have nice beeps.  Dammit.  That doesn't make my job easy, does it?

Check the RAM.  It's seated.  

Fsck it.  Reseat the ram.  Kind of like waving a dead chicken over it, but it's our last hope, I suppose.

As I push down on one of the DIMMs, I feel the motherboard sort of settle down, as if something were holding it up.  This may have well caused the problem, but still, test.

Power up, and there's the POST for the drive again.  After a moment, I get drive chatter.  Add video, black screen.  Fuck.  Maybe it is the video.

...and then, Windows is starting.  It would seem, the, that perhaps whatever was holding up that corner of the motherboard was the cause of failure, in still slightly tipsy retrospect - my running theory is that, despite all things, something warped the motherboard *juuust* enough to lose partial contact with one of the DIMMs.

I power down, plug it all back in, power up, and she's live.  Then, well, it's time to sleep, please shut down, 'k, Dennis?. 

...oy gevalt.  

Well, you know what, she's a close friend, and I want to see her get by in school.  And, well, bronchitis, which is being treated.  She needs her rest for classes tomorrow.

I think I need [a new t-shirt](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/388b/), though.  Or not.  I'm too nice for that one, perhaps. 

tl;dr: the last thing the plumber wants to do at home is so much as look at a fecking plunger.  Good news - the plunger is easy to operate and works most of the time.

s2762679,7,1,1nn027,21,"Background; I work help desk at a college. We used an ancient Unix mail server back in the day. A few years ago a new exchange server was setup and so began the migration of accounts. One catch; users could opt out of the migration and remain on Unix using their comfy-but-oh-so-rubbish Eudora mail client.

So today I get a call from the head of a non-technical part of our college that goes a little something like this;

Client: Last year we had email-alias set up for a shared group calendar in outlook for appointments, I had this deleted as the staff member who administered this is no longer with us and I set up my own. I'm trying to share it with my department but the option is greyed out.

I'm thinking great! Concise, somewhat technical user! This will be a good start to the day. Oh how wrong I was.

Me: General niceties, team viewer in, observe issue.

Turns out client had made a local calender within her outlook and as such could not share it. The way our system is set up you can only share a calendar associated to an email-alias. Easy mistake to make, I forgave her as I appreciated the gusto originally displayed, and proceeded to advise I would need to make a new alias in our database, set it up as another account in outlook, and then it should work for her.

Me: Ok I have created the alias, password is XXXXXXXX log in is ALIAS-NAME2, and I have configured it to outlook for you. Simply right click on ALIAS-CALENDAR-NAME and click ""share"" - punch in email addresses and you're done.

Client: K thx bye.

Client hangs up, and all is well in the world.

Cue all hell to break loose and client to fly off every handle available.

Client calls back.

Client: It won't let me send the invitations!

She is noticeably pissed off at this point.

Me: Ok let me team viewer in again and check it out.

Sure enough some of her target contacts are not showing up (most work, a few don't) in the outlook directory. Hunch is the contacts are still on the old Unix server. Check our database for offending contacts and sure enough, unix users. Explain this to the client.

Client: WHY CAN'T THEY ACCESS THE EXCHANGE CALENDAR!?

Me: Because they aren't on exchange, they would need to migrate across to use exchange features.

Client: This is bull shit! They are part of the same college, I can normally email them fine and now you have broken my email.

Me: You can still email them fine, you're trying to send an invitation to use an exchange only feature to a non-exchange user. It will not work.

Client: This is rubbish. All staff here should be able to do this, blah blah blah rant for a good 30 seconds without taking a breath. Client has successfully demoted herself to ignorant, obnoxious, technology hating user who thinks the help desk is her pin cushion.

At this point I politely but firmly cut her off as we are already down 3 people from the team today who are sick, and the call queue has had people on hold for 12 minutes and counting.

Me: Sorry, Client, but there is nothing I can do for this right now. You need to understand that exchange features will only work for exchange users. Not unix users. It is like me trying to put diesel into my gas car. It just won't go. I have not broken anything. Your service works fine. The problem is that your staff opted out of the exchange migration we started a few years ago to remain on Unix and now the implications of this have caught up with them. To resolve this the staff must be on exchange - no other alternative. Kindly have them email me a written authorisation to migrate the accounts to exchange and I can have you up and running within the hour. The request must come from the owner of each email account so we have their approval. Have a nice day.

Click.

Guess who sends an email after lunch today? Client. Guess what is says?

""migrate staff-member-1 and staff-member-2 from Unix to Exchange"".

I don't know if I speak Klingon, she is ignorant, or just trying to stir me up.

TL;DR: Head of department's staff refused to migrate to exchange, head of department proceeds to rage quit at me for this when it was her responsibility to ensure her staff put through the relevant migration request, and as they are on Unix they can't access an exchange calendar.

ericbrow,15,26,1nmuu5,159,"I used to work as a tech in a shop that supported small businesses and homes.  One of our customers was a county 911 center.  The director had lost some information at some point in the recent past because he had stopped checking up on the backups on his local machine (something he didn't want to pay us to check).  Since that fiasco, we set up a system where his stuff would get backed up to the server, and then backed up, and we did check the server backup.  One day he had been working on a document and ""lost"" it.  He called our office and I unfortunately picked up the phone.  ""It's gone, my document is gone.  You guys had better have been checking those backups because LIVES ARE ON THE LINE HERE.  This is the XXXXX County 911 Center and this is of VITAL importance!""  He flipped out further, but you get the gist.  I asked him a few questions about what he had been doing, and it sounded to me like he had just forgotten where he stored it, but first he demanded that I check his backups.  After checking his backups (something our company did daily as a paid service for them), I then started trying to get back to his document, but he started freaking out again on how we had to get that information back because ""lives were on the line"".  I finally interrupted him.  ""Is this how you train your dispatchers to act in times of crisis?""  He finally calmed down, and checked his Word history, as I had been trying to get him to do, and found his document.  The life saving information?

I try to print out a test page, and it goes through the motions and then I look at the printer's screen and see that it says it's out of paper.

""That can't be the case, there's paper in it,"" she says clearly frustrated with this printer. I go and look at where she has it put and realize, the paper isn't where it should be.

ophhandles,29,49,1nmq50,258,"[This story](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1nlvmb/musical_fucking_desks/) ~~Inspired~~ Triggered memory of this event from early in my career and the PTSD that goes along with it. It happened 4 days after I had stopped smoking weed, which does not excuse my behaviour, but explains it to some extent.

I hate musical desks.

Once had a whole department to move, they actually did the right thing, and provided a diagram of the new seating arrangements a week beforehand (I know, fucking amazing!), but it all goes down hill from there.

I had spent a couple of hours planning the move, most efficient order to do things and patch phones etc. while minimising impact on staff, and provided my plans to the Department Head. Get to my office on the day of the move (the move was happening at a different office about 5 kms away, and was scheduled for that afternoon), to piles of emails and voicemails saying the phones weren't working.

I realise that they had already moved their PCs and other equipment. Turns out their department head had ordered them all to move their equipment before they left the office on the previous day.

Now they were all at new desks with incorrect phone extensions. Did I mention that this was the telesales/telemarketing department?

So, I was blasted by the Dept Head for not having the phones patched (despite referring him to the email with the seating diagrams and timings I had scheduled for the moves, I ended up telling him that I would be there at 2pm as scheduled and that it was not my problem or my fault his staff did not have phones). Then I got blasted by my manager for mouthing off to the Dept Head, and was ordered to go straight to the other building to ""fix up my shit.""

When I arrive nearly the whole team is waiting to tell me that their phone needs to be done first. So I get to it and start patching. I'm in the comms room, 3 cables in each hand and 2 cables in my mouth, and one of these guys comes in (I already didn't like this guy, he was a total wanker) and starts nagging that his phone still isn't working, and that his is the most important, and should have been done first (you know like he and the rest of them had all told me when I walked in.)

I fucking lost it and unloaded.

Me - ""WHAT THE FUCK DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M DOING FUCKHEAD! WHAT IS YOUR FUCKING EXTENSION NUMBER?

Him - ""xxxx""

Me - ""GOOD, SEE THIS CABLE? THIS IS YOUR EXTENSION! SEE THIS?"" *cuts RJ45 plug off the cat5.* ""YOU ARE NOW GOING LAST BECAUSE SOMEHOW YOUR CABLE IS BROKEN, NOW LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHEN YOUR PHONE IS DONE! FOR FUCKS SAKE!""

Epilogue:

Got formal written warning for my behaviour.

Made batch file to restart Department Head and Telesales Guys PCs when I was bored.

Throttled their network connections.

Their tickets were always lowest priority or ""lost"".

Space_Lobster,60,85,1nmoc6,379,"So here is the story of a *clears throat* user. So a bit ago, we had given a ""new"" laptop to a new recruit to the facilities. I didn't have anything to do, so I volunteered to help this individual. (I was still new at the time) I go to the (l)users location and start my usual small talk with the questions. ""Have you ever used this program/vpn/etc"" If they answer no, I'm usually more than happy to assist. Ok...so here is the story:

The laptop came with a docking station and a laptop lock. As we're talking and I am showing the user how to VPN into the network, I had another user want to ask me a quick question, before I walked away I said ""Take the time to set up everything the way you want, here is the laptop lock cable, tie it to something solid once you position the dock/monitors."" 

I walk away for about 10 minutes to look at a printer, as I'm coming around the bend I see a laptop gliding out of a cubicle and what sounds like glass breaking. I take a deep breath, I come up to the cubicle:

Me: ""...""

User: ""well...you said tie it something solid, and I did.""

Me: ""Yeah..I figured the monitor stand (they're anchored into the desk/most people hook it there), the cable hole in the desk you know..something solid..

User: Now what?

So, what did the user use to anchor their laptop? A desk lamp. No, I'm not kidding, the fucking..desk..lamp. Desk.....LAMP. Why did the laptop go flying? Apparently the user went to stand up and lift the dock, however with the force that was used the laptop came out of the dock, bending all the pins on both pieces of equipment and shattered the lamp inside the cubicle. It was one of those moments where I just went to the team leader and said ""You need to see this""

I don't know what happened personally, but I do know the user had to pay for ever thing that was damaged. I thought stuff like this only happened in movies. Apparently I can see where the inspiration comes into play.

howaboutlove,25,4,1nmnlc,59,"This comes courtesy of my fiancé who is a web developer.

His team is currently developing the Spanish version of the company's website. One of the people who is ""helping"" with the translation is a crazy woman who, if something isn't right the first time, e-mails not only the developer, but the developer's boss and/or boss' boss complaining that it isn't perfect.

Last week, she e-mailed my fiancé to have a feature added. He added it. Cue the e-mail to him and his boss' boss (one of the company's vice presidents) with the helpful bug report of “It doesn't work.”

He tested what he changed. It worked. He checked the code. It worked. He tested it again. Still worked. He even sent me a link to the site and it worked for me. He clicked around the site a little and found a 404 error. 

Normally, if this lady had been nice, he would have e-mailed her back and say that he didn't see anything wrong with the new feature, but he had seen that this other thing was broken, so he fixed that. Because she felt the need to CC his boss' boss, however, he didn't feel like being generous, so he e-mailed everyone back and asked her to clarify what didn't work.

This left her in the position of having to reproduce an issue that didn't exist anymore or look foolish in front of a VP. She just sent, “As of today, it works.” 

Unfortunately, I doubt she'll learn anything from this. It's like she's incapable of being shamed.

justaserver33,13,8,1nmlvl,67,"Hey, so this is my first post in this sub and I felt I just needed to share. 

**Background** 

I work as a contractor for a Big Government Agency (BGA from now on), and right now I am on Help Desk for a particular system. There are 8 of us on this helpdesk and we got maybe 30 tickets or emails a day for anything from a password reset to OH GOD THE SYSTEM IS DOWN. So all in all nothing too special. 


now along comes Oct 1st, and lo and behold congress does not pass funding. 

**here's where it gets interesting**

Turns out that as a contractor I cant do *ANY* work for them until funding comes back, but BGA still has people that need to do work, and some that work is done on the system I support. 

Now my first thought was:""Ok, so there will be less users so even less tickets, shouldn't be too bad when we can get back into the system"" 

Oh how wrong I was...

So my coworkers and I have been shuffled off to our parent company's office location and are basically killing time on the clock waiting to go back to BGM and our actual jobs when one of my coworkers, who has remote access to the email folder, drops this on us. 

We have been getting 150+ emails a day since the shut down!!! AND WE CANT TOUCH A SINGLE ONE TILL FUNDING COMES BACK!!

I am not sure what I am more afraid of, the state of the system when we are allowed back, or the massive number of emails and tickets we will have to sort through and fix... 

sorry just needed to share

CheesecakeTruffles,22,6,1nmili,26,"I do believe this is my first post here. Yay! 

I work as a volunteer technician at a high school. I do pretty much all the work that the district technicians are supposed to do, but are so overbooked they don't have the time. Today, I had my first worthy tale...


I walked into my usual morning classroom this morning, and swiftly noticed a sign standing out from the usual labels on the computer lab; it read ""DOESN'T WORK, DON'T TURN ME ON.""

After a short giggle and a private that's what she said moment, I swigged the rest of my coffee and took the sign off. Pressing the power button, I awaited the terror to come. Surprisingly the machine did, indeed, work. I got an immediate chkdsk; let it run. Stuck.

Rebooted the machine and skipped the ensuing chkdsk, and took over with root control... and this is where the fun began. Running low on coffee, I wasn't prepared to meet the monstrosity before me. Twenty gigabytes of new, random information on the disk. But I didn't know where! Onwards, to investigation!

I opened the command line, and ran a short, simple scan disk and scheduling a /f parameter for a boot-up chkdsk. 

This new chkdsk revealed that several key components of the disk (They're all networked computers, and get a partial boot from the network) were corrupted. Oh no! As it happens, there's only one person I know capable of doing this! Justice, away! 

Coincidentally that very person walked in seconds later. After a short question and answer session, I am told he ran a batch file a friend wrote for him. After facepalming and shortly explaining the AUP violation, I examine the file.

It's a poorly written batch for making a new directory, and then copying a text file entitled ""Apple.txt"" with the word apple in the file. 

Unfortunately, user permissions on our network do not allow for the creation of new directories. Oddly enough, the batch defaulted to simply creating user level folders, twice. Completely filled with apple.txt all the way to apple2000000.txt

This batch, as I came to find out, crashed the computer because it had no stop function, the third time it tried to create a new archive (Probably a few minutes into running the script) it failed, and corrupted the archive it was currently in. The script did the unthinkable then - and began to overwrite at random anything on the disk. Destroyed the pagefile (._.) And managed to break the windows boot process. With a file generator. 

Re-imaging the drive now. Seriously looking at user permissions as well. I wonder sometimes, what goes through these kids minds as to what's even SANE when it comes to using these computers...

Hmm. Yeah, maybe just download it again, probably a hiccup or two (they happen). 


**Waka_:** 

&gt;User, 

&gt;It sounds like an issue with your computer or browser. Try right-clicking the document and going to ""Save As..."" or ""Save Link As..."" or ""Save Target As..."" and see if it works then. If you're getting the same error message, ask your instructor if they are able to open the documents on their computer. 


&gt;Waka_


Well, no problem, right? Not simple, as the user explains

**PhDumb:**
&gt;Nope. Right clicking does not provide me with the Save As option, 
probably because the docs are PDFs and I'm viewing them in Acrobat. The 
only option I have in the File field is Save As, and yes, that's what 
seems to be the issue.

&gt;The instructor reports that she can download-save-reopen the documents.

Uhh…...

&gt;*And yes, that's what seems to be the issue*

Whatever.

Gambatte,18,23,1nlyp1,116,"In the last installment, I related the story of **Brilliant Guy**. In the comments, I mentioned that I later discovered he was getting paid exactly the same amount I was, and /u/forsaken1111 asked ""What if he was being paid MORE than you?""

Well, this is the first of many stories of Brilliant Guy's **Moronic Mentor** (MM), who was getting paid considerably more than either of us. I was freshly minted, almost straight out of school, and MM was working on a piece of kit and required a length of cable with specific connectors that we did not have on hand and couldn't create from existing cables with adaptors.

But we did have the raw cable, crimp connectors and a crimping tool. So out came the side cutters, cable was measured to the length required (plus about two feet of slack) and cut, and the first connector was carefully crimped to the cable, making sure all standards and procedures were followed correctly.

&gt; MM: This is taking too long!

&gt; ME: Almost done, MM, I just need to crimp this last connector.

&gt; MM: No! You're too slow, give me that!

MM proceeded to snatch the crimp connector out of my hand and ram it on to the end of the cable (ignoring all best practices and company procedures), then grabbed the **side cutters** from the bench and promptly *cut through the connector and cable*.

Stupid mistake, right? No one would make that mistake, twice, right? No, MM then proceeds to use *the very same pair of side cutters* to strip back the cable again, rams another connector on the end *and cuts through it again*.

&gt; MM: This crimping tool is obviously broken!

&gt; ME: MM, that's not a crimping tool.

&gt; MM: Don't talk back to me, I'll report your insubordination to your supervisor!

So again, being inexperienced, I stood down and let him carry on - but in a moment when MM was distracted, I palmed a connector into my pocket. *Three more times* he cut through the connector before he ran through the entire stock of connectors - except the one in my pocket. Fuming, he told me I was ""useless"" and stormed out to get my immediate supervisor.

As soon as he was gone, I stripped the cable back (now much shorter than when first cut), crimped on the last remaining connector, and quickly cleaned up (holding on to a few cut connectors as evidence). MM returned a few moments later (with my supervisor in tow), and I presented MM with the completed cable.

After MM stormed off, looking for someone to vent his anger on, my supervisor asked me:

&gt; IS: What was that all about?

&gt; ME: He can't tell the difference between a pair of side cutters and a crimping tool, even when it's pointed out to him, or even after he's destroyed very nearly every crimp connector that we had in stock.

&gt; IS: ಠ_ಠ

&gt; IS: He's your superior, so you shouldn't be saying that about him.

&gt; ME: *(oh shiiiiii)*

&gt; IS: ...But he's not mine, and I find that to be completely in keeping with my previous experience with MM.

Soon after, MM was shuffled off to another part of the company, where he (supposedly) could do no harm. So they thought...

ligerzero459,47,55,1nlu5b,259,"Reading /u/mcsparklenuts stories reminded me of a few interesting uses of scripting I've been forced to write to make my shops lives easier. This story involves a group I'll call ""higher level"". I've got plenty more stories involving ""higher level"", if anyone wants to hear them. Like the time they decided all the NIC drivers needed to be updated...but that's a story for a different day. 

I work for the Air Force and at the local levels, we barely have any permissions. No AD access, no SCCM rights. Large software updates and pushes are done by ""higher level"". Now, they don't have the brightest people there unfortunately. So they have a tendancy to push out updates that break things and then refuse to take responsibility and leave us to clean up the mess.

All of our computers require a digital cert to log onto our domain. We have software on each machine that validates the cert. If they software isn't working, you end up with an error because the cert can't be checked to see if it's revoked. Enter the ""higher level"". They decide they're going to push an update to this software. Unfortunately, they did no tests and end up breaking a significant portion of the network. The broken computers can't login and people are getting antsy because ""work can't be done"".

In swoops our tech guru, N. N is our best tech, and figures out that a simple reinstall of the program will fix it. Great! We get that information up to ""higher level"" and expect it to be fixed. Fast-forward a few hours and ""higher level"" comes back saying they didn't break anything and we need to fix it on our level. Our direct leadership doesn't argue and tells us to do it. That means reinstalling this software on a significant amount of computers, something like 1700 or so. And they want us to remote into each one to do it, one at a time.

My immediate thought was ""F*** that noise, there has to be another way."" I remembered that N had mentioned PSExec to me a few days before. After about 30 minutes of research, I wrote up a short script that copied the files from the server, executed them using PSExec and then restarted the computer. Tested it on a machine in the office and it worked like a charm. Managed to bang out a multiple machine version in another 10 minutes and turned to multi-hour installation job by the entire shop into a 2 hour job on one machine. Ran the script on all the affected machines and we haven't gotten another call since. ","We Broke It, You Fix It",314
12stringPlayer,7,1,1nlrd4,31,"Hi, TFTS!  It was about time for me to sign up and give back to the folks here that have given me so many facepalm moments. I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves and I hope we've passed the audition.

This tale goes back to the heady days when I was a Unix consultant and making some very good money.  I knew some people at a company a bit south of Boston that was one of two that had been bought by a British firm, and the Brits were closing down the other company and moving its data center from Washington DC to a co-location site in Boston.  When the people I knew heard I was available, they hired me on, even though I'd given them my ""I really don't want this job"" rate without blinking an eye.  ""Damn,"" I thought - ""I left money on the table.""

I went in to meet with them, and they introduced me to their recently-hired ""Senior UNIX System Administrator"" (his actual title) after apologizing for not knowing I was available for the job.  This guy was well over 300 lbs, and friends of mine told me they ran when they saw him heading for the bathroom, as such visits tended to leave the area around completely stenchified for at least an hour afterwards.  At one point we traveled down to Washington to see the site we were to move, and it was the first time I'd ever seen an airline have to pull out the seatbelt extender.  I really felt sorry for the person that had to sit next to him on the flight, as she only had about 6"" of seat left after his lardass was in place.

But that's not what I came to tell you about. Came to talk about the draft. 

I did not have much respect for this person as a SysAdmin.  He freely admitted that the most valuable tool in his kit was his Rolodex of vendor support numbers.  At his previous job, there was no hardware or software that was without a full [platinum level](http://www.theregister.co.uk/Print/2008/04/18/bofh_2008_episode_14/) support contract.  There was little he'd ever had to do when a problem arose other than call one of the numbers in his Rolodex for help.

Fast forward a few weeks to a miserable New England day in February, the kind of day where the weather can't decide whether it wants to snow or rain, so it compromises and pelts down sleet and freezing rain which, once it hits the ground, is buckets o' slush until later in the day when it freezes in place and won't budge until some time in May.  This day found me happily working from home over my dedicated 56K line (hot shit at the time!), all warm and cozy with my modded Sun IPX and my Amiga 3000 to keep me company.  (Yeah, I'm old.  Get off my lawn.)

This blissful scene was interrupted by a call from the supposed Senior Sysadmin, who told me there was a problem with the new Sun server that had been leased to manage the backups and the tape library.  I'd had it all set up and there wasn't anything on it other than the OS and the oddball backup software he'd had the company buy, so I couldn't imagine what was wrong.  I into the spiffy virtual KVM that had been installed, and found that I couldn't log in as myself nor as root.  ""That ain't right,"" I said to myself.  I rebooted and the system came back up, but I still couldn't log in.  Now I'm really scratching my head.  I told him I couldn't log in at all, and that we'd probably have to boot off the Solaris CD to see what was wrong.

""Boot off the Solaris CD?  Which one is that?""

""Um, the one that says Solaris 2 that I left in the rack last week when we installed the server.  Call the co-lo's 'helping hands' number and have them put the CD in the drive.""

""Oh, I didn't want to leave that around, so I put it in my bag before we left.""  Never mind that we had a number of them in the office already; never mind that their intrinsic value approached zero; he'd put it in his bag for safekeeping.

""Well I guess you'll have to drive up to Boston to bring it back there,"" I said.

""Could you do it?"" he asked.  I believe I invented the facepalm at that moment.  Now, usual time to Boston for me was about 90 minutes, but on that day it could have easily approached 3 hours, so I declined.  Some whining about how it was expected tomorrow occurred but it wasn't my problem and I told him so.  

Off he went to Boston, and I figured that was the end of it, but that wouldn't be a TFTS, would it?  The real WTF-ery came once he finally arrived in Boston.  My phone rang, and I heard this: ""OK, I'm at the co-lo, what do I do now?""  Wait, what?

""Put the CD in the drive and boot into single user mode.""

""Yeah - **How do I do that?**""

Let's take a moment to note two points here:  
* The instructions for booting a Sun from the CD were printed inside the CD's cover  
* He was hired as a **Senior UNIX System Administrator.**.  Not a junior, not a trainee, not even a PFY-wannabe, but a Senior SysAdmin.

I took a deep breath, had him insert the CD and booted into single user mode via the KVM and mounted the filesystems, where I found that the root partition was 100% full, whereas yesterday it had been under 10% full.  Not only that, there was a single file that was taking up all that space - /etc/passwd.  On top of that, it was a file filled with nothing.  I needed more information.  Sadly, the default shell at this time was the plain Bourne shell which had no command history for me to look at.

""What were you doing with this system?""

""Nothing...   just checking out the tape drive.  Trying to write a file to it.""

""Uh huh.  Which file?""

""Uhhhh, the password file.""

At that moment, I knew all.  He'd tried to give the command  
    backup_command /etc/passwd &gt; /dev/rmt0  
but instead ended up typing  
    backup_command /etc/passwd &lt; /dev/rmt0  
which happy started reading the entire empty tape into /etc/passwd.

Oy.

I restored the default /etc/passwd from the (fortunately there had been only one account added, mine) and the root partition was instantly back down to its previous level.  Whew!

So, there's my tale of stupidity for the day.  ""But... But... the title of the story is Backstabbery!  Where's that come into play?"" I hear you cry.  Well, I couldn't let this go, so I went to my friend, this asshat's boss, and told him that his ""senior"" sysadmin didn't even know how to boot a Sun from a CD.  He shook his head, saying that he was the best of a small number of applicants (this was a while ago, remember!).

The next day I got a call from my friend who told me that he'd fired the asshat.  The move went great after that.  High visibility clients never saw downtime, and the project came in on schedule and under budget.  I got a big bonus followed by a job offer which I took.  Don'tcha love a happy ending?

InfamousBLT,7,10,1nlnw2,90,"So this happened today. I'm still not entirely sure why, but okay. 

Working on a problem report last night, I am able to determine the issue is not on our end, it's some other vendor's problem. I inform the customer of this and hold on to my ticket pending additional information while they talk with the other vendors to either get me additional information about the problem, or figure the problem out on their end. No problem, the is run of the mill stuff for my job. I mark the ticket as such and move on.

Although I did notice the system engineer I asked to gather said information cc'ed some manager in a completely unrelated department. This happens occasionally...usually it's no big deal, so I let it slide. This manager then emails me and asks me why I haven't escalated it to his team yet. So he's confused...he's a manger, not technical at all, fine. I explain it's not his problem, in fact it's not even our companies problem, and leave it at that. This kind of thing is also not uncommon...the systems guys want the best support they can get, I understand that.

This morning I come in to a slew of emails. Apparently he didn't think I was correct, so he sent the issue to some hardware engineers under him. Which is weird, considering that even if there WAS something wrong on our end, it's a software issue...not a hardware issue. Now I'm a little peeved that he's 

a) Bothering engineers who have better things to do

b) Not letting me do my job

So I explain again...this is not your issue, it has nothing to do with you, please let me do my job. One of my co-workers (who does hardware) also sends a similar email to the guy. I figure this will surely do the trick. The engineers he sent it to also said the same thing. I figure that SURELY we must be done with this insanity at this point.

2 hours later I see he sent an email to a completely different (again, completely unrelated) software engineering team. He then sends an email to some other higher ups and my boss asking why we don't have a support process for this (uh, we do, you just are choosing to ignore it). In the meantime the 2nd engineering team says the same things I already said...not our issue, we need more information, etc.

So he escalates it to upper management. For no reason at all, since again...there is no problem on our end, and the ticket is already solved.

It was at this point that I found his name in the system, assigned the ticket to him, and sent an email over to my boss informing her that I'm no longer working on the ticket because this random manager in another department has decided to join our support team. She, being the awesome boss she is, sent him an email informing him as such and backed me up fully.

I figure if he wants to do my job, he may as well get the credit for it. So now a manager in charge of hardware development owns his very own software support ticket, and as far as my boss is concerned, he will be responsible for working on it.

When you work for a small company, you get to know the customers pretty well.  Most of the customers that called in for support were very nice, genuine folks who just needed a bit of help.  One of them was a repeat caller that lived way out in the sticks, so phone line quality was always an issue.  Many times, it was just changing the init string to deal with more/less noise.  This was especially important for those living on farms with electric fences as electric fences almost always were unproperly grounded and interferred with phone lines with a noticeable *tick* sound every 3-4 seconds.  


Anyway, this lady called in and said she was having worse issues than usual.  I just smiled as it meant going in and resetting her init string to something more stringent.  While walking her through the process, I hear what sounds to be a grinding noise on the phone.  It was way different from the usual electric fence *tick*.  The conversation then went like this:

She calls back in later that evening on a number I didn't recognize on caller ID (her cellphone - she had to drive 15 minutes to get into cell phone range) and was laughing her head off.  It turns out she had just got off the phone with her phone company (Verizon at the time.  This was back around 2005 or so, many years before Frontier bought the lines here off them) and getting a tech dispatched out for line repair. 


Curious, I asked her why she needed line repair.  She responded thusly:  ""One of my cows got out of the field and was chewing on the phone line because some grass was growing up along it near the pole because I hadn't mowed yet this week.""

bainpr,25,6,1nlivl,47,"Hello TFTS!

I submitted my first story for you guys yesterday and you seemed to enjoy it(http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1njm6m/it_just_wont_turn_on/). I figured I could share another one.

This summer we had the joys of having a summer school class in the room next to our office. Now having the class next to us didn't bother us, it was who was teaching it that bothered us. We will call her Derpina. Derpina is normally in a different building, so we can kind of avoid her for the most part, she is a problem user. She likes to complain that computers are having issues, such as running slow, internet not working and the usual. I would say 90% of the time its user error or nothing actually wrong when we get there. 

One fine day half way through the summer she comes bursting into our office. 

Derpina: I need your help right away!

Bainpr: What do you need help with?

Derpina: I need to use the smartboard in the classroom next door.

Bainpr: Ok, whats wrong?

Derpina: Its just blue.

Bainpr: Ok give me a minute to finish up what I'm working on and I will come look at it. 

Just a quick side note, a Smartboard is a touch responsive board that you can project your display on to.

I walk next door and look at the smart board. The computer and projector are turned on, she is also logged in. I am fairly impressed at how well she did up to this point. I mean she successfully turned on the projector the monitor and computer(round of applause).  On the top right corner of the smart board is displayed VIDEO 2(no input). I pick up the remote for the projector and push the button labeled Computer 1. TADA!

Derpina: HEY! You fixed it! That's amazing how did you do that?

Bainpr: I selected the Computer input on the projector ma'am.

Derpina: (bewildered) How do you do that?

Bainpr: You just push the button labeled computer on the projector remote ma'am.

Derpina: Wish I knew that before. oh well, now I do.

She has been in the district for over 5 years and has a projector in her room. I just quietly left the room and chalked it up as another EUCI(End User Competency Issue).

Play2Tones,21,14,1nlbxn,70,"This is the story of why I joined Reddit, and it's all because of TFTS.

I work in TS for a Tech Company, supporting external customers.  On paper, I love my job, it's very flexible and I have a lot of freedom.  Our internal IT support is out-sourced, because the tech knowledge of the employees would allow us to do some devious things if we had the keys.  So we don't technically have any on-site support to support our technical support department, or any other department.  Sounds like a riddle, right?  Guess who gets to help solve the company's IT problems when there is an emergency and no one on-site to help?  Yup, Play2Tones does.

Well, the best part is that management doesn't understand tech, so they don't follow the standards of the industry.  One such example follows.

Our Warehouse uses shipping software that runs as a client on the warehouse PCs, which communicate with the server in our server room.  The shipping ""server"" is a Dell Optiplex circa 2003, that was previously used as a desktop PC for an Accountant, and it has never been serviced.  Or re-imaged.  Strike 1.

The ""server"" has a single 30Gb HDD which contains the OS and all applications/files, including the 5Gb of archived emails from ""Accountants"" Outlook backup.  I only bring this up because for years (yes years), the Warehouse has been clicking ""cancel"" when prompted to update their shipping software because ""it will break it"".  As you can tell by now, the reason it would ""break it"", there is less than 100Mb of free disk space.  So low and behold, Temp Warehouse Worker wasn't aware of the SOP to reject the software update and clicked ""OK"".  Strike 2 is in here somewhere.

What happens next is that the HDD crashes, and the Warehouse is unable to process shipments.  Shipping Software Support is called, IT Support is called, and Play2Tones is called.  Who fixed it first you wonder?

Well, Shipping Software Support isn't any help, besides stating that the transactions already logged for the day can be processed, but no new shipments.

IT Support can't ping the server (Go Figure), so they ask me what the Server is doing.  This is my first introduction to Mr. Dell Optiplex and all of it's out-dated glory, so my previously stated knowledge was all gleaned after this point.  I entered to a cool gust of refreshing air, in a well-lit but cramped closet with white walls and black cables on the ground.  I identified it by the label on the chassis saying ""Shipping Server"", at the very bottom of a blade rack, on the lonely shelf that has become ubiquitous with death.  Found that the single monitor in the rack (of course it's CRT), is hooked to a switch and the server is connected to input 3.  Switching to the server, blue screen of ""Boot Media Unreadable"" (I don't need IT to tell me it's a HDD failure).

I tell IT that I know what to do, ""pull the HDD and hook it up as a slave to another machine, to hopefully retrieve the database (not-backup up anywhere else).""  Tell them I will need to locate an IDE port somewhere, if there is another machine this old that still works.  IT says ""No, it's probably SATA and we left a drive reader in HR for wiping ex-employee machines"".  Strike 2.5

They're wrong, it's IDE, and no, we don't have any way to connect it.  Now it is 3pm, and EOB is 5pm.  Warehouse now has a queue of shipments waiting to be processed, but can't ship them out.  So I tell my boss I'm going to Worst Buy to get a part, and I will be back before 5pm.  Before I leave, I check online and they have 1 External IDE enclosure in stock.

It takes 30-40 min to drive there, without traffic.  What happens next is nothing that I am proud of (this isn't a fairytale after all), but I get pulled over for speeding.  The cop is really nice about the whole thing, and lets me go with a written warning.  All I had to do was say ""I have to get to Worst Buy and back to the office by 5 so my shipping dept can do their jobs"".  I think I just learned how to not get a ticket, bonus.

So I get to WB, and the computer dept is confident that the part isn't stocked anymore, despite the website inventory.  They direct me to Radiohack, a local electronics (junk) store.  Again, no luck.

So, it's now nearing 5pm, and I call my boss to give him the bad news.  We decide that there is one more store that would probably have it.  It's not close to the office, but it is near my home, so I decide to go.  Get there, get the HDD enclosure, and it's 6:30pm.  I go home with the part, and bring it in the next morning.

When I get connected, I realize how bad the HDD was managed, what with the:

*  Incredibly small size for the data requirements
*  Lack of free space
*  Irrelevant and obsolete data for the current task
*  Sheer age of the HDD used as the sole retention point for business critical data.

I extracted the required stuff, kicked the HDD back into the Optiplex chassis, and loaded the software onto a spare laptop I had laying around.  Granted, I did have to roll up 3 versions to get to current rev, because the data needed to be reformatted as part of a software update, so this took ALL DAY.  Also updated each Warehouse PC with latest rev of Client software, and now the system is stable.

I told my boss that the current server (laptop) should be replaced with an actual server, but seeing as how he has a laptop hidden between his desk and the wall in his office, online, acting as a connector for our customer database to link with outlook server, I don't think he cares.

I also knew that no one cares when I didn't receive a thank you, let alone a raise/bonus since I was hired.  At that realization, I stopped caring and read TFTS for the first time, and now I spend 3-4 hours on reddit EVERY DAY.

laanyan,20,8,1nkyts,45,"I work Desktop Services and I hate connectivity issues.  Mostly, I get annoyed since 75% of them are that the cable just isn't plugged in.  Plus, every single ticket I get says, “The user checked the cables.”  Like I believe that for a second…  I was born at night; it wasn’t last night.

Now, in my opinion, an RJ45 connector doesn’t greatly different from a standard telephone cable connector, which hasn't changed since my grandparents were born; seriously, the standard phone cable was invented in like 1925 (the more you know).  So, having to explain how to connect something essentially the same as a telephone cable (a concept that I feel they should grasp) just irks me up one side and down the other.

I received a call today from a very nice lady who told me she went to bed last night and woke up this morning and now she ""didn't have any wifi on her laptop.""  And that the same thing happened with her iPad as well.


So I start to go through our steps, asking specific questions to get a handle on the situation and try and keep the call moving smoothly.  Then I get to the point of asking her if she can either see the wireless icon in the system tray, or the  lan connection icon.  She seems flabbergasted.    


""I can't see anything!  I told you I don't have wifi.""

MickCollins,33,35,1nkj40,128,"Several years ago I used to work for a very big company. We'll call them Brisby. I worked swing shift from 4 PM to 1 AM in their East Coast call center. I took calls about general Windows shenanigans and password resets for the internal SAP system. I was in a few other queues especially as the night went on, but those are stories for another post. 

The Roy Brisby Company was still a bit old fashioned in some ways. I showed up as a contractor the first day of my employment and I was informed by my ""contact"" with the contracting firm that I'd need to cut my hair. (I'm male, and I wore it long back then - I was 6'2 and it reached pretty much to my ass, so at least two feet long.) I had grown it out for five years and was getting sick of it anyway, so I wasn't super upset - but was also informed that if I had to lose the goatee but could keep the mustache. That was a bit of a surprise. Oh well, I was a recent graduate from college and needed the job. I thought it was pretty stupid since there was zero chance I'd ever run into a customer in the call center, but what can you do. I was also told to watch my language, because the company maintained a pretty strict ""family friendly"" environment. 

I took this call at that time of year when major companies put that little tax on their employees called ""United Way"". I have nothing against United Way itself, but having heard stories from large companies about people involved with cajoling already underpaid employees to give up 2% of their paycheck - well I was never a fan of that.

It's about 9 PM and I get a call from a Security supervisor at one of the hotels on Brisby World property, saying he needs a password reset for one of his team members - so she can go into SAP and donate part of her paycheck to United Way. He doesn't say she's old (as most of the security there is over 55 at the hotels, they just watch, they call in the Brisby Police force if anything is really weird) but the supervisor points out ""she's not really good with computers, she doesn't have much experience with them."" I ask him to put the employee on the phone so I can identify her identity, and he hands me off to the security guard in question.

Me: ""Hello ma'am, how are you tonight?""
Guard: (in a tone that indicated otherwise) ""I'm fine, thank you.""
Me: ""Can I get your SAP number and the answer to your secret question...""
Guard: rattles off needed info
(Takes me about 10 seconds to reset.)
Me: ""Okay ma'am, you have a new password in the form of MickCollins1921. It's case sensitive, and the system will ask you to change the password immediately.""
Guard: ""OK.""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with?""
Guard: ""Can you shut it off so I can't get in?""
Me: ""I'm afraid not, that's beyond my capacity.""
Guard ""*Sigh.* I guess not then.""
Me: ""Okay. I hope you have a better night, ma'am.""
Guard: ""Oh yeah, it's just another wonderful fucking day at Brisby!""
She hung up.

I had a few chuckles afterwards, as I knew it wasn't directed at me.

A few weeks later, my supervisor asks me to come visit him in his office. I knew it wasn't a performance thing, because I was one of the best people he had (I have a work ethic, and even if I'm not making that much, I still work for what I make) - so I wasn't sure what it was about.

He asked me about a call where the user had been cursing. This doesn't happen a lot, but it did occasionally (especially if some of the Brisby TV people came through from BCD - they were always foulmouthed, but I usually chalked it up to most of them being from New York City, having grown up around the Tri-State area) so he had to provide more details.

When he said ""an older woman from Security"" it clicked and I laughed, then looked at him and said ""what about it?"" Well apparently someone ratted her out - either a guest or another guard, maybe some other ""cast member"" or maybe even someone from ""QA"" going over my calls - anyway, because it's in the company handbook, they had to do an investigation into it. 

My statement on the call read: ""The user seemed to be having a bad night. While some colorful language was used, I knew said language was not directed at me."" It wasn't worth lying over, because as I said, someone from QA might have pulled the recording for the call.

I don't know what happened to the guard in the end. I hope she didn't get in too much trouble, since I knew she was just pissed off about having to pay the vig - and I couldn't blame her much for that...

TL, DR: Brisby employee curses on the phone (not at me), get asked about it later, try to mitigate her damage since she's not supposed to curse around guests.","Cursing on a call might not make me upset, but if you have a decency clause in your employment contract, you might have a bad time....",163

Gambatte,26,13,1njqi1,72,"Several years ago, the company I worked for changed its internal requirements, meaning that all technicians who might work on power cabling had to be externally certified (at the company's expense, at least). My team and I flew through the certification course in a couple of days and resumed our normal work load.

At the time, we were supporting technical functions within a building that contained several different specialized schools. One of these schools conducted classified network training (aka how to build networks to safely handle and contain classified material), so everything in that school was locked down to an internal maintenance crew, despite everyone on my team maintaining the appropriate security clearance to do that work as well.

The end of the financial year was fast approaching, and like all good departments, we were finding creative ways to make sure that our accounts were sufficiently empty so as to ensure that our budget didn't get slashed in the coming year. One of the ways we did this was to replace and replenish the extensive collection of tools my workshop maintained.

One of the tools that desperately needed to be replaced was a pair of shears; great big heavy things that would cut through metal like butter - so they were ideal for cutting through large cables one a single clean bite. Not something we did often, which was why these shears had gone so long with out being replaced.

We finally got the shears replaced, and the old pair was disposed of. On the FIRST DAY that the old shears were irrevocably gone from the workshop, Brilliant Guy shows up from the locked-down school maintenance crew. The conversation went more or less as follows:

&gt; BG: Hey, I need to borrow some tools. *(not an uncommon occurrence)*

&gt; ME: Sure thing. What do you need?

&gt; BG: Wire strippers and cutters, mainly... We got some new kit and I need to make up some power leads, but I don't have all the tools I need in the school maintenance kit.

&gt; ME: Oh yeah... Did you get the external certification done?

&gt; BG: Yes! Just finished the course last week, actually.

&gt; ME: Nice. Did you want one of my guys to make up the cables for you? They're not busy, honestly, they could use the extra work.

&gt; BG: Nah, I've got it... I haven't got much on myself, actually.

&gt; ME: No worries. One of the guys will grab the tools for you, just sign for them on your way out. Give me a shout if you need a hand.

Not even 10 minutes later, the power suddenly goes out in the building. We scramble into action, shutting down as much of the servers that are running on UPS as gracefully as possible, basically getting the building into a completely powered-off state without significantly breaking anything. Once we were sure our gear was okay, we started the investigation... Sure enough, the trail leads us straight into the secured school, to the new equipment rack.

As it turned out, Brilliant Guy had wired a power plug on to his cable, plugged it into a live socket, run the reel of now-live cable out to the rack location, then cut through the cable, somehow managing (without causing himself any injury) to trip every breaker between himself and the main building feed, including the main inverter breaker - and melting a perfectly circular section of the jaws of my BRAND NEW SHEARS.

mcsparklenuts,60,99,1njmxw,358,"Hey TFTS! Thanks for your support on last night's story! Here is Chapter 2 of what I hope can become a saga.

[In case you missed the last installment, check it out here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1nh4jd/in_which_i_am_a_fresh_boot_the_wheel_is/)

Oh and to clear something up a little bit, this was while I was in the Marine Corps. Things work a little differently than the other services. I was also promoted to Lance Corporal between the last story and this one. Not really a big difference, just an increase in pay really. It wasn't merit based, just an automatic promotion.

*****

Our office was a confined little space. It wasn’t truly even an office, but an unused vault that had been repurposed. With five of us stuck in this little room, we were a constant fire hazard. You couldn’t move a foot without tripping over someone or something.

Now the way that our office was arranged, there was only one workstation where you could really have any privacy. No one could see what was on your screen and you couldn’t see what was on anyone else’s. Cpl Elvis had long since been banished to this desk (well before I even got there) as it was easily the least sociable spot in the room.

As I was not in this desk, it did not take much casual observation from my cohorts to deduce that I had been the one to write the infamous server check script. The attitude in the room towards me was generally that of indifference however. Most of them were still unsure of me (and my boot-ness). It would take something more to establish my right to coexist with them.

And so it came to pass, my days of scripting were just beginning. Now as a beginner, the scripts were simple at best. I was trying to figure out what I could do and how powerful I could become. I played and played in the little sandbox that was our network. Since this was a training evolution, it didn’t matter what I was doing with anything really. It was as much of a communications exercise as it was a staff training exercise, and my access rights were bountiful.

I didn’t necessarily work from the same workstation every day, so all of my work, including my scripts, was stored in a shared location. There wasn’t really a need to protect anything, so I didn’t implement any folder permissions. This would work in my favor.

So over the next few weeks, I was still fuming over the Cpl Elvis incident from the last installment. I was still furious and plotting my revenge. There had to be an opportunity. Things were never exactly quiet. I needed to do something and place the blame squarely on him. But how?

My thoughts were interrupted by the familiar sound of Outlook receiving an email. “Somebody loves me!” I exclaimed in delight. I Alt+Tab to my email (that’s how you know I’m a *real* computer genius /sarcasm) to read this message from my future lover.

Alas! It was only a policy letter and I was only CC’d. “Blast! I guess love will have to wait for another day.”

I read the policy letter though. Such a dry read, written in military format. And it meant more work. Apparently our Active Directory display name naming standard was not in compliance with DoD standards, and every account would have to be changed from “FName MI. LName” to something like “LName Rank FName (Unit Section Billet)”. This was not going to be a fun task.

As the bitch of the team, I was likely going to be tasked with this. It was another one of those things that no one wanted to do. But wait I might be able to script this! To the internet I went.

Well after a bit of googling and a bit of playing around testing things, I managed to work out a script that did what I wanted it to. Probably could have done it better, but I was happy with what I had worked out, so I was going to run with it.

But I noticed something. Files in my script folder were locked for editing. That could only mean one thing: Someone was going through them. But why? There was nothing really good in there, just the server check script and a couple things that I had been playing around with. To the logs I went. I didn’t really care that someone was looking, but I needed my files.

Cpl Elvis. Once I saw the name, I cared. The anger came flooding right back in, having been forgotten in my work. I needed to do something about him.

And then it came to me, a deviously wonderful idea!

I hadn’t saved my script to the share yet, so I made a backup copy and began my changes. To anyone who casually looked at it, it would appear that the script did exactly what I had initially intended it to do, but I changed a couple of lines to basically make the display names unintelligible. With a second copy, I made a script that would fix the changes to proper order.

I uploaded the former of these scripts to my folder, and kept the latter to myself. As if on cue, SSgt Tony appears at the door.

“Ok gang, I have a task for you. We got a policy letter in and we need to change everyone’s display name, and bring everything up to speed.”

Various methods were discussed as how to go about this. I sat there quietly waiting for a lull in the conversation. Eventually I chime in, “I read somewhere that you can use a script to change the display names. I think we have all the information we need to get it done. Maybe Cpl Elvis could try to do something since he made that server check script.”

SSgt Tony looked at me quizzically. We exchanged a glance and he knew I was up to something, but it seemed he also knew I had a plan. Quickly he turned to Cpl Elvis.

“That’s not a half bad idea. Cpl Elvis, put something together and get it done. I want you to work on this personally. I have other things for the rest of the team. It is your top priority.

Cpl Elvis looked like he had just been hit by a bus that hit him at near light-speed, so I decided to chime in again.

“I’ve been working on some things myself. You might want to look at my folder on the share. There’s some stuff in there that might help you out.”

He was oblivious to my hatred of him apparently and took the as a gesture of friendship. Oh, if he only knew my plan. (insert maniacal laughter here)

It was only a few minutes after the meeting that Cpl Elvis had apparently struck gold. He announced that he had a script ready. After my private assurances to SSgt Tony that nothing was going to be permanently damaged, he gave Cpl Elvis the green light to run the script.

And run it, he did. It took about half a second for the look of self-righteous delight to turn into absolute horror. He stared at Active Directory for a second, but then turned slowly to me.

“This is all *your* fault LCpl McSparklenuts! *YOU* made this happen, and you’re gonna pay big time.”

“Hold on now Cpl Elvis,” chimed in SSgt Tony. “This was *your* script wasn’t it? You made the changes, didn’t you?”

“I.. uhh.. yes. I made it, but I used the stuff that LCpl McSparklenuts had told me would work.”

“LCpl McSparklenuts, can you come take a look at this please?”

I walked over casually and took a look. Sure enough he had run my dummy script (again without changing the heading). “Oh yeah, no I didn’t say it would work. I just told him to take a look at the stuff that I had because it might help, that’s all.”

“Can you fix it?” the fine SSgt asked.

“Probably, give me a couple minutes to take a look at it.” I went back to my desk and pretended to play around with the script a little bit. I closed my editor and ran the script to fix all, and everything was perfect.

After verifying I called out, “SSgt Tony, I’ve fixed everything. All the display names are right now.”
He came over and took a look. 

“Ok just do me a favor and make sure.”

He turned to Cpl Elvis.

“Cpl Elvis, you are hereby banished from this server team. Report to the help desk.”

After he had skulked out of the room, SSgt Tony turned to me and said, “That was some pretty fancy work. What would you have done if it hadn’t worked?”

“I don’t know, probably shit myself SSgt.”

We exchanged laughter. A high five was in order. I had had my revenge, and all was well in the world. Well maybe not at the help desk!

TollhouseFrank,35,31,1nj6f2,135,"This is a tale from a few years ago.  I was doing contract work for Verizon Fios (worked in a contract call center).  Yeah, I know, lousy pay for the amount of stress and crap I had to put up with.  Regular employees got 3x the pay and had benefits.  Anyway, during one particularly stressful day (a few days after I earned the position 'floorwalker' - aka Supervisor without the title and pay), I had a wonderfully 'pleasant' call from a man in New Jersey.


He was hot.  He was cussing.  He was beyond rude.  He didn't even let me finish saying ""Hello"" before he layed into me.  I muted my set and told my immediate supervisor (who was 2 desks away from me) ""I'm gonna get a write-up for this one.  Be prepared when QC contacts you.""  Basically, code for *stop doing what you are doing and patch into this call, it is gonna get ugly*.


After 10 minutes of listening to this man rant and rave, he then threatened to rip the FIOS equipment off the wall and throw it out in the street. This is how the conversation went from there, with the customer labeled as NJ (for the state he was from):


**NJ**: I'm gonna *bleeping* rip your *bleeping* equi-*bleep*-ment off the wall and throw it into the *bleeping* street.  

**Me**: Go ahead.  I am being monitored this call.  Go ahead and do that sir.  Make my day.""

**NJ**: *sounds of equipment being ripped out of the wall and being thrown out a window*

**Me**:  "" You may also wish to contact a carpenter to fix the hole you just ripped in your wall.  I am also contacting your local office to come get your equipment as you are too stupid to realize you just cost yourself several hundred dollars in fees for destroying our equipment.""

**NJ**: *cusses and screams and demands for a supervisor so he can get me fired*

**Me**: ""Yessir.  Even though I count as a supervisor, I will get you my supervisor.""

**Supervisor**: ""Sir, I heard the whole thing.  While my tech WILL be getting a write-up for being a general dick to you, the police have already been contacted and sent to your address for destruction of Verizon Property.  Have a nice day.""

*edit*

I have many stories from this call center where I was there for only 6 months with this being one of the NICER incidents.  I had to deal with calls (because I was a floorwalker, I got to take supervisor calls) where customers threatened to rape the female tech.  Calls where they threatened to bomb the call center.  Calls where they refused to talk to a woman tech because Islam forbade it (no joke, this happened 6 times that I counted).  Even had an incident one day where a hobo walked in and urinated all over the call center floor.


I also have many stories from another tech support job for a local dial-up company (before it went out of business) (mostly about country bumpkins, so they are more funny from the strange things country folk do/say).","Go ahead and do that, sir....",166
gernderg,24,18,1nj43y,79,"I work as tech support for an elementary school. My job duties cover everything from basic computer support to bringing in children from recess. I've been doing tech support in various fields for quite a while now, and I pride myself on being extremely patient and genuinely feeling there's no such thing as a dumb question.  You can ask me for support on anything, including how to click a mouse, and I will do it with a smile and without making you feel stupid.

However, over the last two days, I have found that even I have limits.

We have a teacher who has been absent for two days, and he has a sub. Now this is a normal thing in a school for obvious reasons, and subs often need special help with their classrooms as they are in an unfamiliar location and often overwhelmed by students they don't know. I try to make a special point of checking up with any substitute we have first thing in the morning. This substitute, however, greeted me with four voicemails as I walked in the door.

""Hello, this is &lt;name&gt; and I am a substitute for &lt;music teacher&gt;. Could you come down to room 14 and help me with my computer this morning? If possible I would appreciate it if you walked me through the first few classes.""

This voicemail was repeated another three times with similar wording. I'm feeling wary of her, and I certainly don't have the time to dedicate to her for three hours, but I go down because it's my job. She's probably not very familiar with using computers (though she needs to use one to get a sub position in this district!). I arrive in the room and she has a whole list of questions to ask me. This list is her entire sub plan given to her by the regular teacher. Some teachers make horrible sub plans, but this one was good. It included directory paths to all the powerpoint presentations, it included labels on every CD she needed to play. Even the CD player was labeled with bright pink and orange sticky notes pointing to the play button and the input select button. The VCR had these as well.

At this point, I'm still hopeful she's just not confident and needs someone to confirm with her that the classroom is set up the way the sub plan says it is. I walk her through everything with a warning that I have to get back to another room to help with some students, and I can't put that off. She says that's fine, but then proceeds to have me reset everything to the way it was and have her try it, with me confirming every step... including confirming that you open a file by double clicking (""You see, that's good to know! That's why I called you down here!"")

I'm getting to be late for the class I have to work with at this point, and she still has over 3/4 of her lesson plan to go through. I tell her I have to leave but she can call my office if she needs anything. (Why must I have good customer service? WHY?) I head off to help with the students... and return to my desk 10 minutes later with three voicemails.

""Hello, this is &lt;name&gt; and I am a substitute for &lt;music teacher&gt;. I'm trying to play a CD and I need to know if I press the play button on the CD player to make it go.""

I can't believe what I'm hearing. I understand some people are hesitant around technology. Many think that it's easier to break things than it really is... but this takes it to a whole new extreme. I call back, and confirm that you do indeed press play to start the CD. I'm beginning to think that this may not be the end to the calls. My fears were soon confirmed.

Now, because you may be getting the general idea at this point, I'm going to summarize the rest of the day... I received 37 calls from this sub, all starting with:

""Hello, this is &lt;name&gt; and I am a substitute for &lt;music teacher&gt;.""

All of them were the following simple questions... asked every time she needed to do something:

* Pressing play on the CD player or VCR
* Switching inputs on the projector
* Advancing a slide in powerpoint
* Opening a powerpoint file (including ""is this the file I open?"")
* Whether she uses the white thing or the black thing (the projector remote or the mouse)

I was called to confirm every tiny thing she did with anything plugged into electricity throughout the day. At first I naively tried teaching her how to use things... but as the day progressed, I gave up... realizing this was a sub and she'd be gone in a day or two, I left a remote window up on my machine and would open files as she needed, only having to explain anything when she had to start a CD.

To top this story off... she was back again the next day, and we're going through the same routine. I also learned she called the office 5 times to ask for directions to the school (it's not hard to find), and she bugged all the staff around her to help her through the day.

I never have said this before, but I have come across a truly stupid user.",I have found the stupidest of users,97
mdsnbelle,9,15,1nizyc,66,"It's not that my users are lying to me.  It's that they're so goddammned bad at it.

As with any school system, ours has a series of academic requirements that must be met in order to graduate from high school.  Some classes can be taken multiple times for credits (for instance, I took 4 years of band and they all counted), while others can only be taken once with the last instance counting.  If a student takes a class, gets a D and then takes it again and fails, the F counts.  

*It's confusing, just go with it* 

This morning, I was asked to review a record for a student who was coming up funky on the report that deems whether or not a student is ready to graduate.  I did, and as I always do,  when I was done with the fix, I checked the transcript against the grad-check to make sure that everything lined up and I didn't break anything else.  When I did, I discovered that the first instance of an unrepeatable class was changed from an F to a D.  

Couple things struck me as weird:

* The course in question was three years old
* The course originated in the county, but not at at the school the student is currently attending.
* The only record in the student's entire course history that did not have my UserId (I'm the default) is this course.  It belongs to someone at the current school.

Remember how I said that the course originated within the system?  Yeah, that means archives.  I checked those too, all the way back to the original grade given by the original teacher.  As I expected, it was an E.  An E that stayed that way for three years until someone at the new school had an **oh shit!** moment and realized that this kid never technically passed the course in question.

Which means, come June, they're SOL.

I checked.  I rechecked.  No matter how I sliced it, it smacked of a conspiracy.  This particular school is somewhat notorious for doing underhanded things, we've never just outright caught them so obviously before.

Satisfied (and a little gleeful) that I had all my ducks in a row, I laid it all out for my boss.  He's taking it up the chain, but we decided to give the school one more chance to come clean.  I emailed the user and let her know that the original issue she emailed about was fixed and that it looked like the only remaining graduation requirement was this course.

She came back with:

*Oh, I know.  Stupid me.  They passed it at [School 1] with a D, and I scheduled them in [Current School] anyway.  I know that technically the last grade stands, but we're going to make an exception since it was my fault for scheduling them in a class they already passed.*

She doesn't know about the archives.  Or that the assistant superintendent is coming for her for the lies.

**tl;dr:** User tries to rewrite history.  Forgot/didn't know about the archives that show exactly what happened.

**And before the obvious question comes:**  There is still time for the student to make up the class before graduation.  Or there will be if the counseling staff stops trying to cover their own asses.

AngelOfLight,42,28,1niqiw,163,"Not completely tech support related, but I always found this story funny.

Many years ago I contracted with a large mortgage company to do a modernization - mostly converting ISAM files into a relational database, and upgrading a bunch of COBOL reports to Crystal. One of these reports was a commission calculation - basically a COBOL routine that runs through new loans and determines how much each loan officer should be paid.

I get the requirements from the manager of the loan origination office - nothing too complex. I write up the Crystal report and compare it to the old COBOL printout. It doesn't match. I'm more or less close, but I still get consistently higher values. I check the requirements again - nope, I have it correct. Check that the ISAM files have been correctly converted - again, all looks correct.

So finally I ask the mainframe guys for a copy of the COBOL routine. Yup - you guessed it. The program has a loop initialization bug. My Crystal report is correct - the original commission calculation is not. For years now, they have been underpaying their loan officers.

Of course, now I have no idea what to do. I decided to speak with the manager. I show him the two reports, with the COBOL bug highlighted. There is a long silence while he compares the two. Finally, he looks up at me with panic in his eyes. ""Can you fix it?"" 

""It's already fixed - the Crystal report is right.""

""No...can you make the Crystal report look like the COBOL printout?""

""I...what? You want me to introduce a deliberate bug into my report?""

""Not a bug...an adjustment.""

I think about this for a while.

""No. Someone else will eventually figure out that this report is wrong, and if there are any legal issues, I don't want to be involved.""

Me: OK step one is to click down here and connect to your wireless.

Her: But I don't have internet at home!

Me: What do you mean? You don't have wireless? Because I can give you a cable if you need.

Her: No I don't have internet!

Me: You must have internet! How have you been connecting to the VPN all this time?

Her: I don't know I just connect to the VPN. That means I'm using your internet right?

Me: Huh? No you must have an internet connection first in order to connect to the VPN. (At this point I am flustered and don't know how to explain to her that the VPN connection doesn't just come out of thin air without sounding rude).

Me: Well you can use the hotspot in your cell phone if you need to, or any public wi-fi access point.

Her: Well my son uses ""guest wireless."" Maybe I could use that?

Me: Sounds like your neighbors left their wireless unsecured, but sure that could work as long as the signal is strong enough.

********

The setting: Four score and seven years ago ….err maybe just five actually. This tale begins in 2008. I had just finished my occupational training in the military and was taking my place amongst the enlisted ranks in my first unit. 

During the check in process for the unit, I was assigned to the company that was getting ready to deploy in a couple months. There was a lot of training going on and I was coming in right in the middle of it. I also received my assignment within the company: I was going to be part of the Server Team.

Now I may have been a little overly excited about this. I had just completed a year of training (including boot camp, combat training, and MOS school) and I was ready to put my knowledge to the test. I had mixed feelings about going on deployment, but this is what I had signed up for. (Yeah I specifically joined the military to play on computers. Don’t judge me.)

For the most part, new joins to a unit are not actually greeted that fondly. In fact generally new joins are referred to as “boots” until the boot camp brainwashing has worn off. They can be obnoxious and annoying and nobody really wants to deal with the guy that is so afraid to move an inch that they ask for permission to walk. Well, I was about as boot as they came.

Being on the Server Team was a highly coveted position. Everybody wanted to get their chance to play with the “cool stuff”, mostly because help desk and LAN are a bore fest. Here I was, a fresh boot getting a prime spot, while others had been waiting a year or more hoping against hope that they could be where I was so unceremoniously thrown. (And I later found out why, but that is a story for another day)

So there I was, first day on the job. I had come in during the middle of a training evolution, and everything was running pretty smoothly. Sure, there was a minor hiccup here and there, but nothing critical. I was ready to start doing cool shit.

Wait, not so fast! As the most junior member of the team (and the lowest ranking) I was going to be doing the tasks no one else wanted to do. This pretty much consisted of server health checks. 

There were about 30 servers that we were working with and the health checks I was supposed to be running was an Excel spreadsheet-made-checklist that was about a mile long. Going through each of the servers and doing the checks manually took about six hours, and incidentally, the checks had to be run every six hours. So every day, I was supposed to spend my entire shift running health checks.

Well after about the first five minutes doing this, it was getting pretty old. After an hour, I think the sight of the poorly formatted excel sheet was making me physically ill. But, being in the military, it puts the lotion on its skin, and it doesn't ask questions.

By day three, I had figured out that I could actually create my own custom MMC from which I could gather over half of the information. This cut down the time it took to do server checks by about half. But I was not content. I did the checks and in the free time that was left over I researched how I could make things better. 

Network monitoring software, the obvious solution, was out of the question. There was no way they were going to make purchase like that for a training evolution. So I decided to try my hand at a little scripting. I was pretty new to the concept, but I had a little programming background from for dummies books. That and my knowledge of the Great G got me through.

Excitedly, every step of the way, I was letting my middle supervisor (let’s call him Cpl Elvis) know what I was doing. He seemed to appreciate the enthusiasm, and really didn’t have a problem with me spending the time on the project so long as the server checks were also getting done and he could watch whatever movies he had brought into the office that day (your tax-dollars at work!).

After about three weeks, juggling the scripting with the server checks, cleaning the bathroom, and insert-random-tasks-here, I managed to come up with a pretty functional script. I was happy with the results. It didn’t create a fancy web page, or auto-fill the Excel sheet, but I could run the script, review the output and fill out the Excel sheet in about 20 minutes.

Being proud of my accomplishment, I presented the script to Cpl Elvis, and showed him all that it could do in its infinite glory. He was particularly impressed and told me he was going to show what I did to the Server Chief (SSgt Tony).

So I go about doing my thing, basking in my own glory. I didn’t hear anything that day, and I wasn’t necessarily expecting to. It was what happened the next day that took me by surprise and showed me precisely the environment I would be working in for the next four years.

SSgt Tony came into the office for shift changeover that morning. This was a special occasion! He had an announcement to make.

“Good morning, my fine, young minions! I wanted to take a second to talk to you about the way we are doing server checks. It has come to my attention that Cpl Elvis has taken the time to write a script to gather information from the servers so that you can fill out an excel spreadsheet. *WHY THE F..K AREN’T YOU F..KERS USING THE NETWORK MONITORING SOFTWARE?! WE PAID OVER $10K FOR THAT S..T!*”

Needless to say, I was furious. I had spent three weeks on that script to 1) have Cpl Elvis take full credit for my hard work and dedication, and 2) find out that pretty much everything I had done was irrelevant. I couldn’t express my anger for fear of sounding disrespectful (a chargeable offence in the military), so my only option was to sit there and fume about it.

We broke from our meeting, and did our changeover. Nothing really important, as I recall. There usually was never anything important. It was then that SSgt Tony called over to me and asked for a word in private. This was a pretty bustling building mind you. Simulations were abound, and there was really no truly-private location. So naturally we went to the maintenance closet.

I found out at that time that SSgt Tony was actually a pretty cool guy. He had looked over the code of the script and seen immediately at the top “ ‘Created by PFC McSparklenuts”. Cpl Elvis hadn’t even bothered to write himself in there.

We talked for a bit. He was pretty impressed with what I had done being so fresh out of school (a school that is not known for its excellence in quality), and apparently Cpl Elvis had a history of taking credit for other people’s work. He explained that Cpl Elvis was a shining example of what not to be, and that he was only on the server team as a running joke amongst the section chiefs.

He gave me one piece of advice before we left that maintenance closet: Get even. Do whatever it takes, but don’t be disrespectful. And even, I did get, but that is a tale for the next installment.

BetaDemascenone,27,25,1ngkc6,128,"Hey all! First post here on TFTS...bear with me.

I work in IT for a rather large university, supporting all various areas of technology including networking, printing, audio/visual, etc. The best user error stories usually stem from students attempting to successfully use our printers. 

The best user error by far: 

Student approaches the help desk notifying us that the color printer isn't working correctly. As expected, I inspect the printer...no error message from printers, other people are able to print perfectly well. The student is clearly frustrated as she is insisting her document should be in color. When I follow the student to her computer and look at the document she is trying to print, its a regular Word document with black text and no graphics. She re-prints and asks ""Why isn't this coming out in color? I want my font in color"". I'm not quite sure what my explanation was at that point, the logic didn't quite make any sense.

I still don't understand the logic behind that. 

TL;DR: Student was trying to print black and white document on a color printer to make it pretty. ",Why yu no print color?!,153
ThePlat,5,16,1ngj0l,102,"Well here we go, finally done lurking and figure I might share a story for my first post.

So a few years back I got my first job in IT. I was hired on as a temp at a non-profit that offers vocational rehabilitation services, including a clerical training program, to adults who have lost their job for various reasons. I should note that at this point I had no formal IT training and simply used what I had learned from building and fixing my family's computers. Needless to say I extremely nervous that people would ask me overly complicated questions that would just make me look like an idiot. My job, at first, was to simply load an image on 70 new computers for the clerical classroom.

About two weeks in we were ready to deploy all the new machines. One of the full time guys and I went to the classroom and started on one row of computers so the students in the other rows could keep working. Out of the blue I had an older gentleman ask if I could take a look at his computer because it was ""possessed"" as he described it.

I walk over to the machine and just saw a plain normal desktop. I grabbed the mouse and tried to get into Control Panel but as soon as I opened the window it closed again. I clicked on other programs and they'd instantly shut down as well. I right clicked on the desktop and a new folder would spontaneously appear before I even saw the menu open. I was nervous, this was the first big problem I've run across and I'm standing in the front row of a room of about 35 people. As I go through all the possible things it could be I looked down and saw the student's workbook open on the desk. Finally I decided to try to restart the computer. As I reached for the power button I noticed something peculiar about the computer, there was no keyboard. After a moment it dawned on me. I picked the heavy workbook off the keyboard, placed it aside and the computer miraculously fixed itself. 

That was definitely the moment when I learned to approach a problem with a lowest common denominator mindset.",Makes me feel as clueless as the user.,118

pw3ner,260,332,1ng9i9,1255,"A little background, I work in a Hospital and I won't divulge which but it sometimes scares me how inept the people I trust to save my life are.  Many of our pieces of software are older and designed for XP as such newer versions of programs like java, flash, reader, etc. can cause compatibility issues so we keep the correct install files handy.

I get a call from a less critical area of the hospital where some of the less computer savvy nurses tend to be shuffled off too. Old Nurse O.N. and I begin the playful IT banter.

Me: ""Help desk this is [ME].""
ON: ""My (program) isn't working, java needs fixed.""

Here I think someone just updated Java to make their internet radio work or something and I just need to reinstall the old version. I remote on, see the old version and reinstall it.

ON: ""that's not going to make the program slow again is it? Every time you people put that on I have to wait for that stupid coffee cup and it makes my program so slow. It's unacceptable and needs to be fixed.""
ME: ""Umm, what? Show me what you mean.""
ON: takes control of the pc and proceeds to load a patient record, the java cup pops up and a loading bar appears as the program scans The Entire Hospital Database for the correct patient. ""See, see how slow that is."" 
ME: ""Yes I see but there's really nothing I can do, you just have to deal with it because that's the software we use.""
ON: ""This is unacceptable, I want Java off all of these pc's in this office.""
ME: ""But none of your software will work.""
ON: ""Yes it will I know what I'm talking about, I went to school to be a nurse.""
ME: ""OK the client is always right.""

I proceed to remove Java from every pc in the office and make a ticket in the system while emailing my boss (and hers) with the ticket information and explanation as too why all the pc's in their office no longer work.

She calls back less than 5 minutes later to complain that now all of the computers are broken and doesn't know why. My coworkers who received the call simply asked her ""Now do you understand why we need Java?""",15 seconds for Java is just too long,1587

gruntunit,67,53,1nfwm1,283,"I used to be a Phone Tech Support for a certain Internet Provider in the US. The department I was in specialized in certain types of Modem-Routers only. Let's call these our department the Two-Cable Dept. We handle checking on networks, sending out tech teams and doing over-the-phone troubleshooting for most issue...as long as you are using a Two-Cable Modem Router.

I wouldn't call myself extremely good but I can fix most issues over the phone. Got good customer satisfaction scores even though my handling time would give my Supervisor fits. I've been told that I've got enough patience in me that I can pass off as a saint.

Anyway, in comes a call from an old lady. Let's call her Oldbag.

Gruntunit: Thank you for calling &lt;beep&gt; Two-Cable Dept. How May I help you?

Oldbag: Switch my internet on!

Gruntunit: Sure I can help you on that. What kind of error message do you see?

Oldbag: It just says ""No Signal"" on the TV thing!

After asking her on what her setup was and stuff, I find out that she was using an LCD monitor which is the same model and brand I was using. Her Two-Cable modem-router was working fine too based on what she had described to me and the tests I ran on my end. On a hunch, I removed the video cable from my monitor and I got ""No Signal"". So it boils down to one of two things. Monitor not connected or the computer is switched off.

Gruntunit: Oldbag, you said that the monitor is switched on right? Are the cables on it connected to the computer securely?

OldBag: I've never touched them so they should be.

Gruntunit: Allright. Is your computer switched on? If it is, can you please power-cycle it, I mean switch off then back on until you see the Windows Startup screen on the monitor?

Oldbag: My computer is not the problem! You have to switch on the internet! I've got no signal!

Gruntunit: Your internet is switched on here. Its just that your computer might be switched off. Can you please try to switch it back on?

Oldbag: What do you mean its switched on? Your internet is NOT SWITCHED ON! IT SAYS HERE NO SIGNAL! How many times do I have to tell you that? Where is your supervisor!

I end up handling the call to a supervisor...who gets ranted at that she got no signal and that we need to turn on her internet immediately or she reports it to the Better Business Bureau.

I was was browsing the computer section of a big retailer known for khaki pants and blue polos. I was wearing jeans and a blue t-shirt. Easy mistake, anyone could have made it, I know. This guy walks up to me with a laptop in his hands. He didn't look like an unusual guy. Jeans and a t-shirt with some rock band logo on it.

&gt; Hey brah, could ya swap out my battery? I wanna switch to crystal.

This leaves me confused for several reasons. First of all, I don't work there. Second, Nerd Herd is right up front. Third, what the hell brand is crystal? And this, my friends, was my first mistake. Curiosity.

&gt; I'm sorry. Crystal? I don't know that brand.

&gt; Yah, ya know, crystals! Crystals give off, like, good energy, and computers give off bad energy. That's why I got sick. I wantcha to make my computer run on crystal energy, then I won't get sick.

&gt; I can't do that, man, but I'll tell you who can. You wanna call the people who made your computer. There's a tech support number for them, somewhere. Don't take no for an answer. They're hoarding all the crystal energy for themselves, and you know who that helps?

Techsupportvictim,105,399,1nf43i,1102,"Okay I just thought of this story. Still makes me laugh my ass off.

A few years ago there was a malware going around for the 'virus free' Fruit OS (yeah I know not all malware are viruses and they said PC virus fees,work with me here). It was parading under the name of a legit albeit basically useless utility software, among other names. 

So Monday morning meeting and we get instructions on now to remove this bit of nasty from users computers and that a security update to block it had just been issued. Well timed cause not an hour later a very nice middle class mum type comes in with a laptop. 

The laptop was her daughters. A hand me down from Dad who just got a new one for his office. Since she's 14 she had been given permission to keep it in her room rather than half to use it in the family room like the younger kids. So Sunday afternoon she's working on homework or such in her room, come flying into the family room in tears. Babbling at her parents that she didn't do it, she didn't know what happened, she can't turn it out. She's wigging max here. Clearly thinks her parents are going to blame her, take away the computer, make her leave the cheerleading squad, put her in a nunnery etc. 

Mom calms her down, goes with her into the bedroom. Laptop lid is down. Mom is like 'show me what happened' thinking the computer crashed and won't start up or something. The daughter won't open it. She's freaking again. She didn't do it, it's disgusting etc etc.

Mom opens the computer and in the middle of the screen is this extreme close up. Gallon sized beans and frank. She tries to close the window and another pops up. And more and more. You name it, they got it. Then in the middle of all of this a window saying they had been infected with a virus and wanting a credit card to update their antivirus subscription.

At this point my only question was did Mom enter it. No. It seemed wrong. Thank the stars a computer user with sense. She had shut down computer and left it like that. 

Now in those days the system didn't auto reopen apps when you log in so I was safe to turn it on. Which index search found the files. Zap them, download the security update. Done in like 2 minutes. Explained to her what was going on and she said she was going to spread the word to her friends to download update etc.

As she's packing up the laptop to leave I couldn't help commenting that there was some good that came out of this. She knew she wasn't going to be a grandmother any time soon -- her daughter is freaked out by the site of naked guys. She laughed so hard she started crying.

Now this computer was under our extended warranty so both fixes are free. Can do it that night and get it back to him in the morning. He's acting all cool. 

Then I notice that his name is not the one registered as the owner. He tells me that he's the woman's personal assistant and could I just call him. Sure no problem. I add a note with his name etc. But something just doesn't seem right.

About five minutes later my 'bar' partner finishes his appointment and no one is waiting. Comes over to me and comments that he's seen this guy in 'all the time'. Just for fits we search the guys phone number and there are like 200 computers and, no joke, 500 phones and tablets under this guys name. We screen shot the list to look further. 

A bunch of the phones had inspection notes that they had been tampered with (overcharge the power connector and wait for it to die type games) and other stuff. We run a couple of emails we found on some of the records and found even more. We report what we found to our store manager who called our district manager etc. 

Now on one of the records we found a different phone number and for kicks called it. It rang to ""Dude Bros Repair Service"". We play the dumb owner and ask if he repairs (our brand computer) and yes he's certified as a warranty repair shop blah blah. Oh thank goodness says we. What's the address. And will he be there. Yes he's the owner.

We fix the computer during this time. Our district manager has contacted someone at Corp who verified that no this guy and his company are not listed. We get approval to skip his note and call the owner who was none too happy to find out that his guy lied that he was approved to do repairs, lied about her warranty status and was going to charge her almost four times as much claiming she needed a new hard drive, logic board, offering to move her data over etc. She came and got her computer, left her name if our lawyers need it and said she was going to context the Better Biz etc. 

He's been banned from our stores (even to buy stuff) reported to the state etc.

wtfisdisreal,45,40,1nev0r,154,"So pretty much as the title says, my mom tried to open a zip file using internet explorer as the default program. 

A little backstory: Earlier today I showed my mom how to use Google Drive on her phone to upload all her pictures to the cloud and open them on the desktop site. She had taken a bunch of pictures at a restaurant my parents had gone to yesterday with their friends and wanted share them with said friends, so I showed her how to do so with drive and she shared the pics, typical mother son tech support moment. I left her to her business, last I saw her everything was swell and her windows vista desktop was running fine. Or so I thought.

Apparently the friend she shared the pics with was even more technologically illiterate and signing into google was beyond her (she used a yahoo email but also had a google plus account meaning she could use drive), so she asked my mom to send the pictures as an attachment in an actual email instead of sharing via google. Cue my mom downloading her entire drive library. 

Now the thing with drive is that with big downloads like this it bundles everything into a zip for easier downloading. And apparently my mom had gone 4 years with this computer without ever having to download and extract from a zip file. So she innocently downloads the zip, but her computer didn't have winrar or anything of the sort so it defaulted to windows image viewer or whatever the fuck its called. I guess she tried that a few times before getting frustrated and finding the ""open with"" window. And out of all the possible programs she could have chosen, she went with Internet Explorer. The web browser. She doesn't even use IE (I downloaded firefox for her and she's been using that for a few years), so I have no idea why she would choose that, but she did. 

It was a mess. She calls me over in in near tears, saying that ""google drive killed my computer"". I go over to see what could possibly have gone wrong and I'm just dumbfounded by what I see. Windows explorer is repeatedly crashing and restarting. A few hundred IE windows are open, constantly closing and restarting also, I'm guessing the computer got stuck in a loop and took a shit on itself. If computers could talk, it would have been screeching nonsense while slobbering all over itself, unable to process the massive degree of stupidity of the task it had been asked to perform. I'm not gonna claim to be some computer expert either, I'm just some fucking guy. So if anyone here knows why the computer had this reaction to trying to open a zip file with IE please feel free to explain.

Anyways, after a quick ""wtf is happening"" moment (I didn't know what was going on at this point yet) I come to me senses and just ctrl+alt+delete the fuck out and reboot the computer. Once it restarts I ask my mom to show me exactly what happened and eventually get to the zip file, with IE as the default program to open it. I asked my mom if she had used zip files before and she swore she had, so I look for winrar to open the zip with but obviously I don't find it. I guess my mom is just a wizard who opened zip files without any program known to man. Long story short I download winrar and its all good now, she got the pictures out and life goes on.

As everyone should know, the tech support standard to fix things is to [unplug something and plug it back in](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85xwZ_OLX0). Luckily, we had a way of rebooting cable modems remotely, which worked most of the time. This was one of the times when it didn't work.  
I asked the guy to reboot his modem, and he said he could not access it. It turns out that during recent renovations of their living room, they decided to seal the modem into the wall, since they never have to do anything with it anyway. They ran the network cable out a hole in the wall.  
At this point, he was left with three options:  
* Flip the breaker for whatever is giving that modem power, and hope it turns back on  
* Purchase a new modem, have the account changed for it, and deal with an electronic device in the wall that has no ventilation and is powered on  
* Break open the wall, reboot the modem, redo the drywall

However she was having none of it.

I'm not entirely sure what was going on inside her skull but she thought the simple act of inserting my usb would mess up her files and or delete them or something(I expressed to her that my usb had no viruses, nor was corrupt). I honestly don't know. I explained that it wouldn't do that, that i would simply copy the file and her file order would stay intact. Nor would her files get deleted.

One day I was working on detective's PC trying to get a piece of software to work correctly.  I was beating my head against a wall trying to fix this 1990's crapplication so I got up and took a walk.

I was told that I could not leave the detectives office door open when I left, so I walked up and down the hallway a few times within sight of the door waiting for the urge to shoot the PC to pass.

When I finally calmed down, I walked back into the office and noticed a plant sitting on the desk right by the door.  The poor plant is obviously dying and is wilted over so I grab my bottle of water and walk back over to it.

At this point, I take a longer look at the plant right before I dump the water in and realize that I'm actually looking at a pot plant!  There is a small, wilted pot plant just sitting on this detective’s desk and I almost just watered it! It even had an evidence sticker on the side of the planter identifying it as a ""Marijuana Plant"".

I take a few pictures of it and email them to coworkers and get back to finishing up the PC.

I'm not in in tech support, although always having an interest in computers I'm your typical family tech support. My duties normally include reminding my mum how to copy &amp; paste every few days, and cleaning up my brother-in-laws laptops every few months (usually just toolbars and unwanted programs, the kind of guy that agrees to every additional program, I swear he's afraid of offending someone if he selects no). Today I was assigned a new project: fixing my neighbours laptop. We'll call her **F**riendly **N**eighbour.

**Mum**: Hey Divine, can you take a look at **FNs** laptop? Her antivirus popped up with something this morning and she's scared of pressing anything.

*She has the same antivirus as me since she asked for a good one to use. Mine popped up for an update the previous night so figured it was this*

**Me**: It'll just be an update, tell her she's fine to do it. Mine did the same.

**Mum**: Can you take a look anyway? You know what she's like.

Sigh. Take a look, everything's fine. Check when it was last updated and sure enough it was dated that morning. I hop over the wall to drop if off, explain that it just needed updating which she did successfully, all with a friendly smile letting her know she did good. Instead the opposite happens, she becomes distraught that she's broken the laptop her son bought her 6 months prior.

**FN**: How can I have updated it?! I have no idea how to make a program!

After a few attempts of explaining she doesn't actually have to do anything, my customer service kicks in (I work in retail) and I agree to show her how to run a virus scan and prove everything is fine. Reflecting on our previous conversation, I'm surprised the laptop seemed to run fine when I looked at it at my house, considering it's had 6 months with someone who thinks they need to rewrite a program to update it. The scan proved otherwise.

Just basically full of your normal stuff: toolbars, useless programs and strangely multiple (I'm talking 10-15) copies of the same documents. I'm guessing she isn't aware that it gets saved and redownloads them everytime she wants them. I show her the scans gone fine, explain that I'm late for work and head off.

Got to work 10 minutes late, apologise and agree to stay late and everything's fine. The surprise came when I got home.

On my table was a 4 pack of John Smiths, with a note thanking me and apologising for making me late for work. Bless her heart. I think I'll go round tomorrow and clean her laptop up ""free of charge"" this time and show her some basic stuff.",Free beer is always nice,207

Anyhow, I punch in for my shift and as I'm walking out to the floor I see two of my co-workers attempting to get a document to print. The printer was having none of it and decided that it didn't want to print of the cardstock that the job required. I asked if I may have a go at fixing the issue and they oblidged me. I tried changing the print settings (landscape, paper feed source, etc.) and nothing was working. Then I remembered something importaint... I never turned it off and on again.

In order to build the new lab, they are temporarily re-locating all of the project infrastructure servers.  As you would expect, this involves an advertized unavailability period while we walk the servers down the hall and have the telcom guy (a contractor) activate the network connection ports.

If you've ever done an unavailability like this, you are probably thinking that I'm going to complain about a user that missed the memo and doesn't want us to shut down the servers... not this time.

The advertized unavailability was set for 1400 (2pm) on Friday.  Expecting a rough afternoon, my self, the project lead and my boss decided to go out to lunch a little after 1200.  On the way out the door, a junior sysadmin stopped us:

Sysadmin: ""The telcom guy wants to do the move at 1245."" (it's 1215)

Project Lead: ""No.""

Sysadmin: ""He said that he was planning at leaving by 1100 originally.  We are 'lucky' he's willing to stick around until then.""

Project Lead: ""No.  Even if we would entertain the thought of moving early, now is too late.  Everyone is at lunch; they won't know until 1 at the earliest.  1245 is NOT gonna happen.""

Sysadmin: ""He said that he won't stick around until 2.  He has somewhere else that he needs to be.""

Me: ""So?  1400 was the advertized time.  Hand cuff yourself to the telcom closet if you need to; don't let him touch it before then.""

Sysadmin: ""But I think he's going to leave.""

Project lead: ""Then hand cuff yourself to him.""

Me: ""...or lie down behind his truck...""

Sysadmin: ""I could slash his tires!""

Boss: ""lol... &lt;manager voice&gt; No. &lt;/manager voice&gt; Do what you need to do, but this move will happen at 2 on the dot.  We're going to lunch.""

I never did find out what the junior sysadmin did and, frankly, I'm not going to ask.  All I do know is that when we got back from lunch, the telcom guy was still there, the servers were still hooked up and the development team was preparing for the unavailability as planned.  The plan went off at 1400 without a hiccup.",Advertized unavailability time is NOT negotiable,914
dalgeek,11,15,1narao,97,"It's human nature.  When people don't understand something, they blame it for whatever is going wrong so they aren't responsible for fixing the problem.  We all know users do this, but IT folks can be just as guilty.

Back in 2006 I was an independent consultant doing odd jobs here and there. One night I get an IM from a former coworker ""Hey, you know spamassassin?  I have a quick $2k for you"".  Interest piqued, I ask what's going on: friend of a friend works for a company and they're having mail issues.  ""Attachments aren't getting through, we think it's the Linux server that does spam filtering, it's stripping attachments"" is the description from the customer.  I figure it'll be something stupid (and therefore a quick buck) so I agreed to take the case.

I call the customer and .. holy shit.  I find out that they fired the entire IT department 2-3 weeks prior.  The new sysadmin has been on the job for literally 3 days and has a very weak grasp on mail systems in general, let alone Exchange.  They are heavily dependent on an outsourced IT firm for their network and major application support -- however, it takes their outsourced IT guy over 2 hours to get me VPN access to the Linux server just so I can take a look.  I ended up telling him to just map port 22 through the firewall so I could SSH in.

There is a Linux server running SpamAssassin which relays the mail to an Exchange 2003 server.  I check the logs and don't find anything unusual so I send a few test messages to monitor the progress through the system.  Everything looks good on the Linux server, but the user claims they get no attachment .. odd, the logs show that the attachment was scanned and forwarded.  This is where I discover that the customer can't tell the difference between ""there is no attachment"" and ""there is an attachment but I can't open it"". *facepalm*

I spend the next 2 hours doing debug traces and packet captures on the Linux server just to prove to them that the messages are leaving the server fully intact.  While I'm doing this I run across an MSKB article regarding a bug that corrupts mail attachments when they are transferred from SMTP to MAPI.  At this point I inquire about the Exchange server and find out that it hasn't been patched in well over 6 months, so it's missing the hotfix for this particular bug.

Of course installing the patch requires a reboot of the Exchange server.  Whoever installed Exchange had no clue what they were doing, so there was only one server and the entire company was in a single 18GB mail store, meaning a reboot could take 30+ minutes.  The COO deemed that unacceptable during business hours, even though their email is essentially useless since nearly all of the messages they receive have attachments.  Whatever, I'll sit on my hands for 2 hours and get paid for it.

Sure enough, the 6 month old hot fix corrects the problem and mail attachments work again.  I make sure I upgrade the Linux server to the latest and greatest and tell them they need to schedule time to install the rest of the updates on the Exchange server.  Overall they lost nearly a day of productivity and paid a consultant almost $2000 for something that could have been fixed in 15 minutes with a Google search and a reasonably competent sysadmin.

When we last left off, I'd just turned in my two weeks' notice, and was working with my minion to update Kronos clocks throughout the domain of my employer.

We drove from site to site, splitting up to handle the remote locations. I took the liberty of sending him to the remote locations, knowing he was hurting for cash, so he'd get quite a chunk of change from the mileage, whereas I took the locations I'd been to for various projects, knowing that the people I'd worked with would welcome me once more into their offices.

Sure enough, I was right. The community clinics where I visited welcomed me with open arms; the hospital staff recognized me and greeted me. The private clinics - the cardiologists, the family practices, the psychiatrists - they let me take advantage of them once more, up to and including what the drug vendors brought (in one case, the cardiologists had a rep come in with a full barista setup as well as a pancake grill. I ate well that morning - strawberry crepes, a twelve-shot giant coffee, and a plate of fruit and eggs).

All too soon, the clocks were done, and there were two days left on my tenure with the hospital chain.

The second to last day was spent cleaning out [my cubicle](http://imgur.com/a/tf2k5#3); cleaning it out was a chore and a half. All the cabling was a nightmare to undo; the gear had to be returned to the projects where all my stuff came from.

On a side note, it's amazing what extra you can budget for when you control the quotes for projects.

After removing my [huge-ass Intergraph 21sd95](http://imgur.com/a/tf2k5#1) from my cube (whence it had been used as a foot-warming ottoman in winter, albeit with a resolution of 2048x1536), I knew the time had come. The end of the week came nigh, and I was to leave the end of the next day - Friday afternoon.

I knew the procedure for the techs - reimage the laptop, redeploy to the next employee, et cetera.

Sure enough, the tech approached me and asked me what I was going to do with my machine. ""Hey, uh, since you're IS, I can do you a favor, if you like. I know your queue is busy as hell. You mind if I just drop the laptop on your desk at the end of the day tomorrow?"" He nodded assent, and the second-to-last phase of my plan was put into motion.

I took the last day to say goodbye and hand off all my documentation about active projects (what precious little I hadn't logged in the first place) to /u/krynnyth, and at 2 PM, I hooked my laptop up to the imaging switch by the head of desktop's cube. I PXE-booted to the SCCM boot environment, selected the task sequence that would reimage Windows 7 32-bit to my laptop, and tapped Enter to start it, then walked off for a cup of coffee.

An hour and a half later, while it was imaging, various coworkers were stopping by my desk to say goodbye. One of them, a good friend, asked ""What's going to happen to the scripts?""

I smirked and replied, ""Not my problem any more, and I'd love to see him actually try to code on his own.""

About twenty minutes later, sounds of anguish came from two aisles over, as the network admin whose cube had been next to mine prior wept tears of anguish that his OS install on his encrypted laptop had failed - and he thought he lost all his data and configs. 

As luck would have it, I had the only copy of the enhanced Symantec Endpoint Encryption WinPE environment that I'd made - the only one that still functioned, anyways; the time lock on the others that I'd given out had kicked in six months ago, after the project managers and Derp higher-ups had rejected it despite my proposals - and booted it off one of my USB keys, saving his data and keeping him happy.

""Jack... does ANYONE else have this tool?""

""Nope. They rejected it? They don't get it.""

""Their loss. Enjoy the new place, keep in touch.""

The day ended, and my former PFY came by my cube. I accepted his farewells with cordial pleasantries, and I walked him to the end of the row of cubes.

""Oh, Jack, you know your Latitude E5320, your laptop, right? It's supposed to go to me as an upgrade instead of my 6400. Where is it?""

I knew he wanted the data on it, all the juicy things he thought I was working on, script revisions, tools, my e-mail archives, updates, all manner of good things - which I had removed ages ago and resolved not to work on at all. Sure enough, the look on his face betrayed him, and I put him off a bit.

I tapped my chin for a few seconds before the smile on my face turned into a smirk. He asked me again, and I couldn't resist. I gestured with my arm in an expansive sweep towards the imaging bench, on which rested ten laptops - nine of which were E6400s, and my E5320 was the odd man out.

""One of these things is not like the others...""

His face whitened.

""What? You know I'm following SOP. All assets are to be reimaged before they're redeployed to other employees. You know the data migration process, yes? You can use the Windows Easy Transfer tool or SCCM to migrate your data from your laptop to this freshly imaged E5320. You should enjoy it, it's freshly reimaged, clean, and speedy enough.""

After a brief transition period through the five stages of grief, he settled back on anger, and stormed off. I returned to my cube, phone in hand, playing a game of Plague Inc. and slaughtering the world with the Neurax Worm.

The reimage finished, and I locked the laptop to the bench using a lock that only I had the master key for. I then dropped my badge on my boss's boss's boss's desk, went through my desk one more time to ensure that I hadn't left anything behind, and dropped my keyring full of computer lock keys on my boss's desk.

In the heat of the Texas sun, I walked out, the light flashing off the building, a sense of freedom pulsing through me as I walked the less-than-a-block to my apartment from the office.

When I arrived home, I opened a celebratory bottle of Glenlivet 18, took a slug, and sat down in my huge comfy chair.

And yet, the best was still to come.

Neue_Ziel,19,35,1nal19,159,"Today I bring to you another tale of my Naval adventures in Nuclear IT.


So we have a server space, with 2 cabinets containing 6 servers and a radio communications control panel for those working in the plant to be able to talk to each other. This room has it's own air conditioning, and I remember fondly of being in 100+ degree weather and hopping in this room, of which I and my coworkers had the only 4 keys, to enjoy the 60 degree air. This air conditioner is important, as we shall see...


Neue_Ziel: RIM room, NZ.

Electrician: Hey, are you doing something to the network?

NZ: No, why?

E: Because I can't access my files...

NZ: Okay, let me see....


To my horror, the network is down, and I ping the server that would cause the issue, seeing no reply. I get another call:

NZ: RIM Room, NZ.

Mechanic: (program used for maintenance tracking and safety) is down, and Mechanic 2 says it is doing the same thing for him


A creeping feeling of dread is overcoming me. The user files are on one server and the maintenance program files are on another. I ping the servers, and on a hunch, ping the others in the air conditioned room......no response.

I yell at the one of the guys I work with to come with me and we take off to the server room. Opening the door, we are greeted to temperature alarms and being blasted in the face with very hot air. Using an infrared thermometer, I get 140 degrees on a metal surface. 

The air conditioner is off, and resetting the breaker on it does nothing. Using the labelplate on the unit, I am able to locate the feeder panel the A/C unit is on, and find it and all other breakers on it are tagged out. No power, no cool air, causing the servers to shut down on overtemperature conditions at 110F. 


I run over to ask what the hell the electricians are doing, and find them taking their sweet time fixing something, and letting the officer in charge of the plant know that their maintenance has taken out the network, and without the network, no one is getting anything done. I see the look of panic in his eyes, and he makes an announcement over the 1MC for the electricians to come. They come in and he says:


Officer: Hurry up and finish your work, NZ says you took out the network.


As mentioned in my other stories, this network is vital for the work, used by lowly third classes up to captains, and no one wants to be the  one that brings down the wrath of our department head.

They got power back on, got the A/C on again, and I found that they had failed 2 1 TB hard drives, not bad, but what a pain.

So I was working with a client that was having issues with the time going out of sync on all the windows machines on the domain. They would start to run slow even after the time was adjusted on the server. Right off the bat their IT guy is telling me it's the server batteries. At first I thought he was talking about the UPS but I quickly realized that he was talking about the CMOS battery on the server. First off the server was less than a year old  and second I already had the problem figured out.

Basically they had one physical server but multiple virtual machines in hyper-v. One of the virtual machines was using one of the other virtual machines to sync its time, then that machine was syncing with another vm and then that vm was syncing with the physical machine, but then that physical machine was syncing with one of the VMs. Basically it was a big mess and all the servers were trying to get the time from each other. The servers were all having issues with the time drifting because of the goofy setup.

So I untangle that mess and fix it. I send a report to the company IT guy. He writes back: ""Sounds good but I really think we need to change those cmos batteries, can you get us a quote to replace the batteries on all the servers, the physical and the VMs""

I'm in application support. I was tasked as the project manager for migrating a couple of our old applications off of their old AS400/Sybase platform onto a virtual Windoze/Sql Server platform.

I got the first one done (only a little late) and started on the second one. I was told by my boss to to manage this one at ""arms length"". No need for me to spend all of my time on it. No, let others do the grunt work and I just keep things going. Well, things didn't go. I **had** to jump in to make things work.

I had several lusers doing UAT for over a month. They didn't report any problems and, in fact, said, ""Looks like we're good to go.""

Well, we went live Wednesday night (two months late). Thursday morning all hell broke loose. They were **NOT** ""good to go"". The shit continued to pile up into today. Finally, late this morning, I pull the plug. I admit that the migration has failed miserably and tell the DBA to revert.

That's when the bomb went off. Today was his last day. ***WTF?!?!?!?*** Why have I not heard about this until now? Worse, he tells me that management hadn't even told him who he was handing things off to. I pleaded with him to document all the issues before he left and he said he'd do that for me. (whew!) Ok, pick up the pieces next week and see what we can do to migrate successfully.

Meanwhile, an issue pops up with the previous application. One of the screens is just empty. Doesn't display what it's supposed to be displaying. I shoot an email off to our relationship manager (RM) asking, since i'm losing my DBA, who is handling server support for [application]?

This guy is Eastern European and sometimes his accent is a little difficult to understand, but he starts telling me about his awesome home computer with a 12 core processor and 32GB of RAM. He points me to the equipment and tells me that they have a machine that burns radiology images for patients to CDs, but the hard drive died and needed to be replaced. He tells me that he already swapped the drive and he has the recovery CD from the manufacturer but at one point it fails to run the repair. So we pop the CD in and I watch it go to the process. Sure enough, as soon as the program launches, it fails. He immediately shuts it off and asks me what I think, and mentions something about RAID. I tell him I want to read the error message some more, so he powers it up again and it goes through the process. Sure enough, the program is failing because its not recognizing a RAID configuration. I check the hard drives, and there are definitely two of them plugged in. He starts talking to me again and I just tune him out. I reboot the computer again, and go into the BIOS. Hey look, drive configuration options! I change it from ATA to RAID 0 and reboot. Of course the CD recognizes the drives and goes into recovery mode. I turn to my foreign friend, and he has this amazed look on his face. He then leans over to me and whispers (jokingly), *""Don't tell my boss, he might give you my job!""*",Whats that?

JL421,6,29,1n9rak,89,"I had a user whose laptop had a short in the power management circuit. No big deal, call Derp, get them to send out a tech to replace the motherboard.
For the mean time, I had an extra laptop of the same model, swapped the hard drive out, and gave her that as a replacement. All is well.

Fast forward two days, Derp comes installs the new motherboard, powers it on to make sure it works correctly. Everything's fine. (Except that the tech didn't listen to me when I said the boot option needed to be set to legacy, not UFEI, for these machines to boot properly. He screwed around for 30 minutes before I told him it was fine and to just leave, and I changed the boot option.)

I tell the user that I need to switch her hard drive back into her machine, and it should take less than 10 minutes. I take the machine back to my desk, replace the drive, boot it up, and everything is good. Bring it back to her desk, and put it on her dock and leave because she is still on break.

30 minutes later I get a call that she can't log in... Head down, she is trying to log into the local administrator account, not her domain account, still not a big de...Wait...why isn't there the option for domain login?

Log into the support account, it isn't joined to the domain. It isn't even named anymore. But all the user folders still exist.

The user then mentions, ""Ya, I started it up, but then I shut it off while the windows logo was on the screen because I wanted to move my dock. When I started it up it told me that I needed to repair the system.""

Our domain GP disables system restore, but doesn't delete previous restore points. Her system restored back 8 months to before it was ever joined to the domain, and any software was installed. **Sigh...**

User: ""Well I only did what the computer told me it needed to. Oh, I also got my review the other day, it said that I needed to work on my computer skills.""

ShotFromGuns,16,23,1n9lx8,158,"For the better part of a year, I've been ""temporarily supporting"" a fairly senior person in our organization (let's call her Penelope). Penelope is very sweet, and very good at what she does, but also deathly incompetent at anything involving things remotely technical. Which isn't to say that I don't think she'd be able to figure it out if she really had to; she's just one of those people who's never been forced to work with these systems, so when you try to throw her into them, she just gets flustered and shuts down... Which she can get away with, because she's highly placed enough that there are always people to do everything for her. To get delegation authority in a bunch of systems, I had to literally remote into her computer and do it for her; she couldn't even handle having me walk through the (very detailed, very explicit) instructions I'd sent her.

Not included in the original list of delegations was our IT request system, and Penelope is apparently the approver for hardware and software requests for a few people who report to her. Cue a string of back-and-forth emails every time there's a request...

So my coworker goes to troubleshoot an issue with a docking station, the laptop is not displaying to the screens. the coworker said the docking station is busted and needs to be replaced. We have never had a docking station fail, so it was highly unlikely he was correct. Most likely it was a human erorr, and he is a network guy that is an idiot with hardware.

I went down with a new docking station just in case though. Started normal troubleshooting, making sure monitor cables are plugged in. Undock the computer, then once I reseat the laptop in the docking station it all of a sudden works.....

What a surprise he never tested to see if the laptop was even seated properly.....

misterblp,45,48,1n9cb4,169,"Hi, just found this sub and wanted to share a story that almost broke the 'relationship' between me and my stepfather.

So, a couple of years ago, (2011 to be exact, and I wasn't studying IT yet) we went on a weekend trip with the 'family', but when we came back, I wanted to check my mail and schoolschedule for the next week, but I couldn't, because the internet was out.

Little backstory: my stepdad is a technician, and works with cables, air conditioners and such. oh, and he's as stubborn as a donkey who tries to get through a cacti field.

So, naturally, I told them internet was out. My stepdad told me;'Of course, did you even turn your computer off?'

 **me**; 'Yes, of course.' 

**Him:** 'Did you turn off the power switch?' 

**Me again:** 'Yes, of course and I even pulled the plug from the contact to be sure, why?'

 **Him:** : 'Did you unplug the Internet cable?' 

**Me:** 'No, I didn't, why?'

**Him:** 'Because your computer killed the router!' (exact words used)

I was seriously baffled.. the PC was off. The switch was set on OFF. THE PLUG WAS OUT. How could it DO something when it was OFF? 

**Me:** 'And how could it have done that?'

**Him:** 'Because, even when a computer is off, it stays in connection with the internet.'

**Me:** No, it doesn't. When a computer is off, it doesn't either SEND or RECEIVE datapackages!'

**Him**: Yes, it does.

**Me:** How do you even know! 

**Him:** I install internet cables as a living! I'm telling you, it does!

**Me:** No, it doesn't!

**Him:** Of course it does! First off, there's a battery in every computer to keep connection with the internet!

**Me:** No it doesn't, a computer has a battery to keep track of time, and that's it!

**Him:** Yes, and it needs to have a internet connection to do that!

I was so DONE with this by this point.

**Me:** It doesn't need a internet connection for that! it can do it independently, whether it's connected to the internet or not!

**Him ( getting pissed) :** YES IT NEEDS IT! GO ASK SOMEONE ELSE!

I was DONE with this discussion. I just went to the other side of the room, took the router, and unplugged the powerplug.

**Him (getting angry) :** WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

**Me:** I'm resetting it so we have internet again!

Then, he walks up to me, grabs the router, tried to find the cable, took an old cable my dad left there ( My parents divorced a year before that, it was in the house where my parents used to live in together. I don't where the cable was from, my dad works in IT and brings a lot of stuff home from work, pretty neat.), but it's current was too high. The Router died.

Then **he** told me: I was right! the router's dead! 

**Me:** Yes, of course it is! you plugged in the wrong one!

**him, looking at me in surprise:** What do you mean? 

I then show him the plug I just pulled from the router, which I still had in my hand. 

the next day when he got home from work, he had bought a new one, same model, I was amazed how he could find the same make AND model in such a short time. 

Sad part is, he still thinks my computer did it.

**TL;DR** Stepdad thinks my computer killed the router, goes ahead, plugs in a different plug my dad had left, and kills it.

And my all-time favorite, which really shows just how great of a tech he is: 

* ""I goofed up here. I don't know what the heck is going on here.""

**THINGS HE DOES WRONG**
To make these stories easier, I'll be referring to him as John.

1. He will not take a full lunch break. This has nothing to do with whether we are busy or not. There can be zero phone calls coming in, and he still will not take a full lunch break. Instead, he runs out to the nearest fast food place, gets his food, and then comes back and sits at his desk. Why is that a problem? Because the first time a call comes in, despite every other tech being available to take it, he will answer the call with his mouth full. I have personally witnessed him take a bite of his burger and then MAKE AN OUTGOING CALL while his mouth is still full. The customer picks up and has to deal with him saying ""Hurlgo, fis ish Jern fra sowah"" which roughly translated is ""hello, this is John from software"". Needless to say, nine times out of 10 the customer has no idea what he's saying. On top of this, he will continue to eat throughout the phone call, so the customer has to deal with his loud, open-mouthed chewing, his burping, and his attempts to talk with his mouth full. This happens every. damn. day. 

2. We have a 'rule' that you can only deal with one customer at a time. If we're very, very busy, then we can take one call, and one chat at a time, but we should never, ever be on more than one call at a time, for obvious reasons. John doesn't think this is a good rule. He has, on multiple occasions, called two, three people at once, remoted onto all of their computers and then 'got to work'. This has inevitably led to him performing the wrong fix on the wrong customer's computer, not noticing, and then calling to tell them ""you're all fixed up!"". Of course, the customer ends up calling back 5 minutes later because, not only is their original issue still there, but usually there's another issue that's cropped up from him doing the wrong thing. On top of this, because he's trying to juggle multiple customers at once, each call takes two or three times as long as it should. 
    - I've answered the call from the customer after John has screwed something up. The customer tells me ""I was just working with John for about an hour, and I'm not sure what he did. Nothing is fixed."" Now, standard protocol is if a customer was working with a tech on an issue, and still has that issue, we ask if they want to work with that tech again for continuity's sake. So I asked if he'd like me to transfer him back to John. His response: ""Oh god, no. Can you fix this? I really don't want to waste my time with him again. Is there anyone else?"" So of course I said yes, sure and fixed his issue after 15 minutes. Yes, I felt awesome.

They left me the box unopened and the install cd, so i quickly got to work. I got the parts of the printer put together but i didn't have time to finish the software install due to a soccer pre-season session, so I told my mom how far I got and that she should finish the rest. I come back home and she hasn't done anything since I left, no big deal though right? So I quickly got back to work and I'm doing my usual software install. I knew exactly what to install and what not to install to prevent unnecessary things from being downloaded/dumb hassles in the future. At this point my mom walks in and sees what I'm doing. 


**mom**: ""what the hell are you doing?""

**me**: ""installing your printer""

**mom**: ""well when it asks you, just click preferred""

**me**: ""no mom, that's the dumbest thing you can do"" (bad idea here)

**mom**: ""you have no fucking clue what you're doing! professionals wrote that software so just click preferred! you're just a 17 year old kid who doesn't know anything!""


At this point I'm arguing heavily with my mom over this issue, but eventually I just agree with her so she can leave and i can finish, which i do in less than 20 minutes. 

This kind of ignorance makes me so mad. She once blamed me for the internet being slow because ""I'm always on her computer"" (i have my own laptop) and when I went to look at her computer to figure out what was wrong, I found toolbars/malware galore. all because she clicks preferred on her usual software updates.

Dinodiva,3,20,1n7f52,48,"Greetings all,

It's been a week or two since my last post (which you can read [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1magsf/updating_is_so_weird/)), but today I will spin you a tale from yesterday afternoon.

This tale involves my very tech illiterate mother (my flair is a direct quote from her, if it helps to emphasize). I'm a freshman in high school, and I had been home for about an hour before my mom yells for me. This stifles a groan and an eye roll because I know what's coming next. We will define my mother as ""**TIM**"" or Tech Illiterate Mother.

**TIM**: Dinodiva!!! ... *DINODIVA!!!!*

**Me**: *(sighing)* What now?

**TIM**: I was working and then the laptop ""went poof"".

**Me**: Eh... poof? Define poof.

**TIM**: The screen. It went poof. Like three times I restarted it and it went poof.

I easily decipher that the laptop might be having power issues... I inspect the charging cord and it is connected. I restart the machine. The keyboard is not responding and I am unable to enter in the login password. Then, the laptop ""goes poof"" right before me. I decide to tear apart the machine. I arm myself with a few screwdrivers and set to work.

After getting all the screws out of the back casing, removing the speaker panel, and taking out the keyboard, I immediately notice that the ribbon cable connecting the trackpad to the motherboard is disconnected. Aha! While irrelevant to the current situation, I finally had found a solution as to why the trackpad was not working after I had previously taken the machine apart to clean it. It was my first time cleaning the machine as well, and didn't think anything of it.

Anyway, I spend at least TWO HOURS trying to get this cable reconnected. It was an arduous task. I didn't have enough room to work with, so I started removing every cable and connector so I could get some more room for my hands. Prying up the metal covering that the keyboard rests on was easier after that.

I find that this ribbon cable is bent to hell (not the pins, just the cable itself) and does not work very well in trying to push it into the connecting slot. The connector that resides under the trackpad comes loose. After some silent curses and brief hatred of ribbon cables, I finally get it back in. At least it *looked* like it was back in. I also manage to connect it to the motherboard. I look around the motherboard for any other discrepancies, and there doesn't seem to be anything else wrong. I reassemble the machine and boot it up.

At the Windows login screen, I still am unable to type anything. The trackpad does not work either. I restart and enter the BIOS - the keyboard WORKS. Ok, it works there but not on Windows? Huh...

I dismantle the machine once more. I notice that I did a half-assed job with the connector going to the trackpad. I hadn't pushed it in all the way! I quickly rectify that, and reconnect the keyboard cable. I make sure it is perfectly seated, and then secure it. I reassemble the machine and boot it up. 

I let out an audible cheer! The keyboard AND trackpad work! I beam with pride and enter in my login password. Now I can finally attend to my mom's problem.

My eyes slowly drift to the bottom-right corner of the screen. The battery was near dead. How can this be? She had it plugged in. Then I remembered - she cleaned the house today and moved the laptop to the other end of the table she normally sits at. What probably occurred is that the charging connector was knocked out of its normal position, causing it to lose connection. Then, commence battery depletion all day long (we leave it running). I was still confused as to how she was able to restart this thing multiple times, but nonetheless, I dash for the charger and plug in it.

Happily, the laptop indicates that it is charging now. I figure my work here is complete. I don't receive any thanks (typical), but I do feel accomplished. It was a good day.

So, about a month ago, one of our users went traveling to some trade shows and wanted to take a laptop with her on which representatives of other companies place orders.  Fair enough.  She sends me an email asking for a guest account with a password.  Also, fair enough.  

So, knowing that stolen/lost laptops are one of the biggest sources of information theft, I placed a reasonably secure password on it (replacing letters with symbols and letters), but still based on a phrase that should have been easy to remember (&lt;company&gt; sales).  I, of course, got chewed out for making a complex password.  However, she did not request a new password, and just said, ""Whatever, I'll deal with it.""

She and the laptop have been back for a couple of weeks now, but this is the first time I've looked at the laptop at all (it's a spare), so I opened it up and saw a sticky note with the username and password written on it.  I understand that it was a fairly complex password, but she may as well have not had the password on it at all with it taped there.

Anyway, here it goes.

A few years ago I worked for a small PC repair shop. It was a normal day until one customer came in with a tiny box. I thought nothing of it at first. The conversation went (roughly) as follows:

Me:""Afternoon sir, what can I help with today?""
Him:""I need my tower fixed right now.""
Me:""Well, that's what I'm here for. Whats the issue?""
Him:""Well, you see...""
*At this point his eyes shift towards the tiny box*
Him:""I smashed my computer with a hammer.""
*No idea what to say or do*
Me:""Can... can I see the box?""
*He slides it over to me*
*As I open the box, I am horrified at what I see*
The entirety (atleast what I think was the entire computer) resided within the box. Motherboard was smashed, processor's pins missing and bent, graphics card in around 15 pieces, the list goes on.
Me:""If you don't mind me asking...*what happened?*""
Him:""I took a hammer to my computer. I got a bit 'upset'.""
Me:""Well, I don't-""
Him:""Can you fix it? I need it for my raid tonight.""
*Again, I am flabbergasted*
Him:""I'm serious. Is it fixable?""
Me:""Uhh, I regret to inform you, that it would be damn near impossible to attempt anything in this state...""
*As I finished explaining various details of why it cannot be fixed, he stomps out of the door*

bradfo83,0,9,1n6wdm,17,"Back in college I used to work tech support for a pretty big dial-up ISP in 2006/2007-ish. As you could imagine the main demographic for dial up users at the time were essentially people in very rural areas, and of course old people. I have many stories from my tenure there, but I wanted to share a gem that I have always remembered.

A large portion of the calls that I had to field involved users logging in in order to connect the modem via dial-up. I would constantly get users who forgot their password, misspelled usernames, etc. This one case in particular though - an older gentleman was unable to login to his account. Through the tools I was using, I was able to see that he was inputting his username (which was an email address) or password incorrectly. I must have spent a good 5 minutes going through the username and password to make sure he was spelling everything correctly, checking for caps lock, etc. After much confusion, as to what the problem was, I had him spell out his username as he typed it. Here is an example of what I heard over the phone:

J-O-H-N-period-S-M-I-T-H-**A-T**-M-Y-I-S-P-period-C-O-M

Destrae,20,13,1n6rys,52,"I'll try to make this short and sweet.  
  
I work tech support for a medium sized company (around 1,300 employees). Yesterday about 20 minutes before I was supposed to leave I get a call from one of our very few remote users, telling me his computer has been a bit slow for about 2 weeks.  
  
This guy talks slow as hell, and I'm interrupting him like every 8th word to keep him on track, and trying to get him to connect to me. Bomgar was throwing an error back at me when I was trying to connect via his IP or Host Name, so I try to walk him through connecting to me with our support.companyname.com site. He's using Chrome, so I ask that he opens up Internet Explorer.  
  
He has the most difficult time explaining what's actually happening (uhhhhhh and tongue clicking do not count as explaining) saying that IE has a bunch of stuff and keeps crashing, so I ask if he can get to his email, and send him a support link. It took me about 5 minutes to actually connect to him, and the very first thing I see is [this beauty](http://i.imgur.com/BAgTlkBh.png?1). A bit slow? He's lucky it takes less than 30 minutes to boot up.  
  
This is literally the *worst* computer I have ever worked on. In our company, the only people who get admin rights on their machine are laptop users, apparently so they can install every fucking piece of freeware under the sun. IE had so much shit that it was using over 3GB of RAM.  
  
He claimed that his machine has been slow for about 2 weeks, but had free ware and toolbars installed from over a year ago. Task Manager showed over 160 process running, and in a 5 minute MBAM scan showed almost 600 infections.  
  
[Here is the full album](http://imgur.com/a/5T7rv), for maximum cringe.  
  
We recently updated our company to Kaspersky 10, which he didn't receive, so we had no way of knowing about the problem until he called us. Unfortunately I forgot to get more screenshots of the installed software. If this computer wasn't on the other side of the country I would have imaged it in a heartbeat.

jellybeannie,4,11,1n6rlm,49,"I've worked in tech support for over 6 years now, but in this story I was actually the one who needed support.

Apparently, the way iSky support works is they have 'concierge-type' analysts (of course they don't call them that) who act as a go-between for engineers and end users.

Mercutio879,7,12,1n6qxo,65,"This happened way back, at my first tech support job. A software company decided to open up a small computer sales/repair shop. It was fun for a while. 

About 6 months into my job, a rather... large woman walked in with a Pentium II Dell. It was a white case Dell, or at one time, it was. The front bezel had turned a sickening yellow, and the metal shell was full of coffee rings and mysterious sticky spots. Note that this was probably mid 2004, so the Pentium II was old news. 

The lady (I think) said that it was running slow, and would shut itself off after 30 minutes of use. We gave her our standard cleaning rate, $125 total, and she agreed. She left. 

I already knew what was coming, but I was unprepared for the horror I witnessed when I slid the case off. The heatsink was a brown blob, the motherboard was covered in a combination of nicotine and cat hair, and the exhaust fans were begging for a swift death. And the smell. I used to smoke, but the smell nearly had me vomiting. 

After calling up one of the software support devs to take a look and show him the Lovecraftian horror, I set to work. A combination of paper towels, rubbing alcohol and qtips, and the motherboard was clean. More for the heat sink. Three hours of scrubbing and the computer was at least respectable. I happened to have another DIMM in one of my drawers, so I put that in as well. I replaced the power supply fan with an old one from a dead PC, and cleaned the case fan, still noisy, but at least it spun. I cleaned the outside of the case, put it back together and fired it up.  Windows 95?!?! I dug out a Windows 98 SE CD and gave her an upgrade. Then proceeded to remove the dozens of viruses and spyware that had clogged every bit of her 32 MB of RAM. 

A full day later, the old Dell was singing like never before. 

I called the lady who came down the next morning to pick it up. 'Looks good' she grunted, and handed me a check. 

'If you did a good job with this one, I'll bring you my GOOD PC.' 

After she left, I whimpered 'Please don't.'

Background: We work for a small software company providing technical support. When I was a full-time tech here, there were four techs answering calls. Now, we have a very small user base, so this was plenty. We only provide phone, email, and chat support. This particular tech has worked here for 8-10 years, so he should be competent, right? NOPE. He's bad to the point where he is the ONLY tech to ever work at this company where customers will outright refuse to work with him. He can be wildly inappropriate, and coherent sentences seem to be beyond his grasp. He is also one of those employees who will completely ignore the chain of command and call the OWNER up to talk about something that isn't even a problem, just something that he himself didn't understand. He comes marching over to the development side of things any time he has any kind of issue without first testing the issue to find out if it's a bug or not. He's just an all around terrible employee.

I was forced by our COO, her father-in-law, to give her server access to manually download files from the EDI system.  (It's too much of a hassle to send a support ticket for me to troubleshoot it.)  Surprisingly, things went OK, I gave her detailed instructions on how to manually import files, and she has done fine.  Then this morning, as I'm driving to work, I get this call:

I know what I'm looking for when it comes to troubleshooting issues because that's what I went to college to learn to do.  If you don't know what you're looking for, it is easy to do more harm than good.  You've done good the last few months, would you be interested in taking some computer classes at Local Community College?

**Derp:** I guess I do need to learn more.  Maybe a class or two would help.

**Me:**  I'll talk to our COO and see if the company would be willing to pay for them.  I could use someone to do some basic troubleshooting when I'm out or get bogged down with support tickets.

I used to work in a very large private Auto parts company, that was pretty much 100% family owned. I say this only because who you knew was often more important than skill level in some of these cases. I'll just leave it at that.  
  
Back then I worked in hardware/ tier III support. There were 4 people when I got there, supporting maybe 2000 users on the local campus(IT, Headquarters, data center, software dev, etc), and another 30000 remote machines. They would ship them in for repair and we'd ship them back.  
  
So, we get a ticket to deliver a new laptop set-up for a new hire on the security team. Nothing new. We keep stock pre-imaged, and basically just have to set-up the users profile, and allow our client automation process to complete. (HPCAE)  
  
A co-worker and I, load up the dual monitors, stand, Laptop, docking station w/ monitor stand*, cables, surge protector etc, drive to headquarters, and set it all up.  
  
My Co-worker, shows the new person, how to seat the laptop in the dock, and how to release it again, since a lot of new users have difficulty lining it up. But she gets it, no problem. We stand around, BS a bit and head back to the shop.  
  
Fast forward, next morning. We get a sev 1 ticket, new rity user machine will not power on. Co-worker and I grab some tickets and head over to HQ again.  We get there and sure enough she's standing there waiting.  
  
We ask what the issue is and she says the machine won't power on.  
  
My co-worker walks to her desk, looks at her workstation and asks, ""Ok, can I see your laptop?, I'll give it a try.""  
  
After a brief pause she blurts out, ""Oh, I need that? I thought that one was for home and this one was for the office!""  
  
I lost my shit, OMG, I put some space between me and the cube and tried to compose myself, while my co-worker had to explain to her that an empty docking station indeed would not power on.

cybervegan,20,17,1n51tq,35,"Greybeard the geek back again, this time with a story from not so long ago. My previous job 2008-2013 was working at a small IT services provider in Birmingham, UK as the ""pet Linux geek"". My duties were basically looking after everything Linux-based - both internal and customer kit, mostly based in datacentres. I also mucked-in with general telephone support and helpdesk duties as and when required. It was a ""one big family"" type of place.

So one morning, I was pootling through the morning's helpdesk tickets, and the phone went. My colleague answered the call, and all I heard was:

S_____ (colleague): ""Good morning, IT support, how can I help?""

...

(At this point my mobile starts to ring, and I answer, as it's J___ from C______ )

         cybervegan: ""Hello J___, cybervegan here, how can I help?""

         J___: ""Hi, F____ has just called the helpdesk, but it's urgent - C______'s website is down. Can you please take a look.""

         cybervegan: ""Ok, wait a second, I'll see what's happening on Nagios...""

         (Call up C_____'s Nagios page, red everywhere. My Thunderbird e-mail client then started whining ""Alert, Alert"" which is what it did when I received critical alerts from C_____'s servers)

         cybervegan: ""Yes, I see there are a lot of criticals, and I've just received some alerts - it's literally just gone down...""

...

S_____: ""One moment please, I will see if cybervegan is available.... I'm afraid he's on another call.""

....

          J_____: ""Yes, F____ just did something. He's on the other line, can you speak to him?""

S____ (to me): ""cybervegan, F____ is on the line, says it's really urgent.""

          (F____ is C_____'s lead developer)

          cybervegan to J____: ""Ok, I'll update you when I know more...""

          J____: ""Ok. Speak later. Bye.""

S____ puts F____ through to my desk-phone.

           cybervegan: ""Hi F____, I can see the website's down. I'll take...""

           F_____ (interrupting me): ""cybervegan, I am afraid it is my fault. When was the last database backup?""

           cybervegan: ""Well, it's in cron.daily, and on CentOS, that runs about 0402am. Should be one from this morning.""

           F_____: ""Ah, good. Can you restore it? I made a little mistake...""

           (I'd made quite a big thing about getting the backups sorted out since when I'd first started, they didn't have much of a backup system).

           cybervegan: ""What happened? What did you do?""

           F_____: ""I was doing an SQL update to the BigMainTable_with_2_million_rows to fix a customer's corrupted records... I accidentally missed off the 'where' clause...""

           cybervegan: ""That's not good. That's the biggest table in the database... I hope we don't have to do a full restore, because that will take *hours*...""

           F_____: ""How long do you think it will take? Can you do just that table?""

This particular morning, my mysql-and-grep-foo was flexed to it's limits; I managed to break out the backup of BigMainTable_with_2_million_rows from the mysqldump backup and restore it within about 30 minutes (I turned off index updates) and got the web-site up again in about 35 minutes. I just *knew* this wasn't going to be the last time I was going to do this for this customer (and I was right - I'll post about some of them sometime).

Needless to say F____ and J____ were very pleased, but unbeknownst to me, I was making a rod for my own back...

TL;DR: some developers shouldn't have WRITE access to the live database; they tend to delete entire massive tables by forgetting to put in ""where custid='firkin doobery' and status=0"" or something on the end of random SQL updates....

You lot probably know me more as that ~~imbecile~~ guy that runs around making wisecracks, and terrible jokes in the form of comments and puns.  
So to make it up to you, here's a post to my favourite subreddit (skip to the TL;DR if you don't 'enjoy' posts of length).

This, is a tale of my younger sister. She acquired the iFern 4s a few days after it's release here in the land down (as opposed to the prices for these things) under.

Shortly after, we went on a family holiday (we weren't deemed ""responsible"" enough to be left at home on our own) to South-East Asia. During our trip, they were at the beach, as I was staying over at a cousin's place.

My Dad notices that my sister is about to head to the ocean with her iFern in her pocket. The usual ""Don't do that"" conversation occurs, and my sister assures him that she's only going to stand in the water, where the water can't touch it.

One thing leads to another, and she waddles in to where the waterline reaches a few centimetres below her pocket. While busy daydreaming about the release of the iFern 5c, a wave came up, and managed to ""just reach up to"" the base of the phone.

Scurrying back to the place they were staying (a relative's house) like a certain pokemon trainer, they noticed it would turn on, and then go into a kernel panic (which was described to me as ""text comes on the screen""). In the first signal of intelligence in a while, they decided to Google solutions to this... problem. They used a hair dryer, put it in rice, let it set overnight, the ""whole nine yards"".

So we get back to Melbourne, and we book an appointment with the Grapple Treeniuses, which we went to after she had finished school that day. I, as the most ""tech-y"" (as they would say) person in the house, was commanded to accompany her.

The Treenius looks at the phone, the kernel panic, and asks us if this iFern ""has been in contact with water"". Not wanting to incriminate myself, and understanding the ramifications of lying to support of any kind, turn towards my sister, who says ""No, when I went to turn it on one morning, this happened!"". So he explains to us that he needs to ""take the iFern out to the back to take a look at something"", to which my sister readily agrees.

He returns after several minutes, disassembled iFern in hand. He asks my sister one more time: ""Did this iFern come into contact with water?"".

{ Optional: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBknAcTaMiI }

My sister shakes her head, and responds in a manner that suggests she's entirely certain this was not the case.

""Well, you see, it must have, because ... "" the Treenius said, taking a moment to pause for effect. ""It's rusting."", he finished, revealing to us the now-disassembled iFern 4s with entirely brown rust running down the side of one part of the motherboard, and the look of humiliation on my sister's face.

I paid for a replacement iFern at cost price (because she forgot her debit card), and I had to sprint to catch up with my sister as she rushed out of the Grapple Store.

TL;DR: **Your face is red, the ocean is blue. You lied to the [over-glorified] support guy, the joke's on you!**

TheFlarf,15,35,1n327h,143,"First: I apologize for taking so long to post part two, I'm a college student trying to be responsible, and the various organizations I'm a part of take a ton of my time


Anyways onwards to the story

So the first month or so most of my job was just doing odd tasks coupled with the occasional IT problem.  When **BSG** would go on a trip I would research the building he was going to present at, find a hotel, and make sure his presentation worked and his computer was set up correctly.  Probably a month in to my employment **BSG** comes out and asks me how much I know about mobile apps.  I explained that I had made an app for android and felt pretty knowledgeable, while wondering if he's seriously going to ask me to write an app for him.  He motions for me to come back to his office where an employee who had left the company about a year ago,DeutschesCoder(DC), is sitting at the conference table.

DC was the tech person before me, and left the company about a year and a half before I joined.  I still hit him up on occasion for help on the server, or the few programs or routines he wrote.  We sit down and **BSG** starts explaining his grand idea for what he wants this app to look like.  DC pulls out his iPad and starts to show me a ***very*** primitive version of the app.  I start playing with it while listening to **BSG** and DC discuss how the development process will work (this is being developed by a third party y'all haven't met yet) and how DC is supposed to be the go-between us and the development studio.  I occasionally chime in or ask a question, but for the most part I'm exploring what was built and taking notes.  After **BSG** and DC finished their meeting, I hand DC back his iPad and a sheet and a half of legal paper that included bugs, glitches, and other issues with the app.  DC looked genuinely shocked, explaining that he had gone over the thing top to bottom with the developers and that it worked when he looked at it.

DC was very dubious of my finds and starts testing my reported bugs while confirming that yes: I'm only 17, I'm only a senior in high school, and my only formal education with computers was a semester of AP computer science.  Turns out everything I wrote on my sheet was valid and left both DC and **BSG** stumped at how ""just a kid"" could figure all of that out.  DC left, and from that day forward **BSG** regarded me as a computer wizard, rarely to be questioned.

Tl;DR BSG impressed by *über leet* beta testing.

**For those curious:**

The app that has now been successfully deployed to both iOS and Android app stores is target at building managers of high rise building.  The app is designed to help manage critical systems in a large building and accompany our physical product.  I wish I could go in to more detail, but since it is such a niche product it would be awfully easy to identify the company I work for.

~~--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**Bonus Story:**
So I know this story was a bit boring, but it was kinda necessary to introduce the app for lots of sequential stories.  This is the story I told my friends before the finally convinced me to post on TFTS, and for that matter use Reddit.

It's about noon and I just got back from Wendy's and was sitting down to my desk about to devour my lunch.  I become aware that my mom was talking to a client on the phone, and was obviously unsure, or confused.  I turn around and give her a look, wondering if it's an issue with the app.  My suspicions are soon confirmed as I hear ""hold on just a minute, let me transfer you to our technical support.  Damnit! I hate talking to customers because I have a lisp, a slight stutter, and am awkward in general.  I pick up the phone ""Hello, this is Flarf, how can I help you?""

User: ""I'm having trouble downloading your app from the app store""

Me: ""Are you having trouble finding it, or did it not download correctly""

User: ""It's not in the store at all.""

Me: ""Try searching for-""

User: ""No it's not in the store at all.  Actually...let me back up, I work IT at {super important client building} and when I go to search for the app in the store it's not there at all.  I went to your website on my tablet and clicked the link, but it just dropped me to the play store home page.""

     Oh hey a user who actually knows what they are doing.

Me: ""Okay give me a moment""
  
     I pull my tablet over, slightly irritated that my frys are getting cold, and go to our website and
     check to see if the link is valid.  Sure enough, I'm dropped on the app page like I would expect.

Me: ""I'm seeing the link work fine on my device. Wait... y'all are based in Canada, correct?""

User: ""Yes, I'm at {super important client building}""

Me: ""Let's see if that has anything to do with it, the app should work in Canada, but the iOS store temporarily removed our app from the Canadian store.""
    
    I then have him navigate to our app from his desktop's web browser

User: ""It says here this app is not compatible with my devices, and it lists the three tablets we have.""

Me: ""Uhm, that shouldn't be happening, let me give a call to the developers.""

User: ""No problem, here's my number to call back""

So I get off the phone and explain to my mother what happened.  She told me to do what was already on my mind: call 
KoderKing(KK).  KK is the co-founder of the development studio, and lead developer on our app.  He is an amazing guy and has been somewhat of a mentor to me.  I will try and build his character a little more in a later post.

I explain to KK what was going on, and he checked on the Google developer page and on the page for our app it said that User's device was one of the devices the app would work on.  We go back and forth a little bit, trying to determine a solution. While we were still trying to work it out, I tracked down a ROM for the device while he emails Google Play tech support to figure out a solution.  He loads up an emulated copy of the device, and sure enough he can't download the app.  Soon after he gets a response from Play that says that's an issue to bring up with the device manufacturer.  Yay!

So I call Lenovo tech support and get bounced around no fewer than 8 representatives over three hours.  Finally I hit someone in tier 3 support who tells me that there really is no one in tech support that can help me.  They haven't set up any sort of support for developers who have issues with device-app issues.  He said he would bring the issue up with the firmware guys, but there likely won't be a fix.

It is now nearing 4PM and I still haven't gotten to finish my lunch so I take a quick break from talking on the phone to finish my now cold lunch, and melted frosty.  I call the User back and tell him what I've been told over the last few hours, and that I don't have a solution quite yet, neither Google Play nor Lenovo has offered any help, and I am completely stumped.  He responds saying that he expects the app to be on his device by close of business or he will not pay us, and spread the word that our app is a fraud and a waste of everyone's time.

**OH SHIT!**

4:10 I got 50 minutes.  I call KK back and get a voice-mail that he is out of the office.  Try to talk to his assistant to see if he can give me a copy of the current APK, he is absolutely useless to try and get any information from.

4:15 I research how to root my tablet, so I can extract the APK from my tablet's file system.

4:25 THANK YOU ASUS for providing a simple how-to on rooting my tablet.

4:30 create a new Amazon account and get a free-tier server up and running, since I didn't have the password to the existing one.

4:35 Use one of the 20 something domains **BSG** had already bought (he bought them all because he read some article, in some business magazine, that you should buy domains for anything you might want to sell so domain parkers don't steal them) and forward it to my fresh AWS server.

4:40 Successfully FTP in to the server and upload the APK. Send User an email with the link to the apk in it

4:45 Call back the User.  A very irate building manager picks up the phone talking about how our app doesn't exist and we are trying to charge her for nothing.  I ask her to open the web address in the email, she complies grumbling the entire time.  After a minute or so she logs in to the app and I hear ""Oh my gosh, this is really wonderful.... I need to call **BSG** back and apologize for my nasty message, thank you Flarf.""

About 10 minutes later **BSG** comes out of his office and asks the full story of what happened.  I tell him everything that happened that day including my mad dash to allow the client to install the app.  He responded saying ""I'm not quite sure what happened earlier because {building manager} had nothing nice to say to me, but she just called saying that Flarf got everything up and running for her, and she is pleased with her app.  Expect a nice bonus in your check""

TL;DR Google Play derped our app download for one device.  I take the last 30 minutes out of my day to root my own personal tablet, and create a webserver so client can download app.  **BSG** thoroughly impressed, acquired bonus.

Ormuzd,99,106,1n2bh5,502,"This literally just happened earlier today and I'm honestly still kind of feeling it from the shock this gave me.  So here goes the story.

For the last week we have been working on moving/replacing a few of the telephone wire racks due to an upgrade.  So today just before lunch I was tearing out one of the racks that was no longer going to be in use so I had taken out most of the of the punch panels when i found a wire that passed straight up the back of the rack never being hooked to anything.  Thinking it was just an extra wire someone had run I gave it a tug only to find it was securely attached, so i traced the wire and found it come out of one wall pass though the rack then back into the wall following the rest of the cables.

Not sure what to make of it I leave it be while I finish taking apart the rest of the rack.  Over lunch I ask the other guys what they think it could be, and what to do with it.  The resounding answer was fuck it, cut the thing and be done with it.  So i get back to work and find this wire pull out my leatherman tool and proceed to cut the cable.  This is where shit gets crazy,  as soon as i break the the insulation i hear something that sounds like an alarm go off followed immediately by pain.  The other guys come running to see what happened to find me laying on the floor a few feet away from where there wire rack was cursing and pointing at the wall screaming ""That fucking thing just shocked me"".  Everyone kind of laughs and say there is no way it was that bad when one of the guys grabs the wire by the end I had cut and he gets hit with it too.  

After everyone makes sure no one is to bad off one of the guys breaks out a multimeter to see what is going on.  Someone had run 220v though the network cable on the green pair.  Though soon after he gets the reading the power cuts off, we figure it blew the fuse or what ever the hell it was plugged into.  Then the fire alarm goes off, they rush to see what happened thinking it was another false alarm and come back about 15min later to notify me the main phone rack for this side of the building had caught fire.  

Since all of this originated from this one crazy wire we decided to trace it though the building to see what the hell was done.  It turns out someone had run a direct line from the main telcom closet to an intercom speaker w/ amp in a conference room.  The kicker was they had striped the wire back enough the punch the blue and orange pair for the speakers then ran the green off the to side and spliced them into an electrical socket.  I didn't think those wires were rated to carry more than 5v, the fact someone managed to pass 220v though it without setting anything on fire to start with I find amazing.  Sadly now we have a lot more work to do since they burned out a good part of the main switch due to this bullshit.

Never could get anyone to lay claim to running this wire though, so somewhere out there he still lurks.  Ever pushing the boundaries of technology with his Frankenstein like creations. 

** UPDATE**

So I went back today to finish up and decided to document what was done here so I could show my boss.  Ignore my MS paint skills it is all I had on hand to work with.

[Power over Ethernet](http://imgur.com/a/hNZOc)

The 220 negative was passed though a door bell for some unknown reason (maybe used as some sort of shitty voltage drop?).  This thing was stored in a fucking closet so no one would ever hear it.  The Orange and Green pair from the network cable were split off and spliced into an unknown brown wire that ran into floor and vanished (Orange to positive, both whites to negative, green to ground).  From the looks of it this thing was set up where someone could either call into the intercom via an extension or they had a direct feed from where ever that brown wire ended up.

I don't know what they did here but I will always be cutting all network cables w/ a pair of insulated wire snips from now on.

I'm the last guy in line...3 people (at least) have looked at a ticket before it gets to me, and if I can't solve an issue, it's listed as a defect and up to engineering to hotfix. The jobs of each of the T1, T2, and T3 guys is to read the problem description, gather any/all available data, make sure everything is accurate, and solve it if they can. That way I don't have to waste my time hunting down information. So I usually trust that the things that come from T3 have been investigated and are accurate. Normally this is fine. 

So yesterday I get a ticket in with the following description:

""Fatal errors occurring during shutdown."" 

No other real information provided at all, just some speculation on their part which is completely irrelevant. 

...Okay. I mean, this is fairly common, our logging throws all sorts of errors when we're shutting the application down. Plus, if you're shutting it down, and it doesn't shut down gracefully, it doesn't matter (because of what type of software this is...it seriously makes no difference how it shuts down, as long as it does and comes back up properly later). So I see no problem with this. 

On top of this, when I go to investigate the logs just in case I can spot some problem during shutdown, I see nothing out of the ordinary at all. Application shuts down, hardware is rebooted, application starts up. No issues whatsoever. I send it back to L1 and ask them to clarify.

Today, I get an email that says ""Actually this is occurring only occasionally, and only during startup. The logs we captured didn't capture the issue, we can't reproduce it.""

Apparently I was supposed to not only know that ""error during shut down"" means ""crash during start up,"" I was supposed to diagnose the issue without any information actually pertaining to the reported issue. I wonder in what universe ""shutdown"" is a synonym for ""startup.""

 He is new so I figure he has not read the basic instructions that we put together for new users to set up the greeting for voicemail, name in the directory and the basic use of the phone.


I browse to his pc and drop the directions on his desktop, and shoot him a message asking him to review the word doc and reach out if he still is having a problem.

I try walking him threw the basic steps, you press forward the dial 8 then the number. he is in Connecticut, so he must also include the area code, even for non long distance calls.  bert replied back quickly ""I tried that"".


I huffed and puffed for a minute, knowing I had to go to his location to hold his hand. He is only a mile or so away, so I let him know I was on my way.

I look at him stunned.  he blinks a few times with that glazed over look that we all know.

I took CAD in high school.  It was a small district, and we had only two industrial arts teachers.  One for shop, one for wood shop/drafting/CAD.

The CAD teacher was quite knowledgeable about woodworking, and drafting.  He even owned his own lumber company.  But he was quite old and computers harbored a lot of mysteries for him.

One morning, he calls to us all up to his desk.  No exaggerating, this is what he said:

""Gather 'round, children!  I have something magical to show you.  I discovered if you click this button right here, it changes something called 'FONT'.  It's what the letters look like.""

2. Unplug it
3. Place a note informing everyone nearby not to touch

The electronics for this were in a big thick insulated box, and consisted primarily of a rather large water cooled circuit board. Not a water cooled board like you'd have at home though, no this was pretty much a pair of foot square boards, with a cooling system sandwiched in between them. 

We had been on the phone with tech support from the manufacturer who told us to remove the voltage controller and power it up and see what happend. We said we would try that and call him back. 

So, we removed the voltage controller, turned on the system, and then waited about 30 seconds, at which point the huge water cooled circuit board burst into flames. Not smoke, not snmolering flickering flames, no, no, good 2 foot tall flames with billowing black smoke and the stench that can only be created by the toxic fumes of burning sillicone and polymer, it lingered for a good solid week. We shut the door on it, which mostly smothered it, a fire exinguisher finished the job. 

Needless to say we were a bit suppried by the result, so we called up the manufacturer. Here is that conversation verbatim.

waka_flocculonodular,28,28,1n0mwq,119,"Greetings, fellow ITers. I bring to you another story, one of mystery and gratitude. 

I work at a university help/consulting desk for our learning management system, Blackboard. If you know Blackboard, you know how straightforward it can be; make a change to visibility or a permission, hit ""Submit"" and you're good. Some departments have their own 'course' where they can share internal documents with each other, internal things not meant for students. In the control panel of the course, you can choose the 'availability,' or access permissions, through the course. 

I've been opening up almost every morning during summer session, and it's been incredibly slow. I've also been working almost six months at my job, so I haven't seen many situations that would be deemed an emergency. 

Enter: Philosophy instructor who is somehow also in charge of the internal Blackboard 'course.' We will call her **Inst**.

**Inst:** Hi. I need an administrator **now**. Something is wrong with our account.

**Waka:** Ok. Start from the beginning (what course, term, what's wrong, etc.)

**Inst:** No. I need an administrator. Something's wrong. One of the students said that they can see all of the other grad student files. 

**Waka:** Ok…And what course is this? Is this an internal department course? 

**Inst:** Yes. 

**Waka:** So how are they enrolled?

**Inst:** They're not. What? What are you talking about? Just fix it!!

**Waka:** Well, lets see who's enrolled in your course….(going through regular procedures)

**Inst:** (increasing in frustration)

(boss' boss calls Instructor into her office, 1.5 feet away. We'll call her tier2)

**Tier2** Hi, Instructor, my name is Tier2, let's talk about your situation, blah blah blah

**Inst:** Ok

She goes in and they start talking, I finish going through my tickets (but am secretly listening into the conversation). They start going through people that have 'instructor' level permissions, and it's not bringing up anybody. They worked on it for a good two hours before finally escalating to our Tier 3 sysadmin, who figured out one of the people who had access to the course changed the 'visibility' of the course to 'guest,' which meant that anybody on active directory signed in to Blackboard could access it. 

tl;dr : Review permissions. Know where those settings are. Make sure other people know their permissions as well.","Permissions, son",147

YourTechGuy,51,23,1n01ob,112,"Seeing as my plans fell through tonight, I figured its time for another post.

Okay, so as you may or may know (depending on how awesome your memory is or how interested you are in my post history), I'm an IT consultant but before I used to do tech support for local businesses and households. 

So I get a call from a friend of one of my larger clients at the time saying her desktop no longer boots. Shouldn't be a problem I say, but I have one thing with house calls: I can't be in a house with any pets that have fur (goddam allergies). Well this woman happens to have far too many cats (And she doesn't even Reddit!), so she says she'll drop off the computer at my office.

I get the computer and externally everything looks okay. I confirm that it is in fact not booting (I unplugged *and* plugged it back it), and decide to crack open the case. It stunned me.

I should be more specific. The complete closing of my nose and throat stunned me, but the computer was equally remarkable. Every cable, RAM module, and fan was clogged with cat fur. You know those old computers that have a layer of dust on every component? Imagine that but with fur.

Well apparently this computer has spent the far share of its life (read: all of it) confined to a small area under a desk in thick shag carpeting. And the cats just *loved* to climb and sit on it.

Well the motherboard didn't. At one point or another, it had set one fire. Apparently smoke/smells/etc is quite enough to clue a modern computer user into a fire and when the computer stopped working it was chalked up to the magic of computers. 

I called the user and told her that the computer suffered severe internal damage from the fire. I told her ways she could prevent this from happening with her next computer when she dropped the question:

""Well can it be fixed?"" &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;

She was unwilling to learn to the point where I would literally have to tell her to click places because I wasn't going to use her mouse for her.

Ripwkbak,30,44,1mzh1k,88,"This is a few tales of a new employee that we hired recently and the lovely calls we have gotten from him. 

A bit of background, this is a large scale farming company for which i provide tech support. So obviously it being a large group of farmers and farm workers, you expect to get a lot of not that bright questions about computers. But there are also people that work here in the research and development part that you would expect to have Some understanding of computer right? no wrong... very wrong. 

This employee in particular is a Bee expert that just got his doctorate in entomology. Now I would expect that in the amount of time one spent at college getting a doctorate even if it was in entomology that you would at least get a very basic understanding of computers right? no, wrong again. at least in this case. 

So first day comes around, we give him his new laptop, new cellphone (nice new iphone 5) and a new Ipad. I show him how to log on to our computers get him set up with his Ipad and all that, as well as VPN.

Second day he comes in and this was the conversation.

Rip:Hey Newguy, how are things going?

Newguy: not that great I cant log in, it just keeps giving me this error. 

Rip: Ok, well lets take a look.

He takes out the laptop doesn't plug Anything into it, no network cable that is on our bench he is next too, nothing (we don't have wifi in most buildings). and he starts it up and proceeded to try and log in. 

Rip: Well your biggest problem is that you need to plug it in to the network otherwise you wont be able to log in. (he didn't have a local profile set up at that time all of his stuff was on the network.)

Newguy: What really? I thought because it was a laptop it would just you know, connect with wifi or something because we were in the main office. isnt that how it works? 

(Really, just connecting automatically no setup no nothing just have your computer magically work because you are within the building of the company that owns the laptop, wouldn't that just be cool. )

Rip: yea, you kinda have to connect it so you can get on. especially the first few times.

Newguy: Ohhh.. Ya, I thought it would just work. because you know,the other office has wifi (now this other office, the one he is stationed at, is over 100 miles away, sure lets connect to that, from 100 miles away and with it never having been configured.)

Rip: well yea, that office has Some wifi, but it isnt generally how we connect, usually in the office we use a dock. (Show him one, how it works ect.)

After that he goes on his way all is well


But it doesn't stop there, the call I got from him the next day tops our most dumbest call list. By a longshot. 

Rip: This is Rip how can I help you?

Receptionist: Hello, the new Bee guy he is having problems turning on Gordy(the Boss Bee Guy) computer, he keeps pressing the power button but nothing happens he says the monitor is on but nothing comes up. 


Now a few things are bothering me, this guy struck me as to have a bit of a entitled attitude and it was really annoying that he had the receptionist call me instead of just him calling me. Makes trying to fix things way harder than it needs to by adding another person that really isn't involved at all. The other thing that instantly hit me, was that Gordy is very good with computers, not a entitled douche, and very smart. So I quickly came to the conclusion Gordy is not there, and when Gordy is not there Gordy's laptop is not there, Ever. so the guy was trying to turn on [This](http://imgur.com/C7U0Y6C) without the computer in it. After I finally stopped laughing and crying I told the receptionist what was going on, after a second of thought she said ""You are right, I'll go let the new guy know"". 

Its good to know we are providing top of the line equipment to this guy so he can not use it. I have yet to see him use his Ipad once, and he generally doesn't have his laptop anywhere. His most used piece of equipment? A notepad. The only thing I will say about that, is at least he realizes he is horribly inept at using technology and uses what he knows.

I then tried prodding the screen nearby to the bug to see if it moved, and lo and behold it did; the thing's alive! Unfortunately, I tried a second time and inadvertently squashed the thing. I now have a dead bug trapped inside my monitor. It appears to be in front of the backlight, and behind the LCD panel, so I can't reach it to remove it.

To top this all off, I had a look on Amazon about returns, it turns out that due to the high value of the item, I can't just submit a support ticket / email, I actually have to ring them up. I now have the fun task of explaining to Amazon over the phone, that I have a dead bug trapped inside my monitor, and that I need a replacement. Hopefully they believe me, and I sincerely apologise if the person who has to deal me with me happens to browse this subreddit!

Ralkkai,23,24,1myfr1,47,"So this is somewhat of a rant but computer related so I wanted to post it here. 

My mom. Let me tell you about my mother. She is the type that will not download ANYTHING because it IS a virus and it WILL destroy EVERYTHING on the surface of the planet, should she download it. She also has a pretty powerful phone, dual-core, 1.5 GB RAM and all that jazz. She will not download anything at all on that either. She literally has a $600 phone that she refuses to use other then to call people.

Any way, I got into a raging screaming match with her on Facebook over the weekend. Here is the tale of Microsoft, Hotmail, and security:

My mother posted a rather belligerent, drunken status on Saturday, early evening. Something to the affect of “I'm not going to give some random so-and-so my phone number, thank you very much. Well, looks like I have to completely switch emails since Hotmail is becoming the thought police.”

I basically explained to her that it was M$ releasing a batch of security updates and it was merely for her convenient should she ever get locked out of her account. She wouldn't have any of it.

She replied with something on the lines of how this isn't on her phone. It's on the comp[uter.] And why does the computer need her phone number?

I tried to explain further that it isn't going to do anything malicious but she persisted, raging about how she isn't gonna have people texting her because she has limited data, etc. After some more back-and-forth, I laid this puppy on her:

&gt;“Holy shit. MS will only send you a text when you are locked out of your account IF that happens. And only if you, your self request it from the recovery options. It's automated. It's a computer program. A computer program isn't gonna send you random text messages asking how your day is going. AND it's all encrypted any way. Whatever you want to do though.”

That is how the conversation ended. It is beyond me that someone surrounded by so many computer savvy individuals could be this illiterate; I'm going for a degree in Computer Science, my dad is a redneck computer engineeer of sorts when he isn't working his job as an automotive technician, (he doesn't follow best practices in computer repair, but he gets by.) and my brother is a “hardcore” PC gamer, so what he does know, he has some handle on it, though he is still very much end-user status. 

She has an Android, with a Gmail account, so Google already has her freaking number anyway. It still strikes me as odd that we live in the age of social media and yet, we are too afraid to give out extremely limited data to automated software designed to aid in account recovery so you don't have to call M$'s help desk to recover your credentials. She was also one of the many who got caught up in the “Hypertext Transfer Protocol Scare of 2011” where everyone ran around all over the Word Wide Web putting S's on the end of their HTTP's because if protected their Facebook accounts from the Big Bad Internetz.

TL;DR: My mom thinks that an automated recovery service is going to randomly text her throughout the day asking her how her day is going.

Last week one of my female colleagues told me that her home computer was acting weird and the monitor would ""go blank with some text on it"" occasionally, one time she called me and read me the ""some text"" it was a ""no signal"" error. I told her to bring it in and I'll take a look at it, I was already suspecting a faulty GPU.

She brought in the computer, and as soon as I opened the case I noticed that the GPU's fan was disconected (it was an old AGP card), I plugged it back in, started the computer and started a hi-res youtube video to make sure it was working. Problem solved.

This is when it became interesting: ""since I already brought it here, can you install internet explorer for me ?"". I was speechless, not because she wanted to use internet explorer... but why would I need to install it ? ""oh, and could you install... how do you call that program... not Word, oh Excel, I need that too"". The computer was running Windows XP, I clicked Start &gt; All Programs and dragged Internet Explorer and Microsoft Excel to the desktop. **She confessed that she never started anything that wasn't on the desktop.**",The hidden secrets of the Start Menu.,1715

Siege__,82,80,1mxegd,317,"Hello, all! Long time, no see. The last story I submitted came just after I graduated college several months ago. Soon after that, I left the student job and spent a few months unemployed. Now I work for a company that created and is in charge of a data backup service (rhymes with ""BrashFlan""), working as a tier one support agent. 


Today started off as many shifts do - get in a bit early, take care of my personal ticket queue, do a call back or two. Things were going well for my first Sunday shift and my coworkers and I were having a good time joking around and sending each other funny YouTube links over IRC, when *he* called.


""BrashFlan support, this is Siege__,"" I said after being warned by the call center employee who transferred him to me that he needed help resetting his password. I thought it'd be easy.


I was wrong.


As soon as my name had fallen from my lips, a heavily-accented voice (possibly Swedish? It was for sure northern European) erupted from my headset, demanding to know why we changed his password on him. I'm hard of hearing to begin with, and even turning down my headset to the lowest volume I could without muting it wasn't enough to calm the assault on my eardrums. 


I explained to the enraged gentleman several times that the only way we were able to change his password would be for him to send an email from the account tied to his subscription explicitly stating he wanted the change done. That wasn't a good enough explanation. He treated me like I was mentally handicapped because I couldn't make sense of his piss poor description of the problem he was having.


He blew up at me, screaming and hollering to the point where I had to remove my headset and hold it away from my ears. I could still hear every word. After almost twenty minutes of verbal abuse and my giving him two warnings to not yell at me, I finally got it out of him that he was talking about his separate archive password he'd set up (it's an extra step of security, and completely optional to have for your backups; most don't bother with it), and not his main account password.


I had to explain to him another several times that we do not know, keep, or otherwise have access to customers' private archive passwords - they are the ones who set it, and they are the ones responsible for it. If they forget it, that's it. There's no way to retrieve the password, and they lose access to their backup archive. This gent wasn't having any of that. 


By now I was ready to reach through the phone and introduce his face to my fist, but I managed to get him off the line and headed outside for some air since I was so riled up (I spent years working retail and had never had someone yell at me so totally before; I wasn't the slightest bit rude to him, either, outside of asking him to not yell at me while I was trying to help him). When I came back in, I wrote up a report and talked to a supervisor, who wrote a ticket response to the person I had just sat through being yelled at by.


We looked at his information just to double-check, and sure enough, he had set a custom archive password. The caller had claimed that this archive password had been changed (no), and said that he had copy pasted his passwords into something like PasswordWallet and there was no way that they were wrong (they were). This meant that he would have to re-upload all of his data after deactivating and deleting his account, then recreating it, since he couldn't remember the actual password to his archive.


He has to re-upload nearly three terabytes - which will likely take at least three ~~weeks~~ months, if not more, to do. Sweet justice.


**TL; DR -** User error gets me screamed at by said user. Screamer has to re-upload almost three terabytes of data because he's an idiot.

my friend got this and was annoyed thinking that hackers had gotten control of h is account. it stopped posting after a month and all was seemingly forgotten.

But recently it started posting again(dont ask me why my friend didn't disable the app). Of course my other friend jumped in to mock him in the comments:

50sheckles,84,147,1mvxjr,650,"I worked for a relatively small remote tech support company. It was kind of a half-scam, boiler room telemarketing operation done with the use of encrypted VoIP and online merchant accounts, but we provided inbound support for everyone that paid us money and recorded all conversations so we could provide proof of customer satisfaction to the payment gateways in case anyone tried to do a charge-back after receiving support. Overall, we made sure all existing customers were getting what they paid for and happy with our work and most were. 

Only problem was that since we were avoiding charge-backs like the plague, a lot of times we had to do extra stuff for our customers. We had to make sure the customer was as happy as possible and that his/her satisfaction was crystal clear over the phone.

Most of our customers were some very strange characters.

One in particular was this one woman named Lisa. She's around 50-55 .
Every time she called us, she was wasted. Most likely we think she's blackout drunk. It's possible it could be something else. Meth is a close runner-up. Anyways, we have no idea what she's like sober.

This is a small snippet of what usually happens during a call with her:

Me: ""Ok Lisa, now I need you to type something in that box. are you ready?""

Lisa: ""yea I pressed ok""

Me: ""(!) No Lisa! Let's try this again! Look at your keyboard again. Do you see your keyboard?""

Lisa: ""yeah""

Me: ""Ok remember on the keyboard, on the lower left hand side, next to the C.T.R.L (saying it slowly) key.... do you see the C.T.R.L key Lisa?""

Lisa: ""yeah I see the start menu on the screen...""

Me: ""NO! Your keyboard! Look at your keyboard! The thing where you press buttons and the buttons you press shows up on the screen.""

Lisa: ""...................OH the keyboard! Right the keyboard! ok sorry go ahead""

Me: (Slow instructions to get her to open the 'run' box). ""ok lisa what do you see now""

Lisa: ""it says 'type the name of the program, folder....' (run box)""

Me: ""great! now DO NOT DO ANYTHING! ok Do... Not... Do.... Anything.... don't click 'ok'... I need you to type something in that box right next to 'Open.' Ok?""

Lisa: ""ok go ahead.""
Me: ""ok now type this in... www....... ok? W.W.W...... DOT....... [domain name]...... DOT.... net""

Lisa: ""ok should I press okay now?""

Me: ""NO!!!!!! Read back to me what it says!""

Lisa: ""www.domainname.net""

Me: [I don't trust her] ""Could you spell it out for me lisa? After WWW, did you put a 'DOT' after that?""
Lisa: ""Yeah it says dot""

[mfw she literally typed in wwwdotdomainnamedotnet] 

[spend the next 5 minutes trying to get her to locate the ""."" key on her keyboard.]

[fast forward 10 minutes...somehow get this drunken mongoloid connected because I'm Houdini]

Me: ""Well lisa I have no clue how I did it, but you are successfully connected to our technician's console"" 

Lisa: [babbling incoherently] 

Me: ""uh... we'll give you a call back once the work is done""

Lisa: ""Wait! Listen I want you to sign me up on the facebook. I want to start a facebook account! Where do I go to get one and is it free?""

Me: ""............""

[Conversation is being recorded. I can't just hang up or refuse service. If she decides to do a chargeback, the company's gateway is blocked and all money for the month is stuck for 6 months.]

Me: ""................ sure lisa. let's get you signed up on ""ze facebook""

[going through process of making facebook profile for her as she starts talking nonsense again]

Me: ""ok Lisa you're all set with your facebook""

[she mentions something about her daughter having a facebook and how she hasn't seen her in years]

Me: (since I start to feel bad for her and also to show her how to navigate around facebook as if she'll remember any of this tomorrow) ""What's your daughter's name? We'll find her on ze facebook!""

We go to her daughter's page, and she goes into shock. Apparently, she has a 2 year old grandson and she's never seen him before. There are tons of photos of this kid on her page. She starts crying as I'm navigating through all the photos.

[shaquille o'feel]

Because I know she'll never be able to get pack to this page without my help, I save all the pictures into a folder on her desktop.

She tells me she'll pay me whatever I want to have these pictures made for her and sent to her house. She cannot understand that she can do this herself. I tell her about FedEx/Kinkos.... nothing.

I decided I've had enough because not only do I feel conflicted about her proposal (on one hand, I do accept donations and I DID just help this insane person get her first look at her second grandson. On the other hand, 'holy shit! that's just fucked up that I would take her money for something like this!' 

Anyways, she was crying and thanking me and asking me to send her these pics. She was also flirting with me and asking me if I could send her a picture of me. It was getting way too weird at this point, so I just hung up the phone. I figured there was no way she would do a charge-back after this, and if she did, that's just something I'll gladly live with.

So there you have it, kids. This is just a tiny fraction of a typical call with her. Every moment is exactly like this. 

Did I also forget to mention that the whole time I'm trying to to help her, she is nonsensically babbling about nothing?

I've got tons of stories regarding Lisa. I'll stop here for now. Just thinking about handling her calls makes me want to physically hurt myself to distract from the memory.

So first of all some background, I work in a largeish (between 2000 and 3000 users) financial services firm - as 1st/2nd line support - the team takes anywhere from 90 to 200 calls a day and there are 6 of us on the team - we tend to concentrate on first-time-fix and we're pretty good at this achieving this. our users are generally pretty good (which is why this is the first time I've had to share)

So here we go with the first story.

    Hi Helpdesk

    $user in the london office isn't receiving the daily reports that I email to 
    him.  I don't get any bouncebacks or error messages and i can email
    other people without problem, and he receives email from my colleagues
     without any problems - could you have a look for me?

    kind regards

     &lt;$girl from upstairs&gt;


So, with the information at hand, I assume this is going to be a nice simple one to resolve and call $user - No answer and it goes to voicemail. I leave a nice message asking him to ring us as soon as possible, with my name and number.

I wait a for a couple of days with this call sat in my queue, and send him an email (after all, his emails are working from the details of the call)

    Hi $user,

    &lt;$girl from upsatirs&gt; has reported an issue with you receiving emails
    sent by her, and only her, could you call me back on &lt;$helpdesknumber&gt;
    when you're free? alternatively could you confirm your phone number 
    and let me know when you're free so we can resolve the issue

    Kind Regards

I wait for a few more days, email again with a very similar email - could you give me a ring/give me your current number/yada yada yada.

eventually, two weeks later leaving voicemails sending emails, asking his secretary to get him to ring us when free with this call having sat in my queue, and being out of SLA I decide enough is enough, time to get out the big guns and write another meek email

    to: $user

    with you not receiving some emails, however you have failed to reply 
    to any of our attempts to contact you, please could you get in touch 
    by the end of the week. If however, this is no longer an issue don't worry to
    respond and you call will be closed automatically.

    kind regards

    ch13fwiggum

I get an Out of Office message in reply, so feel it's only fair to wait another week before closing the call.

as was inevitable, I fail to receive any sort of contact back and close the call and don't worry about the issue ever again...

oh, how I had to bite my tongue - oh how I wanted to respond with a tirade of abuse for the self important little shit to read.

however I'm a coward, and $user is relatively important (probably not important enough to get me fired, but important enough that the operations director might hear of it) - so instead I granted myself access to his mailbox and spent approximately 4 minutes trying to find the reports, (including granting myself permissions to his mailbox) before I stumbled on a folder called ""daily reports"" 

Guess what was in there?

It's a pretty beefy machine (Core 2 Duo + Windows 7) compared to the old one (which had a Pentium 4 no-HT). I take a look at it and there's a newly bad capacitor. I image ANOTHER computer and bring it out, ensuring that there are absolutely NO bad components. It works for about a week at most. Repeat 1 more time. Finally, we get funding approved to buy the teacher a brand new computer (Intel i5, 8 GB RAM, even though we're standardized on 32-bit Windows 7... A waste...) and get that set up. Finally it works. I contacted the district that donated the large batch of machines to us to see why they donated them. Turns out they'd learned that the machines had capacitors that were of poor quality and liked to fail, so they replaced all the machines with new ones and donated the old ones to us.

thespike323,42,38,1mt32w,163,"Good afternoon TFTS. 

So, for the first six months of this year, I, a 3rd year CS student, was doing an internship at the helpdesk of an investment firm. Since this was a quantitative investment firm, they needed a large IT infrastructure, and had a large group of software developers working there as well. 

I was obviously the least experienced member of all the helpdesk staff, so while I would handle most of the tech support requests from the accounting, portfolio management, and compliance teams with relative ease, tickets from the software developers tended to be a little bit beyond my scope, and would get assigned to the more experienced members. 

One morning, however, I see a ticket from one of the devs requesting an extra hard drive (he needed local copies of databases for a lot of his code), and to adjust his partitions so that C: would take up one drive, while D: would take up the extra one. Now, I had never done this before, but when I found out how intuitive Windows Disk Management looked, I figured I could tackle this ticket. Assigned it to myself, grabbed an HD from our supply closet, and strode bravely towards the dev group. 

I arrived and told Dev Guy I was there to get him all set up with the new drive. He seemed surprised. Surely they would've sent one of the full-timers to help with this. But alas, there stood the intern, fresh drive in hand. 

He shuts down, I crack open his PC case, pop in the drive, boot up. All good so far. He logs in, I open up Disk Management. New drive shows up, no partitions on it. Sweet. First things first, let's get rid of the D: partition on his original drive. 

Uh oh. 

The option to delete the partition is grayed out. 

Crap. 

I start thinking I may have gotten in a little over my head, but I wasn't about to back down without a fight. And unfortunately for my opponents, I have a black belt in Google-fu. Scan the search results, and boom. My answer. You can't delete a partition with a pagefile. 

So I get into advanced system settings, and see pagefiles in both C: and D: partitions. Pop the one from D: over to C:, and there it is: I can delete the D: partition. 

Nuke D:, extend C:, create a new D: on drive B. Dev Guy pulls his backup of D: off the networked storage location, and everything is running smoothly. There I was, a degree-less intern standing triumphant over the corpse of ticket from someone vastly more experienced than I was. It's hard to put into words how I felt. Dev Guy thanks me. I welcome him.

I work in a Nursing Home/Rehab facility. Because of our relatively small staff, a lot of us have extra responsibilities, and IT falls on my shoulders. Probably because they couldn't find another sucker.

Today's ""What the fuck is *wrong* with you?!"" comes not from our CNAs (who aren't really expected to be the pinnacle of human achievement, to be honest) nor our regular nursing staff. Today, the Supervisor's office had a fuckup. Whoopee. And the supervisor in question is one of our ""I shouldn't have to know computers to do Nursing!"" types. Double whoopee.

Me: OK, let me transfer you to my cordless, and I can check my voicemail.

CAH: No, no. You need to come up here and resolve this problem!

(My office is on the first floor, and the supervisor's office is on the fifth. Our elevators suck, so I'm not really feeling like walking up four floors at 4 PM)

Me: Right. OK, what's the issue?

CAH: You need to come up here right away!

Me: But what's the **issue**?

CAH: Our fax machine isn't working!

(Wonderful. We use crappy old intellifax 2820s, which break down almost every week. The fact that none of the staff cleans them between toners doesn't help in the slightest)

Me: OK. What does it say on the front panel?

CAH: Hold on, let me go check...(some crashing noises are heard as she makes her away over to it.) It says ""Paper jam. Please remove paper jam.""

Me: Right. OK, I would recommend solving this issue by clearing the paper jam.

CAH: I tried that already, and it's not working! Come up here and fix it for me!

Me: Tell me what you've done while trying to fix it.

CAH: I've done everything it says on the panel! Come up!

Me: Tell me what steps you've taken to resolve this issue.

CAH: I've done **everything**! Come up here!

Me: First tell me what steps you've taken to resolve the issue.

CAH: You're making this too hard! Why can't you just come up here?

Me: Because it takes at least ten minutes to actually get up there unless I take the stairs. I also need to know what tools to bring. (bullshit, I know. All you need for a jam is some ingenuity and tweezers.) So, again. Please tell me what steps you've taken to resolve this issue.

CAH: I, uh. Hold on, let me do it again (Bingo!) OK, it says to remove the drum to clear the jam. I opened the cover, and there's this black thing...

Me: The drum and toner.

CAH: Yes, the drum and toner. I removed them by uh...

ladyithis,8,14,1msutx,55,"Here's a couple stories of how I get to help my in-laws with their computer problems.  Because I was a Computer Science major, I became tech support for my in-laws. 

So one weekend, about 8 years ago, when we went to visit them, my mother-in-law was complaining that their computer was running very slowly. I told her I'd take a look at it. I sit down at the computer, and when XP was finally done booting up, I did what I thought best at the time: ran a couple free malware removal programs and ran defrag. I noticed there were some toolbars installed on IE, so I got rid of those. My in-laws don't use their computer for a whole lot (checking email, mostly), so I'm really wondering what sites they're going to that installs so much malware.  Then I saw one of those pop-up blocker programs installed, and on the blacklist was a long list of adult sites. Oh, so that's probably what's been installing all the malware. I wasn't sure how best to approach the subject with my in-laws, so I suggested to my husband that he talk to his dad about it, and then I told my in-laws later to be careful about the sites they visit on the internet.  

Sometime later, my mother-in-law tells me about this program she bought to stop spyware, but she needed help with it. I started it up, and it's a program to hold various account information and passwords. Erm. I didn't know if it was trusted software or not, but I told her that it didn't appear to actually protect again spyware and that it was a program for storing passwords. I cautioned her against using it, and she was disappointed that she wasted her money on it. 

A couple years later (after Vista was released, but before Win7), their computer finally died. Fortunately, they had the foresight to get an external drive and properly back-up all their important files. They picked up a new computer from the big warehouse store, and when we visited, my mother-in-law asks if I can ""install the other Windows"". I asked her what she meant, and she wanted me to install XP onto their new computer instead of Vista that was already on there because she had heard that ""Vista wasn't very good"". I just shook my head and told her that Vista was fine for what she needed to use it for (checking her email). 

A couple months after they got their new computer, my mother-in-law says she needs some help with the new computer they just bought. Apparently there's something wrong with the screen and half of it goes dark. She's upset because she just bought the computer and it's already broken. I told her I'd look at it when we visited next. So when we got there, I had an idea of what was ""going dark"" on her screen, but wanted to make sure it wasn't legitimately broken. I moved the mouse over to the right side of the screen and the gadget bar popped up. I asked her, ""Is this what you're talking about?"" and she says, ""Yes!"" I explained what the gadget bar was, and then we proceeded to fill it up with the weather reports of all the cities family members lived in. 

Fortunately, I haven't had any help requests since then. It helps that I don't encourage them to buy any new technology :)

**TL;DR**: My in-laws aren't terrible users, just casual and naive users. :)

I corrected her about what double spacing meant and ran the spell check, spamming the ""Change"" button to get rid of them. The entire thing was still only half fixed of her double spacing when the spell check decided it was too much and just reported the document as error free.

I told her it would probably be fine to turn in now rather than fix them all manually. She also was not sure how to save to her usb drive.

PolloMagnifico,45,70,1msf62,337,"So, if you're curious, I decided to scrap the previous story because, honestly, it really isn't funny and is just me bitching. And nobody wants to hear that. But what I am gonna do is give you a little insight into my job.

So we get a call from one of our clients who operate a warehouse. As such, it's dingy and dusty and definitely not the place to load up with high quality laptops. So naturally that's all they have. We cycle through every laptop there every couple of months for dusting and overheating issues. So when a ticket came in that someones USB port wasn't working, we assumed the worst.

So go through the standard stuff, make sure it isn't an overheating issue (SOP for this particular client). Nope, everything is working fine. MAchine is fine, just isn't seeing the USB port.

So I go and talk to someone, as this is my first run in with this particular issue with this particular company. Ask them if I need to handle it under warranty or just bring it in and fix it myself. They say warranty.

Time to call Smell tech support.

They tell me they'll take it under warranty, but it needs to be sent in, which means a 6 week turn around (they say less, but we know). I relay the info, get it authorized, and call Smell again.

NOW they insist on getting a system diagnostics. Facepalm.

No problem. Tell the onsite guy to bring me the laptop next time he's there. A few days later, he goes out, looks at the system, and doesn't bring it back. But he tells me it obviously got dropped.

Well, not in warranty, Smell won't cover it due to damage. I spend the next week trying to get SOMEONE to make a decision on it. I do some research and discover that the USB port is on a daughterboard. Relay this information to my boss (read: owner of the company), tell him the cable probably came loose when it got dropped. This is the exact response I got to that.

&gt; Yeah... laptops don't do that.

I... I don't... *what*?

So I fire off small novel of a response, complete with links to six different sites and all the options that included replacing the cable, the daughterboard, the motherboard, along with pictures, documentation, and so on and so forth.

&gt;Yeah, ok, whatever. We'll get it in and you can take it apart. Not like it's under warranty anyway.

Finally get our onsite guy to bring it in. Open it up. Yup, cable came loose. Reconnect cable. Rebuild laptop. Test. Works. Took me a little over an hour. Charged the company more.

We have a few security guards that have a computer strictly for email. I don't expect too much from them computer-wise and usually have no problems. Except for one. Special Officer Doofy. (SOD from here on out) I get a call from a user letting me know that *she* got a call from SOD saying his password didn't work. Why he didn't call me directly is beyond me; he's called plenty before. A nice easy ticket for a nice slow morning. If I only knew...

I start off by resetting his password in AD and unlocking the account and give him a call to let him know.

Me - Good morning SOD, I reset your password. It's Password01, (spell it out for him) and as soon as you use it you'll have to pick a new one that needs to be at least 8 characters long, have one each upper and lower case, at least one special character, and it can't be the same as a previous password or have your username in it.

SOD - Okay, I'll do that right now. *clickyclicky* It says invalid password.

Me - Okay, you typed capital P, lower case a-s-s-w-o-r-d zero one, correct?

SOD - Let me try again. *clickyclicky* Nope.

Me - Can you tell me what you're typing as you enter it?

SOD - *clicky* zero *clicky* one. yeah, it didn't take it.

Me - O.o Okay, you have to actually type out the word ""password"". Make sure you use a capital P.

SOD - Ohh, I thought you were telling me my password was zero one!

Me - *Why in the world would I spell it out then?!*

SOD - It doesn't like my new password.

Me - Is it 8 or more characters long?

SOD - Yes

Me - One each upper and lower case?

SOD - Yes

Me - One special character like a dollar sign or pound sign?

SOD - Yes

Me - Not the same as a previous password?

SOD - Nope

Me - Doesn't include your username?

SOD - Nope

Me - *screw protocol* What password are you trying to use?

SOD - $*Username*

Me - ... You can't have your username in it. Pick something else that doesn't have your username.

SOD - Ohh! Okay. *clickyclickyclicky* Nope, still not working.

Play2Tones,2,9,1ms5d3,44,"Working for a manufacturer, tech support is a little different.  We're one of the good ones, so our TS gets wide acclaim from users for being helpful, as we actually try to help (and speak English as a primary language).  It's also because the service provider doesn't really understand much, hasn't used our product, and it isn't covered in their contract, so they won't do anything to help.

Now, the equipment I support is IP based, and needs to communicate with the client server, which requires configuration.  If the user doesn't configure the device properly, it doesn't function, and then I get an email saying they can't get it to work.  Our equipment can produce logs showing the configuration, and events such as error responses.  For that reason, a phone call will not resolve the issue, only a log file.  A generic email saying it doesn't work will not resolve the issue either.

This leads to hilarious complaints (which are magnified because of our high resolution rate), such as we didn't resolve the issue promptly.  I'm sorry, but if I ask you for a log after you tell me there's a problem and you don't send it for a week (if at all), I can't start to fix your issue.

My favorite complaint is about troubleshooting.  Since every client has a different type of server (really it comes down to 5 big name manufacturers), and a different configuration, the details populated in our product are unknown to me.  I usually ask if they have another device working, and to describe that setup, so I can compare.  After trying a few variations on the configuration, I almost always get it to work (most of the time they're doing it wrong), except when a bug is discovered and I must yield to DEV's.  So if they complain that the trial and error phase took to long, I really want to say:

""it's your site and you should know the pertinent details to configure this, you're lucky we're so helpful/I'm so persistent""

But I usually say: ""you should write this down for next time, I'm just glad we got this to work today"" -cue shit eating ""have a nice day""

I'm not a service provider, the only reason we try so hard is because of the potential for future sales at the same site.  I have a copy of the log they sent, so I can know what they did wrong in the future.  Don't treat me like a mind-reader, and I won't tell you I'm coming up empty.  And don't make the same mistake twice, or you will be subject to the same delays twice.

TL;DR If you expect a manufacturer to know your specific setup details before you share them, troubleshooting is going to take a loooooong time","Sure, I will remember your specific details",53
lawndartcatcher,14,43,1ms2l6,219,"I work for a company that makes software for use in the public safety sphere. Field users enter data in mobile units and when the units come back to headquarters (and are within range of a WAP) the software synchronizes data across the various mobile databases and the master database on the server. Occasionally our UI will also be installed on the server if it's a really small organization and they have limited hardware.

Usually issues with synchronization are caused by a network issue - either a firewall has gotten itself turned on (by the network gremlins) or a machine isn't connected to the wireless network (once one wasn't connected because they'd shipped the vehicle that the mobile unit was on to a repair place two states away and left it in the vehicle). So when we get the ""it hasn't synched in two weeks"" we usually recommend they call their local IT folks to straighten the network issues out, but sometimes it doesn't hurt to verify it from our end, especially since a lot of times these organizations' IT departments are ""absentee parents"" and leave a lot of this stuff to folks who aren't ""computer people"".

Client: ""Yeah. We turn it off when we're not using it.""

Me: ""So...the computer you're trying to synchronize with is physically powered off?""

Client: ""You think that may be the problem?""

Me: ""Well, it's gotta be turned on and connected to the internet when you try to synch, so that might be an issue.""

Client: ""I'll go turn it on and I'll give you a call if we still can't synch""

They talk to an Apache Tomcat server that feeds content and scheduling. This same server is used to upload and schedule new content.

&gt;(8:31 PM) XYZ Corp 

&gt;Welcome to Derp Training Services! 
You are receiving this information because you recently purchased Derp online training. In most cases you may access your training within 15-30 minutes after your order is processed; however, in some cases, it could take up to 24 hours.

&gt;Customer Number: *redacted*

&gt;Order Number: *redacted* 

&gt;Number of people who may access this training: 5

&gt;Access expiration date: 09/04/2014

&gt;(8:31 PM) I want to know how I managed to receive this email

&gt;**You said ...**
(8:32 PM) Sir, do you work for XYZ Corp?

&gt;**Contact said ...**

&gt;(8:33 PM) Yes

&gt;(8:33 PM) But I never purchased any training

&gt;**You said ...**

&gt;(8:35 PM) It appears that someone within your company purchased the training and redeemed it for you. It is very possible that it was something that your supervisor wants you to take, but I honestly couldn't say. All I can see is what you have given to me, the order and customer numbers. Based off those, it tells me that you (your email anyway) have redeemed one of the 5 training courses on that order.

&gt;**Contact said ...**

&gt;(8:36 PM) No that is completely incorrect and don't make statements that you have no evidence to support.

&gt;(8:37 PM) I want you to find out what email address the order came from.

&gt;(8:38 PM) and then forward me that email

&gt;**You said ...**

&gt;(8:38 PM) All I am saying is that someone purchased training and redeemed one of the 5 trainings for you and created an account for you, which has your information on it. I can only assume that it is someone from your company that purchased the training, but as I stated before, I can not be sure.

&gt;(8:39 PM) Unfortunately, I would not have access to that information. The only email that I can see is the one that was used to redeem the training: not.me@xyz.com

&gt;(8:39 PM) I would recommend contacting onlinetraining@derp.com, as they are the ones who handle the purchasing of courses. They may be able to tell you who purchased the training.

He then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes when I basically said, ""I haven't heard from you in a while. Due to no response, I am ending this chat. Please contact us again if you still need assistance.""

Apparently, when I apply logic to my job, I have no idea what I am talking about.

PapBear,8,14,1mqhoa,57,"Background: So I do work-study at my university in IT, the tech support desk, dealing with the silly students and faculty and their ineptitude, and we also transfer people who call the main line. This is my second year doing it, and I finally have something I remembered to share with yall. Here goes.

**How'd he die? aka the weirdest call ever**

This old guy called a few minutes ago. He said he went.

Me: &lt;School name here&gt;, how can I help you?

Old Guy: Yes, I went to the school a long time ago, and I saw where &lt;known faculty member&gt; passed. Do you know how he died?

(*I'd just found out the dude died from a friend of mine who was going to a Mass service on campus a couple of hours ago. I'd never met the guy or talked to him. Awkwardness ensures*)

Me: Well sir, uh..please hold.

I tell the other guy here at the helpdesk, Bob, about the guy, and we talked about how weird it was, and that it was kind of strange and maybe inappropriate.

The phone icon was flashing the whole time. I let it sit there. I didn't want to transfer him to anyone, since the guy just died, and I didn't want to answer and inform him that I didn't know, because then he might expect me to go find, which ~~would be reasonable~~ **wasn't going to happen**.

It sits there a little longer, and my supervisor comes back to the helpdesk. I relay the info to him, and he takes the call, talks the guy, and ends the conversation.

IT Soup: ""I handled it.""

Me: ""Good, now I can share the story!""

**Desktop-Side Breakdown**

This one happened about an hour ago, and I felt bad for the lady, and it was pretty sad.

Lady, mid-40s looking, comes up to the desk for help and asks if one of us could help her find a lost file. I volunteer too since her face was familiar and she looked like a nice lady. I sit down, and she's visibly stressing.

She says that she has some big project due in a couple of hours, and that she was trying to fix it (remove part of the table in Word) but she deleted a good chunk of her work. I look at it, pull over the keyboard and ""Ctrl+z"". Everything comes back as it was. A good 1000+ words were highlighted.

Me: ""Is this what went missing?""

Sad Lady: ""yes...""

At this point she grabs my arms and starts quietly sobbing. She thanked me a couple of times for saving her work, that'd she been writing since about 8am. She saved it, in 3 different places, and she talked some more. I just sat and listened.

She talked about she's trying to focused on her schoolwork, and then something about being old. She says her mom just passed, and cries a bit more. It's getting more sad now, and I just do the soft back pat.

She talks a little more, and cries a little more, and tried to say some soothing words.

(*Plus or minus a few words, but the essence is accurate*)

Me: ""The way I look at humans, we're just dirt, energy, and a spirit. The energy transfer, the dirt changes form, but the spirit never dies. Her spirit is always there. You can see her in the cool breeze, in a flower, in a bird in the sky. You'll be fine, it just takes time.""

She said some more thank yous, and talked some more, and I excused myself and came back to the helpdesk. Great now I'm a little sad again.

muzeofmobo,41,88,1mqg0x,378,"Hi all, long time listener first time caller.

Today I learned a lesson that I'm sure many of you discovered a long time ago. Some things, however, need to be learned the hard way.

About two weeks ago a ticket showed up in our bucket from a user in our call center complaining that her computer kept freezing to the point where she had to restart 4 or 5 times a day. The computers in the call center frequently get used by multiple users and can end up pretty messy, so the first thing I did was remote into her computer after she had left for the day (The call center employees are busy and stringently tracked on their productivity, so we don't like to ask them to stop working for us to fix things. This is important later.) and run a defrag (26% fragmented, ugh) and Ccleaner, delete old profiles, etc.

I left her a voicemail explaining what I had done and asking her to let me know if anything had changed. Sure enough, I get a call from her the next morning because it had frozen again. She had already restarted, so I asked her to leave it frozen the next time it happened and to call me so that I could look at what processes were running and so on, in order to pinpoint the issue. What followed was a  frustrating game of phone tag that can be summed up with a quick recap of a couple voicemails I had waiting for me after lunch one of those days. Let me preface this by saying that she was a very pleasant lady, just really busy and under the gun.

VM 1, 1:20 PM ""Hi Muze, it's User again, my computer locked up and you told me to call you when it happened again, I haven't restarted yet. Please call me back.""

VM 2, 1:24 PM ""Hi Muze, sorry I had to restart and get back to work, I'll let you know the next time it happens.""

And so it went. After a week of this, I just said 'screw it' and decided to reimage her computer. I prepped a new drive, imaged it, installed all of her apps, and copied all of her data from her current machine. One quick drive swap and log in later, she was up, running, and happy.

Until today.

""Hi Muze, my computer locked up again! Is this user error? Help!""

So I called, discovered to my great relief that she hadn't restarted yet, and ran upstairs to check it out. When I got there, she was busily entering data into a form as a customer gave it to her over the phone.

Me: ""Ah crud. You had to restart, huh?""
Her: ""No! I left it just the way it was. It's still locked up. See?""

And then she pointed to the ""Loading"" spinner on an IE tab. The web page she was trying to access wouldn't load.",Never trust the Problem Description.,466
