puhpow,4,0,1r0cxy,5,"Light confuses me and I was hoping someone could help clear up a few questions I had.

So nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. And the closer something does travel to the speed of light, the slower time goes relative to that object. Is this correct? So theoretically, if something travels faster than the speed of light, this object would travel back in time. I was hoping someone could explain to me why light and time are directly related.

I believe my confusion arises because I find myself comparing light to sound. For example, if someone fires a gun, it takes time before that sound reaches you. If you outrun the sound, you will not hear the gunshot for a second, but it doesn't mean the gunshot never happened.

Why is it different for light? Using a similar example, if a star explodes, it takes time before that light reaches you. I would assume that if you outran the light, it would only mean that you wouldn't see that happen for a bit, and not that you were outrunning the event itself.

&gt; A collection of galaxies that is a whopping four billion light years long is the biggest cosmic structure ever seen. The group is roughly one-twentieth the diameter of the observable universe – *big enough to challenge a principle dating back to Einstein, that, on large scales, the universe looks the same in every direction.* 

- NewScientist in summary of a paper from Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, DOI: 10.1093/mnras/sts497

There is on the flip side another paper ""Seeing patterns in noise: Gigaparsec-scale `structures' that do not violate homogeneity"" (arXiv:1306.1700 [astro-ph.CO] [[Link](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.1700v2.pdf)]) which states in the abstract:

&gt; If true, this would represent a serious challenge to the standard cosmological model. However, the homogeneity scale is an average property which is not necessarily affected by the discovery of a single large structure. I clarify this point and provide the first fractal dimension analysis of the DR7 quasar catalogue to demonstrate that it is in fact homogeneous above scales of at most 130 Mpc/h, which is much less than the upper limit for \Lambda CDM. In addition, I show that the algorithm used to identify the Huge-LQG regularly finds even larger clusters of points, extending over Gpc scales, in explicitly homogeneous simulations of a Poisson point process with the same density as the quasar catalogue. This provides a simple null test to be applied to any cluster thus found in a real catalogue, and suggests that the interpretation of LQGs as `structures' is misleading.

Has the discovery of U1.27 actually cast any doubt on the cosmological principle, is there actually any serious debate on this subject, and are there any additional resources that may cast light on the subject?

Correct?

2) Having 30% carboxyhemoglobin would result in the same maximum on a graph of pO2 vs % O2 saturation, but it would lose the sigmodal shape and be left-shifted (more affinity for O2 as the CO2 will not unbind, allosteric interaction keeps O2 bound).

3) While in #2 the level of saturation would remain the same, in a graph of pO2 vs ml O2/100 ml blood, the maximum amount of O2/100 ml would only be 70% that of someone with the same amount of Hgb in their blood.

I was hoping that someone would be able to explain this in relatively simple terms, and provide some insight into how this functions to the benefit of the distribution of primes.

My basic understanding thus far is that the Riemann Zeta function is deeply tied to the prime number theorem - and that the prime number theorem essentially states that the distribution of prime numbers is greater as the number of considered integers, 'n', becomes increasingly large. I also know that the PNT has a predictive capability of the form 1/(ln(x)) which becomes more accurate as 'n' becomes large.

Poddster,3,0,1qja8u,8,"When explaining the concept of number bases other than decimal to someone else (e.g. binary, octal, hex), I suddenly thought about the notion of *bitwise operators* and if they exist in other number systems. Naturally I didn't let that thought be part of the explanation, as I didn't want to confuse. 

So now I get to confuse you, ask science. 

3 examples of bitwise operators are `AND`, `OR` and `XOR`.  An example of their use:

|AND | 0 | 1  |
|---|--|---|       
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |       

|OR | 0 | 1  |
|---|--|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

|XOR | 0 | 1  |
|---|--|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

(similar to a multiplication table or an addition table).


The question is: Does such a concept of bitwise (or I suppose digit-wise) operator exist in other base systems? Are there any operations in decimal that operate across pairs of digits in equal-length numbers? What about any other exotic bases?

Note: I'm not talking about doing something you might see in programming languages, e.g. in C `244 | 1` or `0x100 &amp; 0xFFF`, as those decimal and hexadecimal literal operands are still operated on in terms of binary bitwise operators, rather than in terms of decimal or hexdecimal digitwise operators. They're simply 'converted' to binary first (in as much as they're never not binary in a computer system, but I hope you get my drift)

So in decimal:

|??? | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 
|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0  | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |

I also realize that an electron only has a probability to exist in a given position, spin, orbital, shape, etc.  That being said, Newtonian physics tells us that planets stay in orbit because there are two components to their motion- a tangential velocity component, and a radial acceleration.  We're the radial forces (gravity) to be turned off, the planet would fly off in a straight line, and were the tangential velocity stopped, the planet would fall directly into the other body.  

So, with electrons, we know there is an attractive force due to the negative charge of electron and the positive charge of the proton.  Also, although the mass is negligible, perhaps at these minute distances there is a radial gravitational force. So that makes two radial forces.  Additionally, these things are zipping around extremely fast- a tangential component perhaps.  So what's all the confusion about? Have I just solve the conundrum and resolved the differences between quantum mechanics and classical physics?  What is inherently wrong about this analysis?

Side question- just learned about the shape of sub orbitals, and besides the ""s"" orbital, they seem to jut out to the side of the nucleus.  So does this mean the other orbitals do not actually orbit (as in go completely around) the nucleus, merely hover in their given space?

john_alan,4,0,1qg0bz,2,"Hi,

I've been wondering about this for a while, let's take say a simple iPhone application, like the contacts app.

It's just a scrollable table full of names. I understand how this is composed, a table view that's supplied an array of names, and I understand the app is informed of events like touches and scroll gestures.

My question:

I've seen basic source code for these kind of apps and my question is, when they are idle (ie. no touch events/ gesture events to handle) are they in a constant loop polling for events?

To explain why i'm asking lets take some examples,


1) A simple c app that adds two ints, and is written entirely in the main function willl add two numbers and end instantly.

2) If I write an app that has a never ending **for** loop, it will ramp one of my cpu cores up to 100%

3) All applications end, unless they are in some kind of loop

So to my question,

Why are iPhone apps/desktop apps that are totally idle not eating up an entire core of cpu as they blisteringly loop as fast as possible though source code?


In the iOS app source I mentioned above I can't even see a loop, it's just a load of methods, so why doesn't it just end as soon as it reaches the end of it's ""main"" and if it is infact looping continuously how come it uses basically ZERO cpu unlike my never ending for loop which is also looping forever?

NingPoHo,2,1,1qf5cd,1,"Dear Science Experts, 

This may be obvious, but I’ve pondered this question for a long time and have never found a satisfactory answer.  The Hubble Ultra Deep Sky View caught images of proto galaxies forming 13.2 billions years ago.  Wiki states that the best measurement of the age of the universe is 13.798±0.037 billion years (elsewhere 15-20 billion years) since the Big Bang.  We can find this is by correlating the redshift of different galaxies with their distance from earth, then calculate backwards to a point of origin in time.  Granted there are other ways to estimate the age of the universe (such as analyzing the cosmic background radiation left over from the Big Bang) so my question is limited to visual astronomy.

Here’s my problem.  Common sense tells us that the earth is not the center of the universe or the big bang, although we’re not on the edge of it, either.  Wouldn’t looking back 13.2 billion light years in one direction imply a radius of far greater width?  What happens to the age of the universe if we add the distance to the edge of the universe in the opposite direction?

Pluvialis,6,5,1qc6h1,14,"Is there a hard dividing line between gas and liquid, in principle?

I was thinking about the inhaling in space question someone asked earlier and got to wondering about water evaporating in a vacuum again (as you do).

As I understand it, liquid water sits in my saucepan because, although the molecules are 'loose', they don't have enough energy to overpower the Earth's atmospheric pressure. That's why in a vacuum liquid water will immediately evaporate. One might naively hypothesise that gravity would keep it in, but in fact it's only atmospheric pressure that normally maintains a liquid phase. I hope I'm right so far.

So if I had water vapour in a canister or something, and slowly compressed it, eventually I'd get a canister of liquid water. But how would it transition? Would a pool of water, or droplets, i.e. something with a surface, slowly form? If so, why? What would happen if you expanded it again slowly? Wouldn't the water molecules all just gradually get further and further apart, belying the distinction we normally make between gas and liquid?

For some reason that image seems wrong, but I don't know why it shouldn't happen. I feel like probably it would instead 'boil'. But which one is it, and why?

EDIT: Bonus question (I don't know if that's allowed but...) - How much do atmospheric gas molecules simply follow free-falling trajectories, versus being jostled about by neighbouring gaseous molecules? Would a molecule of oxygen fly up from the surface of the Earth, slowing down until gravity pulls it back down, or does it just get smacked about a relatively smaller volume by other molecules?

So far, I've done the math, applying the boundary conditions to get the displacement as a function of x and t:

&gt; y(x,t) =  Σ(n→∞) A*sin(nπx/L) *e^iωt

Where A and ω are also dependent on n (I can't seem to get subscripts to work).

For initial conditions, I assume that the string is going to be plucked, and so ∂y/∂t = 0 for all x at t=0, and y(x,0) will look something like this:

 http://i.imgur.com/8is1rXG.png

Where h is the displacement where the string is plucked, L is the length of the string, and aL is the location where the string is plucked (so a is some number between 0 and 1).

I worked out what the amplitudes A should be using Fourier analysis. I won't write out the formula for the amplitudes because it's kind of messy, but I'm pretty sure I've got it right, because here is what I get for a string of length 10, displaced by 1 unit when plucked in the middle (first 32 modes):

But now I'm wondering, how do I translate all of this into sound? Do I have to do a separate calculation in order to figure out how air might be displaced by the sound board of the guitar? 

Or would it be a sufficient approximation to calculate the fundamental angular frequency, ω1=k1c=πc/2L, plus those of (say) the first 31 overtones, and just add together sinusoids of those frequencies to get the final sound wave?

And if so, which sinusoidal functions should I use? My time-dependent function is e^iωt. Should I just use the real part of that (i.e., cos(ωt))?

""The standard redox voltage per electron for carbon dioxide splitting is 1.33V at 25oC/1 atm.  The thermoneutral voltage is about 1.47V, which is nearly the same as that for water electrolysis.  When the Ohmic losses are added to thermoneutral voltage, a cell voltage of about 2 V or more is generally required to drive the reaction in aqueous electrolytes.""

Example: my computer with an LCD monitor consumes on average 200W.

Most of the electric energy consumption transfers ""directly"" into heat energy.

But some of the energy output is of course electromagnetic (light from the monitor), sound from the speakers and fans, mechanical (vibrations, HDD platters etc) and magnetic (motors/fans) etc.

Light from the monitor, sound waves, and mechanical vibrations would all transfer into heat energy eventually, or am I wrong?

shffldrllshn,8,2,1q65qd,3,"Hello /r/askscience! 

I'm working on my lab report for the experiments we've performed at school the past couple of weeks. We've been measuring carotenoid content of zucchini by using HPLC. I'm having trouble reading my HPLC results. 

So, we have set standards of lutein, b-carotene and lycopene (lycopene won't be found in zucchini) as our reference data, and three samples in duplo of varying concentrations of extracted carotenoids which we want to measure. In theory it should be simple to interpret the results: I measure the standards on HPLC, the peaks on the graph should represent the three carotenoids in the solution. Since I know the concentrations that have been used for the standards, I'm able to determine the concentration for unknown samples for these carotenoids by looking at the Area volume beneath the peak (and performing calculations). Simple enough, surely?

Now here's my problem: My peaks are all messed up. A couple of peaks flow into eachother, and I'm not sure how to interpret that or how to do any calculations with it, considering the area volume will be partially from both peaks. Is it possible to just use the peak height to do the concentration calculation? But even if that is possible, how do I interpret which peak is the correct peak? 

If anyone cares enough to help me, here's a couple of the results I have:
[1. Standards](http://www.filedump.net/index.php?pic=hplc13standards1islutein2isbcaratone3islycopene1383909011.pdf)
[2. Standards](http://www.filedump.net/index.php?pic=hplc53standards1383909011.pdf)
[3. Sample 1](http://www.filedump.net/index.php?pic=hplc2sample1highconc1383909011.pdf)

In those sample files, the first big peak is supposed to be lutein, the second b-carotene and the third is lycopene. Now if I start comparing the standards to the samples, the first peak (lutein) seems pretty obvious as it's always at roughly the same retention time. If I start looking at the second peak, however, there seems to be a big difference in retention time of those peaks. I know b-carotene is in zucchini, but why are these peaks so far apart between the standards and samples then? 

I'm first trying to solve this problem... after that, maybe someone could tell me how to interpret that last small peak that shows up in the sample &gt;.&gt; is there anything I can say about that in my report, other than ''there's a peak, there should be something there but I don't know what the hell it is.''?

Sgroh87,4,0,1q4knv,4,"The way I understand it, our ears can only hear one sound at a time, at least in an abstract sense. Our ears pick up a combination of fundamentals and harmonics, some providing constructive or destructive interference, and the unique combination of this interference is why a saxophone sounds like a saxophone and a trumpet sounds like a trumpet.

But why is it that I can listen to an orchestra or a band and I'm able to hear the cello as a distinct entity in the performance? Why can I listen to a rock song when the bass and guitar are playing the same lines an octave apart, I can tell the bass apart from the guitar?

So do all the orbitals upwards have a similar issue like the p vs s orbital where the p orbital has only part of the ""dumbbell"" shape because part of it is covered by the s orbital?

Principally, I am interested in resonance. I have read that points of resonance correspond to unstable particles in scattering diagrams, but am not quite sure what that means in this case.

Also, refraction. What would it mean for a quantum wave to be refracted - if that would have any meaning at all?
