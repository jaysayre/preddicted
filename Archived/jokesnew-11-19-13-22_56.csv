""Well, for some time now, I thought my wife was having an affair and that each day on her lunch hour she'd bring her lover home to our 25th floor apartment and have sex with him. So today I was going to come home too, and catch them. Well, I got there and busted in, and immediately began searching for this guy. My wife was half-naked and yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. But, damn it, I couldn't find him! Just when I was about to give up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips ! The nerve of that guy to think he could hide from me! Well, I ran out there and promptly stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But, wouldn't you know it, he landed in some bushes that broke his fall, and he didn't die. This got me even more enraged so I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him, which turned out to be the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony and heaved it over the side. It plummeted 25 stories and crushed him !

The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.""

The angel sat back and thought for a moment.

Technically, the guy DID have a bad day. So he announced, ""OK, sir, welcome to the kingdom of heaven,"" and let him in. A few seconds later the next guy came up. ""OK, here's the rule. Before I can let you in, I need to hear about the day you died.""

""Sure thing,"" the next man replied. ""But you're not going to believe this. I was out on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises when I got a little carried away and accidentally fell over the side! Luckily I was able to catch myself by my fingertips on the balcony directly beneath mine, when, all of a sudden, this crazy man came running out of his apartment and started cussing and stomping on my fingers! Well, of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes on the way down which broke my fall so I didn't die right away. As I lay there face up on the ground, unable to move and in excruciating pain, I saw the man push his refrigerator, of all things, over the ledge and it fell directly on top of me and killed me ! ""

The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. ""Very well, "" he announces. ""Welcome to the kingdom of heaven, "" and lets the man enter.

A few seconds later a third man comes up to the gate. ""Tell me about the day you died,"" says the angel.
""OK, picture this,"" says the man. ""I'm naked inside a refrigerator. . . """,Its a small small world..,28

MoralLesson,6,70,1qvop2,164,"There was this male engineer, on a cruise ship in the Caribbean for the first time. It was wonderful, the experience of his life. He was being waited on hand and foot. But, it did not last. A Hurricane came up unexpectedly. The ship went down almost instantly.

The man found himself, he knew not how, swept up on the shore of an island. There was nothing else anywhere to be seen. No people, no supplies, nothing. The man looked around. There were some bananas and coconuts, but that was it. He was desperate, and forlorn, but decided to make the best of it. So for the next four months he ate bananas, drank coconut juice and mostly looked to the sea mightily for a ship to come to his rescue.

One day, as he was lying on the beach stroking his beard and looking for a ship, he spotted movement out of the corner of his eye. Could it be true, was it a ship? No, from around the corner of the island came this row-boat. In it was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen, or at least seen in 4 months. She was tall, tanned, and her blond hair flowing in the sea breeze gave her an almost ethereal quality. She spotted him also as he was waving and yelling and screaming to get her attention. 

She rowed her boat towards him. In disbelief, he asked, ""Where did you come from? How did you get here?"" 

She said, ""I rowed from the other side of the island. I landed on this island when my cruise ship sank."" 

""Amazing"", he said, ""I didn't know anyone else had survived. How many of you are there? Where did you get the row-boat? You must have been really lucky to have a row-boat wash-up with you?"" 

""It is only me"", she said, ""and the row-boat didn't wash up, nothing else did.""

""Well then"", said the man, ""how did you get the row-boat?"" 

""I made the row-boat out of raw material that I found on the island"", replied the woman. ""The oars were whittled from Gum tree branches, I wove the bottom from Palm branches, and the sides and stern came from a Eucalyptus tree""

""But, but,"" asked the man, ""what about tools and hardware, how did you do that?""

""Oh, no problem"", replied the woman, ""on the south side of the island there is a very unusual strata of alluvial rock exposed. I found that If I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into forgeable ductile iron. I used that for tools, and used the tools to make the hardware. But, enough of that,"" she continued. ""Where do you live?"" At last the man was forced to confess that he had been sleeping on the beach. 

""Well, let's row over to my place"", she said. So they both got into the row-boat and left for her side of island. The woman easily rowed them around to a wharf that led to the approach to her place. She tied up the row-boat with a beautifully woven hemp rope. They walked up a stone walk and around a Palm tree, there stood an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white.

""It's not much"", she said, ""but I call it home. Sit down please, would you like to have a drink?"" 

""No"", said the man, ""one more coconut juice and I will puke.""

""It won't be coconut juice"", the woman replied, ""I have a still, how about a Pina Colada?"" Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepted, and they sat down on her couch to talk. After a while, when they had exchanged their stories, the woman asked, ""Tell me, have you always had a beard?"" 

""No"", the man replied, ""I was clean shaven all of my life, and even on the cruise ship.""

""Well if you would like to shave, there is a man's razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom."" So, the man, no longer questioning anything, went upstairs to the bathroom. There in the cabinet was a razor made from a bone handle, two shells honed to a hollow ground edge were fastened on to its end inside of a swivel mechanism. The man shaved, showered and went back down stairs.

""You look great"", said the woman, ""I think I will go up and slip into something more comfortable."" So she did. And, the man continued to sip his Pina Colada. After a short time, the woman returned - this time wearing fig leafs strategically positioned and smelling faintly of gardenia.

""Tell me"", she asked, ""we have both been out here for a very long time with no companionship. You know what I mean. Have you been lonely, is there anything that you really miss? Something that all men and women need? Something that it would be really nice to have right now?""

""Yes there is,"" the man replied, as he moved closer to the woman while fixing a winsome gaze upon her, ""Tell me. Do you happen to have an internet connection; I need to check reddit?”",There was a male engineer on a cruise ship...,234

If you can read this whole story without laughing, then there's no hope for you. I was crying by the end. This is an actual account as relayed to paramedics at a chili cook-off in New Mexico. 


For those of you who have lived in New Mexico, you know how true this is. They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the Santa Fe Plaza. Judge #3 was an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting from Springfield, IL.


Frank: ""Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table, asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in... I was assured by the other two judges (Native New Mexicans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy; and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted and became Judge 3.""


Here are the scorecard notes from the event:



CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILE

Judge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.

Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.

Judge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. It took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These New Mexicans are crazy.



CHILE # 2 - EL RANCHO'S AFTERBURNER CHILE

Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang..

Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.



CHILI # 3 - ALFREDO'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI

Judge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chile. Great kick.

Judge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers.

Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting ****-faced from all of the beer.



CHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC

Judge # 1 -- Black bean chile with almost no spice. Disappointing.

Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chile.

Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the beer maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. This 300 lb. woman is starting to look HOT ... just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac?



CHILE # 5 - LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER

Judge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Jalapeno peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.

Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the jalapeno peppers make a strong statement.

Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted, and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really ticks me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw them.



CHILE # 6 - VARGA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY

Judge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers.

Judge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, garlic. Superb.

Judge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I crapped on myself when I farted, and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my butt with a snow cone.



CHILE # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI

Judge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. **I should take note that I am worried about judge number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.

Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing. It's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.



CHILE # 8 - BIG TOM'S TOENAIL CURLING CHILE

Judge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice
blend chile. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.

Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?

As he was walking up the driveway toward the front door of the house, a pig with three legs caught his eye. It was just hobbling through the grass.
When the farmer answered the door and asked what he was selling, the salesman first asked about the three legged pig.
""That pig is the most amazing pig in the land, son."" The farmer said
""Last year, our house caught fire when we were all asleep and that pig ran in and woke us all up one by one and saved our lives!""
The salesman was surprised. ""That is one special pig"" He said.
The Farmer replied, ""That's not all. Last summer, that pig jumped into the pond and dragged my drowning son to safety. He would have died.""
The salesman was in disbelief as to how incredible this pig was. ""One question. Why does he have 3 legs, is it from the fire?"" He asked

The train was quite crowded, and the Marine walked the entire length looking for a seat. There seemed to be one next to a well-dressed middle-aged French woman, but when he got there he saw it was taken by the woman's poodle. The war-weary Marine asked, ""Ma'am, may I have that seat?""

The Marine walked the entire train again, but the only seat available was under that dog. ""Please, Ma'am. May I sit down? I'm very tired."" She snorted, ""Not only are you Americans rude, you are also arrogant!"" This time the Marine didn't say a word; he just picked up the little dog, tossed it out the train window and sat down.

“YOU STUPID REDNECK!” shouted the lawyer, looking with contempt at the redneck in his dirty overalls.

“Now how am I gonna get outa this?” though the redneck to himself. Then he had an idea…

After looking over the impressive, impeccably dressed and dignified city lawyer in his $2,000 navy blue pinstriped suit, carefully knotted red silk tie, starched white shirt, silver cufflinks and black dress shoes polished like mirrors, $1,000 briefcase and hundred dollar haircut, the redneck walked back to his car, got out a bottle, and brought it back.

He handed it to the hotshot and said, “Here, you look pretty shook up. I think you ought to take a nip of this. It’ll steady your nerves….IT’S HOMEMADE…”

The lawyer did, but was so angry about the wreck, he refused to speak. The redneck then said, “You still look a little bit pale. How about another?” And the smug, pompous lawyer took another swallow. After a few minutes, he began to feel the heat of the sun through his wool suit.

Then the redneck said “It’s mighty hot today. Folks ’round here don’t usually wear shoes on a day like those. Why don’t you take off them fancy shoes, and the socks, too?”

The lawyer frowned: “Take off my shoes and socks? Do I LOOK like someone who would walk around barefoot? That’s fine for hicks, but not for a professional like ME! These are $500 shoes!”

But after a few more sips, the redneck asked him again, and then again, and then again, and finally the lawyer, feeling the white lightnin’, let out a laugh and took off his polished shoes and socks.
The redneck picked up the polished shoes and smiled. “Might fancy shoes you got here, boy!” Then the redneck said: “Why don’t you take off that fancy necktie?”

The lawyer said: “My tie!”, but in a minute, the silk tie was dropped on top of the shoes and the socks.

The redneck grinned and held up an extra pair of overalls he found in his pickup. “And that fancy business suit? You look kind of funny standing there barefoot in a suit on a 100 degree day! You can wear these while we figger out what to do about this situation! Just strip that suit off…”

The lawyer tried to give him an arrogant look, but he was feeling the heat of the sun and the liquor. He tried to resist, but…

Off came the jacket of the $2,000 pinstriped suit. Then the starched white shirt and the cufflinks. Finally, the trousers, too, and the lawyer pulled on the overalls.

“Now ain’t that more comfortable?!” said the redneck.

At the urging of the redneck, the lawyer then took another sip, and another, and another.

The suspenders and the cufflinks and the briefcase were all in a heap now, and the lawyer was having a hard time standing up. After another half hour, the lawyer said he was feeling pretty good, and asked the redneck if he didn’t think that he ought to have a little nip, too. Then he realized he couldn’t find the redneck…

“Not me”, the redneck replied, stepping out from behind a tree. The lawyer stared at him in shock, but was now so drunk he couldn’t stand up. The redneck was wearing the lawyer’s suit, shirt and tie, his feet were in the lawyer’s shoes and socks; he was holding his briefcase, shaving with a razor he found in the briefcase and holding the keys to his BMW.

The lawyer mumbled “You look like me! What…. Why… Give me my clothes back! Take off my shoes! My car…What are you….”

But he was so drunk he couldn’t move.

Then he reached over and pulled the Rolex off the lawyer’s wrist and as a final touch, rubbed some dirt into the lawyer’s manicured hands and expensive haircut.

theonewhowrites,2,11,1qk3ei,0,"A factory worker dressed in overalls, sat down to have his lunch in a park across from his office.

Then he noticed a very distinguished and dignified man step out of a top of the line BMW, walk into the park and sit down a few feet away on the grass; he was extremely well dressed in a hand tailored Brioni pinstriped business suit, perfectly tied silk necktie, starched white dress shirt, monogrammed cuff links, silver tiepin, Rolex watch, immaculately polished black leather shoes and silk socks. He placed his expensive briefcase next to him and prepared for lunch.

“One of those executives, I’ll bet” thought the factory worker, and after introducing himself, he found out he was right not only an executive, but an investment banker!

The factory worker glanced at the banker’s shoes, glistening in the sunlight.

“You have those polished every day, don’t you?” he asked.

The Investment Banker nodded “Just about. I have to look good for the clients. These were handmade for me. The first thing people notice are your shoes, at least in my line of work. And I keep the shoeshine men busy!”

The factory worker snapped “What about the poor? A few shoeshines would pay for a lot food. You “suits” are all alike! Tell me something. How much money did you pay for those fancy shoes?”

The Investment Banker looked surprised and said calmly “Eight hundred dollars”

The factory worker yelled “Just for ONE pair of shoes! How are you helping out other people? Never trust a suit! And how much was that suit?”

The banker said quietly: “Well, it’s none of your business but it was two thousand for the suit and two hundred for the tie and two hundred for the shirt, since you ask. I help them through taxes, but we all have a personal responsibility. Brioni pinstripes are expensive.”

The factory worker said “I’m telling you, the poor only need a chance! You should be GIVING them money; they haven’t had your advantages!”

The Investment Banker shrugged and said “We all have to work for what we have. I have worked VERY hard for what I have.”

“I saw you get out of that car. Pretty classy!” said the factory worker. “That BMW would pay for several cheap cars!”

“Yes, it is a classy car” said the banker smiling and pulled out his computer. “I am trading stocks so I would prefer some privacy”

The factory worker said “Stocks! Look, poverty can happen to anyone! There’s no way you can know that from where you sit with your high and mighty job and your car and your hotshot clothes! If you were not a SUIT, you would KNOW that! You need to know what it’s like to NOT be a suit!”

The Investment Banker smiled and said “Keep talking if you want to. When I sleep, nothing wakes me – and I mean NOTHING! I sleep like a rock.”

The investment banker put down his computer, sighed, relaxed on the grass and fell into a deep sleep.

Then a barefoot homeless man appeared holding whiskey, and asked the factory worker for change. The factory worker apologized, and said he had nothing, but then he saw the investment banker’s wallet in his suit pocket.

He had an idea. He slipped the wallet out, and handed it to the homeless man, ID, credit cards and all.

Then he had another idea – a riskier one. He looked at the banker’s feet.

Why not! This is a Suit who needs to give to society! The homeless man needs shoes, and the banker definitely needs to be humbled. 

“What size shoe?” he asked the homeless man.

“Ten!” 

He looked again at the feet of the sleeping investment banker. “Wait! I’m sure you need these more than he does.” He then started to slowly untie the investment banker’s mirror polished $800 shoes and very slowly and very carefully pulled them off his feet.

He looked inside. “Size ten! You’re in luck! Give me your whiskey and I’ll give you the shoes”

“Deal!’ said the homeless man.

“You have to have socks to go with these shoes!” he said, “and he won’t be needing socks now!” 

And even more carefully, he reached up under the banker’s suit cuffs to his knees and peeled the thin black dress socks off the banker’s legs, heels, soles and finally his toes, and held them up like trophies. He handed both shoes and socks to the homeless man, who grinned.

The factory worker said: “With my compliments! They are handmade and they were just polished! Somebody told me that the first thing people notice are your SHOES!”

The factory worker took the bottle of whiskey.

The investment banker, now barefoot, yawned, stretched, but continued to sleep; soon he started to snore again, while the bum walked off in the banker’s shoes.

“I guess he won’t be seeing any more clients today, and he’ll have to miss that board meeting”, said the factory worker to himself, “but he’ll be a much better person now that he’s humbled! I’m changing his destiny!”

An old man walked by and stared at the sleeping banker and the contrast between the tailored suit and his bare feet; he laughed out loud and walked on.

Then a mugger ran by, holding on to money he had just stolen. “A victim of society!” thought the factory worker.

He slid the keys to the BMW out of the banker’s suit pocket, threw them to the mugger, and pointed to the car.

The mugger didn’t stop to ask questions – he just drove off.

Then the factory worker saw a sad woman with a baby walking by. 

“Can I help you?” he asked her. When he found out that she needed money for her rent, the factory worker again approached the snoring investment banker and removed his cuff links; then he slipped the tiepin out of the silk tie.

“His wristwatch will be worth plenty!” said the factory worker to himself, and slipped the Rolex off the banker’s manicured hand. He handed them all to the delighted woman. “Sell these!” the factory worker cried. “Oh, thank you sir” said the woman, and ran off.

“It’s the least I can do!” said the factory worker.

He then thought: “Well, he has no more fancy shoes, no socks, no keys, no car, no ID or credit cards or wristwatch or license or money. I guess I’m turning him from a Suit into something much better! I might as well finish the job!”

The factory worker then noticed the banker’s computer and the password on a piece of paper. He sold all of the banker’s stocks and bonds, and gave the money to the charities.

Next, a man in a janitor’s uniform walked by, looking dejected.

“What’s the matter, my friend?” said the factory worker sympathetically. “I..lost my job. I have a chance for a better one, but I don’t have the clothes! This is all I have!” and he held up a pair of old polyester pants.

The factory worker sighed, and then looked at the banker’s navy blue pinstriped business suit.

“Would this help? It’s a two thousand dollar suit! A Brioni!” he asked the man.

“Sure!” cried the man “But how are you going to strip it off him?”

“Just watch and see!” said the factory worker.

He very slowly moved one of the banker’s arms and then the other and the banker rolled on to his stomach, still sleeping and removed the suit jacket.

“You could use a briefcase, too!” said the factory worker and opened up the investment banker’s briefcase.

He removed the contents and handed it to the joyful man. He also gave him the banker’s Blackberry and computer and password. Then he looked at the banker’s expensive silk tie and white shirt. Could he manage it?

He had to move the banker again a few times, but he only snored and slept as he untied the tie and pulled off the shirt. Then he unbuttoned the banker’s suspenders and pulled them off.

Triumphantly he handed the starched white shirt, suspenders and necktie to the man, leaving their formerly well-dressed owner in his t-shirt.

“Wait” the factory worker said. “You really need the full suit. Give me a hand and I’ll need those polyester pants. I’m getting good at this. taking his suit pants off him will be the hardest job yet” and with great care and trouble, set to work removing the suit trousers. 

Ten minutes later, the man was holding up the full pinstriped suit with admiration while its former owner was reduced to wearing the polyester pants.

He thanked the factory worker profusely and ran off, who brushed off his words: “I’m always glad to help those who need it! I’ve always been generous!”

“How good it is to help people!” he said to himself. “And mister hotshot isn’t a “Suit” anymore!”

He sprinkled some of the whiskey on the banker’s shirt and hair and placed the bottle next to him.

Twenty minutes later, a policeman walks up to the formerly impeccably dressed investment banker, slapped him on the soles of his naked size tens and snapped: “Hey buddy, wake up, no loitering! We don’t allow drunk bums to sleep here. I can smell it from here!”
Finally the investment banker woke up with a start and looked down at himself with astonishment.

There was nothing left of the perfectly dressed banker he had been when he fell asleep. He was barefoot, and wearing only cheap trousers and a t-shirt. It took him a moment to realize that his suit, shoes, socks, tie, shirt, watch, jewelry, money, credit cards, ID, computer and briefcase had all been stripped from him.

He turned to the factory worker in astonished fury. “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?! WHERE IS MY SUIT, MY TIE, MY SHIRT! WHERE ARE MY SHOES AND SOCKS!? MY BRIEFCASE! MY WALLET! HOW CAN I GO BACK TO MY OFFICE LIKE THIS!? I LOOK LIKE A BUM! I smell like a bum too!”

The factory worker then told him about his car and stocks. The banker began to yell.

The policeman then turned to the factory worker and said “Is this bum disturbing you?” and grabbed the struggling investment banker by the arm and says: “You can sleep it off in the tank, buddy! Vagrancy, disturbing the peace, resisting arrest, assaulting an officer, harassment!”

At that moment, his boss walked by on a stroll, saw his bedraggled employee being dragged away and cried out, “What are you doing?! You’re fired!”

Three months later, the factory worker wandered into the park, and saw the homeless man on the corner, as usual, wearing the same gleaming black shoes and socks, but now there was a new panhandler with him, barefoot with matted hair and a grizzled face, wearing polyester pants and a T-shirt. 

“It can’t be!” he says, as he walked up to him. But it is.

The homeless man looked up and winked: “He’s one of us now!” he said laughing “And I’m even wearing HIS fancy shoes!”

The expensive haircut and the manicure were gone, along with everything else, and the former investment banker is now an unemployed homeless bum with a criminal record; he had been thrown out of his condo and his wife had left him. It’s hard to believe this was the same confident man in the expensive suit and the polished shoes he had seen that day in the park.

“I have been stripped of everything and my life is destroyed. Spare change, sir? Can I give you a shoeshine?” said the banker-turned-panhandler, without looking up. He pulled out a shoeshine kit.

“Forget it!” snapped the factory worker. “Get a job! Those Suits! They never think it will happen to them!”

During one of the Papal processions, he manages to make his way to the front of the barrier as the Pontiff walks past them. Instead, the Pope completely blanks the man, and stops several metres after him and stoops down to talk to an old and ragged-looking homeless person. The wealthy man is insanely jealous, and later finds the homeless person that the Pope had talked to and offers him his own fine suit as well as €2000, in exchange for the hobo's rags, to which the man greatly obliges.

The next day, the man positions himself in his ""new"" hobo clothing in  roughly the same spot the original man was in the previous day. And sure enough, as the Pope came down the procession, he stopped by the homeless man, bent down and whispered in his ear:

The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce. The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank’s president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank’s underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, “Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?” The blond replies…..”Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?”",Who doesn't enjoy a blonde joke,22

 Now this is before all the austerity stuff was really kicking in,and he fells like he deserves a bit of a treat since hes been doing some great Popeing lately so he wanders into the Mercedes dealership and like a good German Lad,heads directly to the AMG`s.

And there is the one he figures will be a great upgrade.It's white, so it still goes with the uniform,but it's a 700 horse power twin superchaged monster of a car.Not exactly practical,but the Holy Father reckons he could get the back end redone with a nice low profile glass box for waving and blessing.

So he talks to the dealer,who is pretty awestruck that the Pope,..*The FUCKING POPE!* is in his dealership asking about zero to sixty times.

""Whats it's top speed?""
""Is it much of a hassel to disable the speed limiters?""

Then the Pope asks,""Can we go for a test run?"" and ""Do you think I could drive? The Cardinals never let me up front when I'm working.""

Well,the dealer is not going to say no to the Pope,even though company policy is as definative as Leviticus on the subject of clients in the driverseats of the high end performance models.He say's ""Sure thing your Holiness"" and they head out for a quick spin around Rome.

Well its not long before the special red leather papal slippers are putting far to much torque to the road and then of course **Wha wha,Wha wha,** up pops the Law on a bike from nowhere and he pulls over the crisp white AMG and saunters over to the car with ticket book in hand.

""Drivers licence and regis,......""
The Policeman does a double take,and tries again,but words fail him,Looks at the Driver..is that?....No it can't be,....but,....Looks at the passenger,the driver again.

After a moments confused silence he just raises a finger and says ""Excuse me please ,I'll just be one moment.""

And so he does the best thing he could do in this situation,call the base and ask them what he should do.

""Hello Chief? Yeah I've pulled over someone really REALLY powerful for speeding and I don't want to cause an incident without talking to someone higher up about it....""

""Who is it?,..Well I'm not sure,but he has *The Pope* as his chauffeur""

""Okay, just give me your credit card number and address and a representative will be with you shortly.""

""If you can catch me, you can have me,"" she whispers seductively. Pushing past him into the house, she begins to run around playfully. The fat man chases her as quickly as he can but his overweight condition means he is barely managing to crawl by the time he catches her and does what he wants with her.

Afterwards, the woman says ""Quick, check the scales!"" and sure enough, he's lost 5 kg.

The next day he rings up again and says ""I want to lose 10 kg!"" so he gives them his credit card number and waits. Soon there is another knock at the door and this time an even more beautiful woman is standing there, yet again completely naked.

""If you can catch me, you can have me,"" she mouths seductively as she runs into the house. This one is even faster than the last one and the man is about to collapse when he finally grabs her and does what he wants with her.

‘Al-Gebra is a problem for us’, the Attorney General said. ‘They derive solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in search of absolute values.’ They use secret code names like “X” and “Y” and refer to themselves as “unknowns” but we have determined that they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country.

One day, he got an assignment from the local mob to take out a man who owed huge amounts of money and was refusing to pay it back. Artemis took the job, but the man turned out to be almost impossible to find. The target would seemingly vanish whenever Artemis was in the vicinity and tracking him was practically impossible.

However, one day Artemis got a call from his boss. The man had been spotted at a local Kroger and, since nobody knew when he would appear again, Artemis was to strangle the man in the store. Artemis was reluctant at first, but he was getting very tired of the long project and agreed to track the man inside.

Luckily, Artemis was able to corner the man in the produce aisle and strangle him. Unluckily, just as he was laying the man's body down, a woman came around the corner. Artemis panicked and in his desperation strangled the woman, only to see a poor store clerk out of the corner of his eye. Artemis strangled this man too. Finally, a manager came around the corner and also met his end.

All of this became too much for Artemis to cover up and he was arrested outside of the store. The next day, the local paper ran the headline:

loopmoploop,14,20,1q57gh,77,"Benny. One day, Benny was strolling along the banks of the Nile, minding his own business. However, he came across an urn, buried in the sand. The urn was all dusty and dented and cracked and bent and generally broken. However, Benny decided to rub the urn with his sleeve, thinking he might be able to get a few coins out of it. But suddenly, out of the urn came a Genie!

The genie stretched and yawned and said: ""Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much! I can't tell you how long I've been in that urn! You're a lucky man, fella. Very lucky.""

""Why?"" said Benny.

""Because you've got wishes coming your way, friend. Three, to be exact.""

So Benny thought for a while and said, ""Ok, I want some new threads."" And thus he got a fancy toga. And then he said ""I could use a new house."" And a fancy mansion made of fine marble popped up.

Finally, Benny said: ""And, for my final wish, I'd like to be immortal. I wanna live forever.""

The genie was taken back a bit and thought for a while: ""Well, that's, um, that's a bit of an expensive wish, you see. Hm. Tell you what. I'll make you immortal, but on one condition. You can never, ever, shave your beard or cut your hair. If you do, you're gonna get sucked into an urn. That's how I ended up like this. Deal?""

""Deal,"" said Benny.

So the Genie granted his wish and Benny began wandering the world. He saw Rome rise and fall, the Dark Ages get lighter, the New World grow and prosper. He went all over the planet, from China to Germany to Canada to Brazil. But all this time, Benny had never fallen in love.

But one day, Benny came across a beautiful woman on the beach. He walked up to her and introduced himself. And as the woman brushed the hair out of his face they gazed into each other's eyes, and it was love at first sight. They danced and they laughed and they sung, and it was a happy time for both of them.

One day, on the same beach they had met on, Benny got down on one knee and asked the woman to marry him. The woman thought for a while.

""Benny,"" she said, ""I'll marry you. But only if you shave your beard and cut your hair. It's long and dirty and full of rats, and whenever we go to see a movie it takes up eight seats.""

Benny sat down and mulled this over. The Genie and the urn were long gone, he thought. Who would notice if he cut his hair and shaved his beard. He happily agreed, and went to the pharmacy and bought 400 disposable razors and 25 cans of shaving cream.

He went into the bathroom, and waved to his girlfriend, saying he'd be out in a bit. You could hear the *chic, chic* of the razor and the *pst, pst* of the shaving cream. Then suddenly, it all went quiet.

His girlfriend, after a while, knocked on the door. *Tap tap* ""Benny?"" *Tap Tap* ""Benny?!"" *TAP TAP* ""BENNY?!?""

Finally she pushed open the door, and on the ground lay around 8 cubic yards of hair, and an urn.

Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up on 
that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, 
""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" 
I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.
My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, 
""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" 

It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.
 I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me."" 

I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""
We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. 
She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. 

We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.
On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?"" 
I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" 

She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, 
""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""

The man, curious, peers into the box, and sure enough- there is a slew of personified cookies!  They are just groovin' out, having a grand time.  The man recognizes that this defies many of the laws of the universe and decides to purchase the cookies.  

Satisfied, he takes the box and puts it in his trunk.  He begins to drive home.  He lives on a hill overlooking a lake, and when he starts to ascend it, he hears a terrible clanking sound.  He freaks out, believing that it may be his engine breaking down, and subsequently pulls over.  He gets out of the car, and with the engine off, the sound is still prominent.  He opens the trunk and realizes that it is coming from the dancing cookies!  

He opens the box and tells them, ""Cookies, please stop, that really scared me.""  They agree to subside, and the man continues driving up the hill.  After another few minutes, however, a similar sound occurs.  Just to be safe, the man pulls over again.  He opens the trunk, and it is indeed the dancing cookies.  ""Sorry dude, we just couldn't contain ourselves,"" the cookies explained in unison.  ""Okay,"" says the man.  ""But if you do it one more time I'm going to get very upset.""  

He keeps driving up the hill and it happens again.  ""THAT'S THE LAST STRAW, COOKIES!"" the man shouts after opening the box.  ""IF YOU DANCE LIKE THAT AGAIN BEFORE WE GET HOME I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU AND THROW YOU IN THE LAKE!""  

The cookies peer up with fear in their eyes and agree to adhere to his requests.  

But alas, they are unable.  Mere yards before reaching the man's home, the car starts making terrible noises.  The man brakes violently in the middle of the road, opens the door, scrambles to the trunk, opens it, takes the box of dancing cookies, and throws them in the lake.

*Sorry about that.  That was mean.  Here's a real joke to make up for it:*

A fellow named John decides he wants to ask his girlfriend of three years- Elizabeth- for her hand in marriage.  He takes her out to the restaurant where they had their first date, and they are seated.  ""I'm going to run into the restroom,"" John says, but he steps outside for some fresh air.  He's nervous about what he's going to say.  He takes the diamond ring from his pocket and starts going over what he's going to say.  

""Elizabeth, will you marry me?"" John mutters under his breath.  His hands are shaking and in his nervousness the ring falls from his hands and down the storm drain on the curb.  

John freaks out, frantically trying to determine where it could be going.  He had spent so much of his savings on this ring!  But in recognition that finding it would be unlikely, he goes back inside to enjoy his dinner.  The waitress comes over and he orders a salad.  Elizabeth asks, ""Could you tell me about your trout?""  The waitress replies, ""Yes, it is quite delicious... we catch it from the river right by our restaurant.  

Elizabeth is convinced and orders the trout.  It comes out a half hour later.  She cuts into the fish and what's inside?

curf,3,20,1puq05,48,"The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent events in Syria and have therefore raised their security level from “Miffed” to “Peeved.” Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to “Irritated” or even “A Bit Cross.” The English have not been “A Bit Cross” since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorized from “Tiresome” to “A Bloody Nuisance.” The last time the British issued a “Bloody Nuisance” warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.


The Scots have raised their threat level from “Pissed Off” to “Let’s get the Bastards.” They don’t have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.


The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from “Run” to “Hide.” The only two higher levels in France are “Collaborate” and “Surrender.” The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France’s white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country’s military capability.


Italy has increased the alert level from “Shout Loudly and Excitedly” to “Elaborate Military Posturing.” Two more levels remain: “Ineffective Combat Operations” and “Change Sides.”


The Germans have increased their alert state from “Disdainful Arrogance” to “Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.” They also have two higher levels: “Invade a Neighbour” and “Lose.”


Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels …


The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.


Australia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from “No worries” to “She’ll be right, Mate.” Two more escalation levels remain: “Crikey! I think we’ll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!” and “The barbie is cancelled.” So far no situation has ever warranted use of the last final escalation level.",Terrorism is a serious issue,68

psychiatrist asked why, and the child replied, ""All of these toys
are new, and if I start playing with them I'm afraid I might
break one, and then I'd get in trouble.""

So the psychiatrist led the other outside to a huge pile of horse
manure. The child immediately dove in, scooping out handfuls with a huge smile on his face.   The psychiatrist asked why the child was
doing that, he replied ""with all this horse shit, there has
to be a pony around here somewhere, and I'm gonna find it.""",Something about an optimist and a pessimist. I couldn't think of a good title for this one.,45

About two weeks later, his son, who they had been very attached to after the miscarriage, had walked out into traffic, and was struck and killed by a car. Then blame starts to get thrown around. His wife leaves him, taking the house and all of his money and possessions that he had worked hard for, and she started having sex with a body builder. Barry was devastated, financially and emotionally. He contemplated suicide. But no, he decided that to bring excitement back into his life, he would rob a train.

He gets his revolver, and heads onto a train. When the ticket taker comes around to take his ticket, he pulls out the gun. ""Nobody move or you get shot!"" he shouted. People complied with him. He took everyone's money. It had worked, he finally had some excitement in his life again. He was so happy, that he didn't even notice the police coming on board to arrest him. The police asked him why he did it and he said, ""I don't know, it all just started going downhill. My whole life was ruined. I honestly thought in the back of my mind that it could bring my son back."" ""That's a very weird reason,"" the cop replied, and put him in the police car.

He was in jail, miserable that he was no longer excited. Then the other guy in the cell asked him, ""What you in for?"" ""I robbed a train,"" Barry replied. The man replied, ""Why'd ya do it?"" ""I wanted some excitement in my life. I don't know, I thought it might bring my son back,"" Barry replied. ""That's a pretty strange cause, eh?"" ""Yeah.""

Barry was meeting with his lawyer to discuss how they should take this case. ""Well, did you do it?"" his lawyer asked. ""Yeah,"" Barry replied. ""Why?"" ""I don't know. I needed some excitement in my life, and I guess I thought it would bring my son back."" His lawyer was dumbfounded, but managed to say, ""That's a peculiar impetus, don't you think?"" ""Uh-huh,"" Barry said back.

Barry finally got to his court day. He knew he was going to plead guilty, he had to. ""All rise for the honorable judge Wilson presiding."" The judge came in, and everyone took their seats. The judge looks at Barry, then at his papers, and says, ""It states here that you robbed a train, because you needed excitement in your life and you thought it would bring you son back."" 

And Barry replied, ""It was a loco motive.""",Barry's life took a turn for the worse [OC],219

""I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?"" questioned one of the men.

""Over the years, many misconceptions of heaven have arose. Yes, it's a pretty nice place. No, its not perfect, but its close. You see the only problem are the ducks. If you step on a duck it will begin to quack and then all the other ducks will begin to quack and its simply a nuisance for us all."" Saint Peter replied.

The three men looked at each other, shrugged, and entered heaven. As far as the eye could see there were ducks everywhere. Almost immediately one of the men accidentally stepped on a duck. Just as Peter had said, the duck began to quack and then the ducks around him began an audible tidal wave of quacks. 

Soon after the quacks had passed, Saint Peter approached the men in hand with a hag of a woman. Without a word, he shackled the hag to the man that stepped on the duck and left.

The other two men were careful not to step on a duck. Although they tried there best, one of them eventually stepped on a duck. The same phenomenon of before arose and Saint Peter arrived again with a huge amazonian woman. He shackled the woman to the man and left.

The final man treaded with care and spent many days and nights successfully stepping around the ducks. After a while, Saint Peter approached the man with a beautiful woman. He shackled the woman to the man and left without a word.

After a lot of discussion, she did shove one up his little brown eyeball.  He immediately ran out in the yard and took a huge dump, which was the objective.  

But, the first thing that flew out his ass was the suppository.  A large black crow was in one of our trees, and as soon as it shot out his a-hole, the bird flew down, picked it up, and flew off.

She tells him his grandparents are on the way and asks if he can go check on his brothers and dad to see if they're ready. The little boy obeys and wonders off to his brothers room. His brother is quite a bit older and has his girlfriend over. As he's getting closer he hears the two yelling.

""You're a BITCH!""

""YOU'RE A BASTARD!""

The little boy, not understanding what's going on, walks into the room oblivious to what's going on. He looks up at his brother and asks ""what's a bitch?"" His brother, seriously flustered at being interrupted, stammers out ""uhhh it's just a nice thing to call a girl"" the little boy accepts the answer and asks ""well then what's a bastard?"" the brother tells him ""that's just.. uhh.. the same thing except for a boy"" the little boy accepts the answer and tells his brother that his grandma and grandpa are on their way.

The little boy goes down the hall to his other brothers room, who is also quite a bit older, and also has his girlfriend over. He hears yelling coming from that room too and gets closer to hear what's going on. 

""OH GOD LET ME FEEL YOUR DICK!""

""UNNHNHHHGGHHH YOU HAVE THE NICEST TITS!""

The little boy, oblivious to what’s happening, barges in and hears a loud screech come from his brother. His brother yells at him to get out but the little boy insists on knowing what a dick and tits are. The big brother infuriated by being cock blocked by his brother spouts off ""it's just a hat and a coat now get out of here!""

The little boy obviously confused by all of this continues down the hall to his parent room. He walks in quietly on his dad shaving and starts to tell him about the grandparent's. The dad, not realizing the little boy had been there is startled and lets out a loud

""OH SHIT!""

The little boy jumps back, being startled himself. He looks up at his dad and says ""What's shit daddy?"" his dad looks down confused and frustrated. Coming up with something on the spot he tells the boy ""It's just the new shaving cream I'm using. Now go tell your mom that I'll be down in a minute.""

The little boy wonders back downstairs to tell his mom. He walks into the kitchen where his mom is stuffing the turkey. Knowing he had scared his dad he thought it would be funny to try the same trick on his mom. He sneaks up on his mom and yells ""BOO!"" She jumped up and lets out a extremely loud 

""OH FUUUUCK!""

The little boy snickers at scaring his mom and tells her that his dad will be down in a minute. After that he asks her ""what's a fuck?"" his mom tells him ""It's the kind of stuffing I'm using in the turkey."" 

After this exchange the little boy hears the doorbell ring. His mom, still busy stuffing the turkey, asks the little boy to answer the door. She says ""I'm sure that's your grandparents so be polite."" 

The little boy runs, opens the door and sees his grandparents standing there. He announces in a loud voice ""Hello bitch and bastard, may I take your tits and dick?""

The grandparents confused and infuriated at the little boys language insist on the little boy telling him where his parents are so they can talk with them.

The little boy happily tells them ""Well dad's upstairs shaving the shit off his face and mom is in the kitchen fucking the turkey""

The Genie says ""I am a genie and I will grant the two of you any three wishes you would like"".  

Bob says ""FABULOUSSSS"" and asks for a beachfront bed and breakfast for he and his boyfriend to own and run.  *poof*, it was done.  Bob's boyfriend Joe gets the next wish, and asks for ten million dollars in cash in suitcases to be dropped off at their room at the new bed and breakfast.  The genie does a little head shake and *poof* it is done.  

Now that this couple is set for life, and have asked and been granted a wish individually, they decide it would be best to do a wish they both agreed on for the third and final one.  

Joe asks the Genie, ""Can we think about our third wish and get back to you tomorrow?""  The genie replies, ""Of course, whenever you are ready, rub the lamp again and I will grant you your third wish."" 

The happy (and now rich) couple stroll over to their new bed and breakfast they own, and sleep on their third wish.  

Right around 3am, a loud ""BANG! BANG! BANG!"" on their door wakes them right up.  Before they could even consider whether they wanted to answer at this ungodly hour, the door gets kicked down.  

Half a dozen KKK members in full gown storm the room.  They drag Bob and Joe out of their room, out the front door, and to the front yard of their new bed and breakfast.  Outside there are even more Klan members, angry and screaming.  

The KKK takes two ropes, throws them up over a branch on the tree out front, and begin to tie a noose.  Things are not looking good for Bob and Joe.  

Bob leans over to Joe and says, ""Hey Joe, this might be a really good time to use our last wish that genie owes us, where is that lamp?""

Joe says, ""I'm really sorry Bob, but I already used our last wish"".  

Bob is understandably upset: ""WTF JOE, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?  WE WERE SUPPOSED TO SHARE THE THIRD WISH!!!!!  WTF DID YOU EVEN WISH FOR???""

UTBFlame,6,66,1pndwl,188,"There were these two friends, who died in a horrible car accident.  They both went to heaven and were standing at the pearly gates when St. Peter met them.  St. Peter asked the first man for a picture of his wife. After looking at the picture, St. Peter asked him if he had ever cheated on her.  The man replied, ""I was unfaithful to my wife one time."" St. Peter decided to give the man a station-wagon for him to drive around heaven. Now it was the second man's turn.

AmiriteClyde,1,15,1pna76,71,"Two hillbillies walk into a restaurant. While having a bite to eat, they talk about their moonshine operation. Suddenly, an old woman at a nearby table, who is eating a sandwich, begins to cough. After a minute or so, it becomes apparent that she is in real distress. 

One of the hillbillies looks at her and says, Kin ya swallar?' The woman shakes her head no. Then he asks, 'Kin ya breathe?' The woman begins to turn blue, and shakes her head no. The hillbilly walks over to the woman, lifts up her dress, yanks down her drawers, and quickly gives her right butt cheek a lick with his tongue. 

The woman is so shocked that she has a violent spasm, and the obstruction flies out of her mouth.As she begins to breathe again, the Hillbilly walks slowly back to his table.

 His partner says, 'Ya know, I'd heerd of that there 'Hind Lick Maneuver' but I ain't niver seed nobody do it!'",Two hillbillies and an old lady,86

He is staring lovingly at her, lost in fleeting glimpses of the past, when a nurse enters the room carrying a pan of water, a sponge tucked under her arm. The man nods, kisses his wife on the forehead, and leaves the room. Several minutes have passed. He is alone in the hallway when the door opens and the nurse approaches him excitedly. Embarrassed now, she tells the man that when she tended to his wife's private parts during the sponge bath, his wife had moaned. She whispers that perhaps oral sex can bring her out of her coma! Puzzled, but willing to try anything, the man agrees and enters his wife's room while the nurse now waits in the hall. Minutes later, an alarm sounds from the equipment monitoring his wife. The nurse rushes into the room and sees the man at the head of his wife's bed, zipping up his pants. ""I think she choked.'"", he exclaims.","A man is in a hospital, holding vigil at his wife's bedside...",42

EarthTraveller,50,978,1pn07t,1587,"The doctor told the husband that they couldn't graft any skin from his body because he was too skinny. So the wife offered to donate some of her own skin.

However, the only skin on her body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from her buttocks. The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the Skin came from and they requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter.

After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the man's new face.He looked more handsome than he ever had before! All his friends and relatives just went on and on about his youthful beauty!

One day, he was alone with his wife, and he was overcome with emotion at her sacrifice. He said, 'Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. How can I possibly repay you?'

'My darling' she replied,' I get all the thanks I need every time I see your mother kiss you on the cheek.'",A married couple was in a terrible accident where the Man's face was severely burned.,2565
timpanimaster,0,7,1pmzq8,14,"A man walks into a bar holding up his forearm to the side of his face carrying on a business conversation. The bartender watches the man continue his conversation for a good 30 minutes before removing his forearm from his face and pushing his forearm with his thumb. The bartender, believing this man to be a crazy drug addict, says ""Get the hell out of here, I don't serve drug addicts!"". The man had a bewildered look on his face until he put two and two together and says  ""No, you misunderstand. I am in sales and I got tired of carrying my cellphone around and leaving it in hotels, bars, and my car so I had it implanted in my arm"". The bartender says ""bullshit"" the man says ""No, seriously call someone"". The bartender grabs the mans forearm and sure enough there where visible buttons and he decides to call his wife. After carrying on a conversation with his wife for a good ten minutes the bartender lets go of the mans arm and says ""I'm sorry to doubt you, but that is amazing"". The man accepts the apology and asks the bartender where the bathroom is, the bartender points to the corner and the man excuses himself. Several hours pass and the bartender has not seen or heard from the man so he decides he better check on him, as the bartender enters the bathroom he finds the man butt naked with toilet paper sticking out his his ass grasping onto the walls of the stall doors. The bartender says ""What the hell!!"". The man says ""Oh sorry I am just waiting for a fax to come in"". ",Technology Man,21
moonwalkersb,34,26,1pmzdr,0,"""So my friend came up to me the other day and was upset and complaining about the double standard of woman having sex as opposed to men (she's a girl obviously) and she asked, why is it that when guys have sex with a lot of people they are considered awesome and cool but if girls do the same they get called a whore and are made fun of?...

so i simply replied, think of it this way- if you have a key that opens every door, it is considered a master key. but if you have a lock that is opened by every key, it's considered a shitty lock""
